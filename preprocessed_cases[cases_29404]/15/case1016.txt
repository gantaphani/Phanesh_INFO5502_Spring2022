defendants citigroup,citibank federal savings bank,citibank south dakota,and citibank usa,appeal from an order denying their petition to compel arbitration of an unfair competition action filed by plaintiffs rochelle jones and theresa wilens under business and professions code section.they contend provisions of the applicable credit card agreements bar plaintiffs class and private attorney general actions and require individual arbitration.defendants argue the court erred by applying california rather than south dakota law to find the ban on class and representative arbitrations unconscionable and that such a ban is not unconscionable.we agree plaintiffs have not shown procedural unconscionability and therefore the arbitration provision may be enforced.we remand for the superior court to issue a new order granting the petition to compel arbitration.
facts and procedural background 
plaintiffs filed an action,individually and as private attorneys general,under business and professions code section alleging defendants violated civil code section by failing to make required disclosures about finance charges and interest rates incurred when using a check drawn against a credit card account.the complaint alleges defendants recovered transaction fees and finance charges from credit card holders who used the convenience checks.jones also brought her claim on behalf of a putative class limited to california residents.
defendants filed a motion to compel plaintiffs to arbitrate their claims on an individual basis and to stay the action based on a provision in the credit card agreements.in support of their motion,defendants submitted a declaration setting out the terms of the credit card agreements with plaintiffs.they provided the laws of south dakota and the united states would govern.they also stated that defendants could change this agreement at any time.after plaintiffs opened their accounts,defendants sent to plaintiffs with their billing statements a document entitled notice of change in terms regarding binding arbitration to your citibank card agreement.bold omitted.the front of their billing statements contained the following language please see the enclosed change in terms notice for important information about the binding arbitration provision we are adding to your citibank card agreement.capitalization omitted.
the change in terms notice,or bill stuffer,described the addition of a binding arbitration provision to the cardholder agreement.it stated that either defendants or plaintiffs may,without the other consent,elect mandatory,binding arbitration for any claim,dispute,or controversy between them.it also provided that all claims based on the current or a prior account or the relationship between the parties were subject to arbitration.
the change in terms notice also advised plaintiffs if you do not wish to accept the binding arbitration provision contained in this change in terms notice,you must notify us in writing within days after the date indicated on your current billing statement stating your non acceptance if you notify us by that time that you do not accept the binding arbitration provisions contained in this change in terms notice,you can continue to use your card s under your existing terms until the end of your current membership year or the expiration date on your card s,whichever is later.at that time your account will be closed and you will be able to pay off your remaining balance under your existing terms.neither plaintiff opted out of the arbitration agreement.
included within the arbitration agreement was the following language please read this provision of the agreement carefully.it provides that any dispute may be resolved by binding arbitration.arbitration replaces the right to go to court,including the right to a jury and the right to participate in a class action or similar proceeding.in arbitration,a dispute is resolved by an arbitrator instead of a judge or jury.arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than court procedures.capitalization and bold omitted.
the agreement also stated claims must be brought in the name of an individual person or entity and must proceed on an individual,basis.the arbitrator will not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party.if you or we require arbitration of a claim,neither you,we,nor any other person may pursue the claim in arbitration as a class action,private attorney general action or other representative action,nor may any such claim be pursued on your or our behalf in any litigation in any court.claims,including assigned claims,of two or more persons may not be joined or consolidated in the same arbitration.another portion of the notice reiterated this provision,stating claims and remedies sought as part of a class action,private attorney general or other representative action are subject to arbitration on an individual,basis,and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual,basis.
the agreement stated it was governed by the federal arbitration act faa.it also provided that the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the faa the agreement excluded small claims actions from arbitration.
within approximately six months of the amendment to the agreement,jones opened a second credit card account with defendants.the original agreement for the second account contained the arbitration provisions.
in opposing the motion to compel arbitration,plaintiffs did not file their own declarations or object to any portion of defendants declaration.the court denied the motion,finding that the exclusion of class and representative actions is unconscionable under california law.
discussion 
defendants set out several arguments as to why the court erred in denying their motion to compel arbitration.these include its refusal to engage in a choice of law analysis with the conclusion south dakota law would govern interpretation of the arbitration agreement its failure to find the faa controls and preempts application of california law to invalidate the arbitration provision based on unconscionability and its failure to find the arbitration provision enforceable.
after the case was briefed and argued,the california supreme court rendered its decision in a case containing similar issues,discover bank superior court cal th,d,discover.we afforded the parties the opportunity to file supplemental briefs.discover provides the framework for resolution of this case.
in discover the court conclude d that,at least under some circumstances,the law in california is that class action waivers in consumer contracts of adhesion are unenforceable,whether the consumer is being asked to waive the right to class action litigation or the right to classwide arbitration.discover,supra,cal th at,d.in that case the defendant issued a credit card to the plaintiff.the cardholder agreement did not contain an arbitration provision.subsequently,by using a change of terms notice included with the bill,the defendant amended the agreement to bar class action and private attorney general arbitrations.the amendment also provided that if a cardholder did not agree to arbitration,he or she was required to notify the bank and stop using the credit card continued use of the card would be deemed acceptance of the amended terms.
because there was a choice of law dispute that was remanded back to the appellate court for determination,the discover court did not decide the enforceability of the ban on classwide arbitration at issue in its case.and it did not hold that all class action waivers are necessarily unconscionable.discover,supra,cal th at,d.rather,it held that when the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then,at least to the extent the obligation at issue is governed by california law,the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own
