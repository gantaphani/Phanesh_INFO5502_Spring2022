chase manhattan moved to dismiss the complaint for improper joinder because it had not extended an offer of credit to richard kennedy that offer was extended by boa.chase manhattan also filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for summary judgment.chase manhattan argued that sections c and did not apply to it because it was not a consumer reporting agency it had not violated section by obtaining information under false pretenses because sally kennedy granted permission to review her credit history and its actions did not constitute unfair and deceptive trade practices because it had a legal right to decline to extend credit to consumers not meeting its criteria.
the kennedys opposed the motion to dismiss for improper joinder,arguing that they had community property and that when one member was denied credit or had his or her credit history damaged,it affected the other.they also opposed chase manhattan motion to dismiss or for summary judgment,arguing that the act applied not only to credit reporting agencies,but also to the users of this information.the kennedys asserted that a creditor may obtain a credit report without the consumer permission only when the creditor meets the conditions set forth in section c,which allows consumers for offers of credit.in particular,they contended a condition of obtaining a credit report is that if the consumer meets the criteria established by the creditor prior to the selection of the consumer for the offer,the creditor must make a firm offer of credit to the consumer.if the consumer accepts this offer,the creditor may obtain a second credit report to verify that the consumer continues to meet the selection criteria.they contend the creditor is not allowed to apply a new set of criteria to the second credit report in order to disqualify a consumer from the credit offer after the consumer has accepted the offer.
sally kennedy averred that her credit history did not change between the time that she was selected for the offer of credit and the time that she accepted it,although this assertion is not set forth in the complaint.she asserted that chase manhattan did not indicate that any further conditions were made on the offer.she contended that the offer of credit evidenced the fact that she satisfied chase manhattan credit criteria and that chase manhattan violated the act by not extending this credit to her after it obtained her credit report without her knowledge.she argued that this constituted obtaining the credit report under false pretenses and that informing the consumer of,but not honoring this offer,constituted an unfair trade practice.
chase manhattan responded that the act was amended in to allow creditors to extend conditional firm offers to consumers.chase manhattan asserted that pursuant to section c,consumer reporting agencies are permitted to furnish only limited information to creditors during the process and that after the consumer responds to the credit offer the creditor is permitted to access the creditor credit report to determine whether the consumer satisfies its criteria for credit worthiness.chase manhattan contended that after reviewing sally kennedy complete credit history it determined that she did not satisfy its criteria for credit worthiness.
the district court granted chase manhattan motion to dismiss and held the motion for improper joinder moot.the court determined that section c applied not only to credit reporting agencies but also to the entities requesting credit information.the court agreed with the bank assertion that it had the legal right to decline credit to consumers who fail to satisfy its credit criteria,that the credit application informed sally kennedy of this possibility,and that sally kennedy signature on the application evidenced her agreement to those terms.the court held that a firm offer under the act means a firm offer if you meet certain criteria and that dissatisfaction with the process did not state a cause of action under the act.the court also held that the state law claims were preempted by the act.
boa,transunion,and experian also filed motions to dismiss.the district court granted all three motions,citing the reasons set forth in its order granting chase manhattan motion to dismiss.the kennedys then moved for rehearing on the banks motions,but the district court denied the motion for rehearing.the district court then entered judgment in favor of all defendants.the kennedys timely appealed.in their appeal,the kennedys maintain their complaint states a cause of action and that the district court erred by dismissing their claims.
