this case returns to us from the supreme court.defendants american express company and american express travel related services company together,amex sought review from the supreme court following our decision in in re american express merchants litigation,cir.there,we considered the enforcement of a mandatory arbitration clause in a commercial contract also containing a class action waiver,that is,a provision which forbids the parties to the contract from pursuing anything other than individual claims in the arbitral forum.we found the class action waiver unenforceable,because enforcement of the clause would effectively preclude any action seeking to vindicate the statutory rights asserted by the plaintiffs.in re am.express,at.
on may,the supreme court granted amex writ for certiorari,vacating and remanding for reconsideration in light of its decision in animalfeeds int l.the parties submitted supplemental briefing discussing the impact,if any,of on our original decision,and we find no need for oral argument.finding our original analysis unaffected by,we again reverse the district court decision and remand for further proceedings,as discussed below.
background 
because the only issue before us is the narrow question of whether the class action waiver provision contained in the contract between the parties should be enforced,we provide but a brief recitation of the facts.
procedural posture.the plaintiffs appealed from the march,judgment of the united states district court of the southern district of new york,which granted amex motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the federal arbitration act faa and.b.see in re am.express merchs,cv,wl march,daniels.
a.the parties.the amended complaint alleges that amex is the leading issuer of general purpose and corporate charge cards to consumers and businesses in the united states and throughout the world.it is also the leading provider of charge card services to merchants.the named plaintiffs are california and new york corporations which operate businesses which have contracted with amex and the national supermarkets association,nsa,a voluntary trade association that represents the interests of independently owned supermarkets.
the named plaintiffs seek to represent the following class 
all merchants that have accepted american express charge cards including the american express corporate card,and have thus been forced to agree to accept american express credit and debit cards,during the longest period of time permitted by the applicable statute of limitations throughout the united states 
c.the card acceptance agreement.the basic contractual relationship between amex and the plaintiffs was set forth in an affidavit of an amex executive 
american express issues card products to its cardmembers,which cardmembers then use in making purchases from participating merchants.participating merchants with annual charge volume expected to be less than million agree that,by submitting charges for payment by american express,their relationship will be governed by the terms and conditions for american express card acceptance the card acceptance agreement.
the card acceptance agreement is a standard form contract issued by amex.it may be terminated by either party at any time by sending written notice to the other party.further,amex reserves the right 
to change this agreement at any time.we will notify you of any change in writing at least ten calendar days in advance.if the changes are unacceptable to you,you may terminate this agreement as described in the section entitled terminating this agreement.
according to amex,the card acceptance agreement has expressly permitted amendments upon notice for more than years.the card acceptance agreement also contains a choice of law provision designating new york law as governing and,as amex states,there is no dispute that the agreement has always contained this provision.
by contrast,it is only since that the card acceptance agreement has contained a mandatory arbitration clause 
for the purpose of this agreement,claim means any assertion of a right,dispute or controversy between you and us arising from or relating to this agreement the relationship resulting from this agreement.claim includes claims of every kind and nature including,but not limited to,initial claims,counterclaims,and claims and claims based upon contract,tort,intentional tort,statutes,regulations,common law and equity.we shall not elect to use arbitration under this arbitration provision for any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court of your state or municipality so long as the claim is pending only in that court.
any claim shall be resolved upon the election by you or us,by arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision and the code of procedure of the national arbitration organization to which the claim is referred in effect at the time the claim is filed.claims shall be referred to the national arbitration forum naf,jams,or the american arbitration association aaa,as selected by the party electing to use arbitration.if a selection by us of one of these organizations is unacceptable to you,you shall have the right within thirty days after you receive notice of our election to select one of the other organizations listed to serve as arbitrator administrator.
at the heart of the instant appeal is the following provision contained in the agreement 
if arbitration is chosen by any party with respect to a claim,neither you nor we will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim further,you will not have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class of claimants pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration.the arbitrator decision will be final and binding.note that other rights that you would have if you went to court may also not be available in arbitration.
there shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public,other establishments which accept the card service establishments,or other persons or entities similarly situated.furthermore,claims brought by or against a service establishment may not be joined or consolidated in the arbitration with claims brought by or against any other service establishment s,unless otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties.
the card acceptance agreement thus not only precludes a merchant from bringing a class action lawsuit,it also precludes the signatory from having any claim arbitrated on anything other than an individual basis.
e.the district court decision.amex moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the terms of the card acceptance agreement.in its march,opinion,the district court granted amex motion,first holding that the arbitration clause in the agreement was a paradigmatically broad clause which was certainly applicable to the dispute between the parties.in re am.express merchs,wl,at.the district court also held that t he enforceability of the collective action waivers is a claim for the arbitrator to resolve.issues relating to the enforceability of the contract and its specific provisions are for the arbitrator,once arbitrability is established.id.at.thus,the district court concluded that all of the plaintiffs substantive antitrust claims,as well the question of whether or not the class action waivers were enforceable,were subject to arbitration.having so decided,the district court dismissed plaintiffs cases against amex.id.at.
f.our original decision,in re american express merchants litigation,cir.
the plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.we first decided that the issue of the class action waiver enforceability was a matter for the court,not the arbitrator.id.at.neither party takes issue with that holding,which we find survives.
we then turned to the question of whether the class action waiver in the card acceptance agreement was enforceable.we found that green tree financial randolph,controlled our analysis 
to the extent that it holds that when a party seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive,that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.at.we find that the district court erred in ruling that the plaintiffs had failed to bear this burden because they had ignore d the statutory protections provided by the clayton act.in re american express merchants litigation,wl,at.on the contrary,the record abundantly supports the plaintiffs argument that they would incur prohibitive costs if compelled to arbitrate under the class action waiver.the card acceptance agreement therefore entails more than a speculative risk that enforcement of the ban will deprive them of substantive rights under the federal antitrust statutes.
in re am.express,at.based in part on plaintiffs submission of an affidavit from an economist detailing the fiscal impracticality of pursuing individual claims,we concluded that 
amex has brought no serious challenge to the plaintiffs demonstration that their claims can not reasonably be pursued as individual actions,whether in federal court or in arbitration,we find ourselves in agreement with the plaintiffs contention that enforcement of the class action waiver in the card acceptance agreement flatly ensures that no small merchant may challenge american express tying arrangements under the federal antitrust laws.the effective negation of a private suit under the antitrust laws is troubling because such private suits provide a significant supplement to the limited resources available to the department of justice for enforcing the antitrust laws and deterring violations.reiter sonotone,d.
id.at.thus,we held that 
the class action waiver in the card acceptance agreement can not be enforced in this case because to do so would grant amex de facto immunity from antitrust liability by removing the plaintiffs only reasonably feasible means of recovery.as already set forth,section of the federal arbitration act,provides that an agreement to arbitrate shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.given that we believe that a valid ground exists for the revocation of the class action waiver,it can not be enforced under the faa.
id.at.amex timely filed a petition for certiorari.am.exp.italian colors restaurant.the supreme court granted amex petition,vacated our original decision,and remanded for further consideration in light of its holding in.the parties submitted supplemental briefing,and we find no need for further oral argument.
as this case was returned to us to consider the applicability of,that is where we begin.in,petitioners were shipping companies.at.shipping company customers,including animalfeeds international,ship their goods pursuant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a charter party.id.there are n umerous charter parties in use and charterers like animalfeeds,or their the select the charter party that governs their shipments.id.at.animalfeeds shipped its goods pursuant to a charter party that provided in relevant part 
arbitration.any dispute arising from the making,performance or termination of this charter party shall be settled in new york,owner and charterer each appointing an arbitrator,who shall be a merchant,broker or individual experienced in the shipping business the two thus chosen,if they can not agree,shall nominate a third arbitrator who shall be an admiralty lawyer.such arbitration shall be conducted in conformity with the provisions and procedures of the united states arbitration act,the faa,and a judgment of the court shall be entered upon any award made by said arbitrator.

animalfeeds,along with other charterers,sued,alleging illegal price fixing.as a result of various court decisions,animalfeeds and were required to arbitrate their antitrust dispute.id.animalfeeds served a demand for class arbitration.id.the parties agreed to have an arbitration panel decide the threshold issue of whether the charter party permitted class arbitration,and stipulated before the panel that the arbitration clause was silent on the issue of class arbitration.id.at.the arbitration panel heard evidence and argument,including testimony from experts regarding arbitration customs and usage in the maritime trade.id.at.the panel concluded that the expert testimony offered did not demonstrate an inten t to preclude class arbitration.id.bracket in original.after finding that the issue was controlled by the supreme court decision in green tree fin.bazzle,the panel concluded bazzle and policy considerations dictated finding the clause permitted class arbitration.id.
sought to vacate the arbitration award in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.sa animalfeeds int l,d.the district court found the arbitration panel decision was made in manifest disregard of the law.the district court found bazzle controlling only to the extent that the decision about class arbitrability was one for the arbitration panel to decide,and that bazzle did not speak to the issue of whether the clause permitted class arbitration.id.at.the district court also found that if the panel had undertaken a meaningful choice of law analysis,it would have concluded that maritime and new york state law applied.id.at.the court then concluded that the clause precluded class arbitration.id.at.
on appeal,our court reversed.sa animalfeeds int l,cir.noting that at oral argument counsel for conceded that the issue was one of first impression,we concluded that the relevant maritime and state law was inconclusive on the issue.id.at.in the absence of a clear maritime or state rule on the issue,we found that the arbitration panel could not have been in manifest disregard of the law.
the supreme court reversed.at.the court found that the arbitration panel imposed its own policy choice,rather than identifying and applying a rule of decision derived from the faa or either maritime or new york law,and thus exceeded its powers.id.at.tackling the issue itself,the court found the faa controlling,id.at,and reaffirmed that arbitration is simply a matter of contract between the parties.id.at emphasis and brackets omitted.the court continued 
it falls to courts and arbitrators to give effect to these contractual limitations,and when doing so,courts and arbitrators must not lose sight of the purpose of the exercise to give effect to the intent of the parties.
id.at.applying those principles to the case before it,the court concluded that a party may not be compelled under the faa to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.id.at emphasis in the original.amex urges that our decision can not stand in the wake of,reading the decision as repeatedly emphasiz ing courts obligation to faithfully enforce not just construe the parties arbitration agreement.amex.supp.reply br.at amex argues that 
holding that courts may not impose class arbitration on unwilling parties can not be reconciled with appellants contention that courts can invalidate the parties agreement based on the absence of class procedures.
amex supp.reply br.at we disagree.states that parties can not be forced to engage in a class arbitration absent a contractual agreement to do so.it does not follow,as amex urges,that a contractual clause barring class arbitration is per se enforceable.indeed,our prior holding focused not on whether the plaintiffs contract provides for class arbitration,but on whether the class action waiver is enforceable when it would effectively strip plaintiffs of their ability to prosecute alleged antitrust violations.
section of the faa,provides that an agreement to arbitrate shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.as the primary substantive provision,section create s a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the faa.moses cone memorial hosp.mercury constr.in our previous opinion,we jointed other circuits that evaluate the enforceability of the class action waivers under the federal substantive law of arbitrability.see gay creditinform,cir holding class action waiver to be enforceable under section of the faa notwithstanding claim that waiver was unconscionable under state law kristian comcast,cir although plaintiffs challenges to the enforceability of the arbitration agreements could be evaluated through the prism of state unconscionability law,we have chosen to apply a vindication of statutory rights analysis,which is also part of the body of federal substantive law of arbitration.
class action lawsuits are by the supreme court as a vehicle for vindicating statutory rights.this is especially true with respect to the court recognition that the class action device is the only economically rational alternative when a large group of individuals or entities has suffered an alleged wrong,but the damages due to any single individual or entity are too small to justify bringing an individual action.the court made the point forcefully more than thirty years ago in the context of an antitrust action 
a critical fact in this litigation is that petitioner individual stake in the damages award he seeks is only.no competent attorney would undertake this complex antitrust action to recover so inconsequential an amount.economic reality dictates that petitioner suit proceed as a class action or not at all.
eisen carlisle jacquelin.thus,as the court later opined,t he policy at the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.amchem,windsor,quoting mace van ru credit,cir see also deposit guar.bank roper,a class action may motivate plaintiffs to bring cases that for economic reasons might not be brought otherwise,thereby vindicating the rights of individuals who otherwise might not consider it worth the candle to embark on litigation in which the optimum result might be more than consumed by the cost.carnegie household int l,cir t he realistic alternative to a class action is not million individual suits,but zero individual suits,as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for.emphasis omitted.
the court addressed the use of class actions as a vehicle for vindicating statutory rights in gilmer lane.gilmer involved a claim under the age discrimination in employment act adea,et.specifically,the plaintiff,a manager at a brokerage firm,asserted that he had been terminated by the firm in violation of the adea.id.at.after the plaintiff had filed suit in federal district court,the defendant firm moved to compel arbitration pursuant to a mandatory arbitration provision contained in the rules of the new york stock exchange nyse,to which the plaintiff had agreed to be bound when he became a registered securities representative.id.at.the gilmer court held that because i t is by now clear that statutory claims may be the subject of an arbitration agreement,the arbitration clause was enforceable unless congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.id.at quoting mitsubishi motors soler.even though the court acknowledged that the adea is designed not only to address individual grievances,but also to further important social policies,id.at,it discerned no congressional intent to preclude adea claims from being subject to arbitration.the court also considered the plaintiff argument to the effect that arbitration procedures can not adequately further the purposes of the adea because they do not provide for broad equitable relief and class actions.id.at.the court rejected this contention,finding that 
arbitrators do have the power to fashion equitable relief.indeed,the nyse rules applicable here do not restrict the types of relief an arbitrator may award,but merely refer to damages other relief.the nyse rules also provide for collective proceedings.but even if the arbitration could not go forward as a class action or class relief could not be granted by the arbitrator,the fact that the adea provides for the possibility of bringing a collective action does not mean that individual attempts at conciliation were intended to be barred.
id.citations,internal quotation marks,and brackets omitted.
the third circuit,among others,relied on the final sentence of this passage to uphold a mandatory arbitration clause.johnson suburban bank,cir,dealt with a claim under the truth in lending act tila,et.the plaintiffs argued that their class action claim in federal court was not subject to mandatory arbitration because tila 
effectively create s an unwaivable right to bring a class action in tila,congress enacted a scheme in which the court hearing a class action could set a damage figure up to a certain amount for certain patterns of conduct.this judicial flexibility in imposing damages up to only exists if a class action is allowed,as individual plaintiff claims are generally capped at.therefore,a right of classes to a judicially crafted punitive remedy is lost if this court orders arbitration of johnson claims.
the third circuit held that t his argument is unavailing in light of gilmer.id.the court noted that gilmer involved a claim under the adea,a statute which explicitly provides in its text for the bringing of class actions.id.citing b.in spite of this,the court concluded,the supreme court still ruled that the adea did not preclude arbitration notwithstanding the unavailability of the class action remedy there.see also carter countrywide credit,cir w e reject the plaintiffs claim that their inability to proceed collectively in arbitration deprives them of substantive rights available under the fair labor standards act.the supreme court rejected similar arguments concerning the adea in gilmer.
we can not agree with this view of gilmer because a collective and perhaps a class action remedy was,in fact,available in that case.as set forth above,the supreme court explicitly noted that the arbitration rules of the nyse provided for the conduct of collective arbitration.gilmer,at.at the time gilmer was decided,the nyse rules may also have permitted arbitration claims submitted as class actions.compare nyse rule d a claim submitted as a class action shall not be eligible for arbitration under the rules of the exchange.with nyse rule d containing no prohibition on class actions.the statement in gilmer that the arbitration clause would be enforceable even if class remedies were available evidences that the court itself was uncertain,but acknowledged the probability,that class actions were feasible under the nyse rules.moreover,it is dicta that does not apply here.the plaintiffs do not proffer the argument rejected in gilmer,namely that the class action waiver is unenforceable merely because the relevant statute allows class actions.rather,the conundrum presented by the instant appeal is more nuanced whether the mandatory class action waiver in the card acceptance agreement is enforceable even if the plaintiffs are able to demonstrate that the practical effect of enforcement of the waiver would be to preclude their bringing sherman act claims against amex in either an individual or collective capacity.
green tree financial randolph also involved the enforcement of a statutory right,this time under the tila.the specific issue to be decided was whether an arbitration agreement that does not mention arbitration costs and fees is unenforceable because it fails to affirmatively protect a party from potentially steep arbitration costs.randolph,at.the plaintiff argued that the arbitration agreement silence with respect to costs and fees creates a risk that she will be required to bear prohibitive arbitration costs if she pursues her claims in an arbitral forum,and thereby forces her to forgo any claims she may have had against the defendants.id.at.the supreme court rejected this argument because the plaintiff had proved no more than that the asserted risk was hypothetical 
it may well be that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant such as randolph from effectively vindicating her feder
