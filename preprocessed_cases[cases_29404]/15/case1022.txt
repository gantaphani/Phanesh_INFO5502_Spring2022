plaintiff american products co,apc appeals after summary judgment was granted in favor of defendants law offices of geller,stewart foley,and michael geller collectively referred to as the geller defendants in apc action for intentional interference with prospective economic relationship and violating business and professions code section.the principal issue on appeal is the extent of the litigation privilege in civil code section,subdivision b section b as it applies to the geller defendants demand letters to some of apc customers prior to the filing or initiation of a lawsuit.
procedural background and facts 
apc is a manufacturer of automotive accessories.its accessories include accessory lighting kits for vehicles,such as specialty parking light kits and specialty exhaust tip lights.apc products are sold in automotive parts and accessory stores,such as the pep,moe jack of california pep boys and csk auto,doing business as kragen auto parts kragen.
on september,the geller defendants wrote to pep boys and identified their client as michael freeman freeman.the letter stated that freeman recently purchased a blue lights accessory kit from a pep boys store,that such lights were illegal,and that freeman only found out that they were illegal upon arriving home with the kit.the letter alleged that pep boys sale of this product constitutes unfair business practices within the meaning of business and professions code section and violates the consumer legal remedies act,et.the letter demanded that pep boys stop selling the lights,post notices in all their stores about the illegal products with an offer for full refund,pay to freeman,and pay to the geller defendants.
on january,the geller defendants wrote to kragen on behalf of freeman.this time freeman had purchased an exhaust tip led.the letter was substantially similar to the letter sent to pep boys in september.again,the geller defendants claimed that an illegal product had been sold to freeman and that freeman had only found out that the product was illegal upon arriving home.again,the geller defendants asserted violations of business and professions code section and civil code section et.the same demands made of pep boys were made to kragen.
on january,freeman filed a complaint against pep boys alleging violations of business and professions code section.he was represented by the geller defendants.on april,an almost identical action was filed by freeman against kragen.again,he was represented by the geller defendants.because of the lawsuits,pep boys and kragen informed apc that they would stop selling the accessories which could not be used legally on california roads and would be returning the ones they had on stock.
upon receiving the news from pep boys and kragen,apc initiated this action against the geller defendants.the first amended complaint alleges a violation of business and professions code section,interference with a contractual relationship,and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.apc claimed that the geller defendants have sent other california businesses demand letters wherein they alleged that the businesses had violated our state unfair competition and consumer protection statutes without a good faith basis.apc further claimed that the geller defendants have initiated lawsuits,based on these demand letters,against the same businesses without a good faith basis.on august,the geller defendants filed their general denial and asserted a number of affirmative defenses.
on january,the geller defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that their letters to pep boys and kragen were absolutely protected by the litigation privilege of section b.although apc filed its opposition and the geller defendants filed their reply,hearing on the motion was continued several times to allow apc to conduct discovery.
after conducting further discovery,apc requested the trial court to take judicial notice of matters in which freeman or geller were named plaintiffs.see appendix a to this opinion.freeman acknowledged that he has been a plaintiff in some to other lawsuits.he estimated that he has been a plaintiff in roughly lawsuits over the last years in which the geller defendants have represented him.
other evidence offered by apc shows that freeman was an attorney who was found guilty of seven counts of bankruptcy fraud in.he resigned from the state bar on april,with charges pending.in,he was employed by the geller defendants as a paralegal.regarding this case,freeman stated that at the end of august,he purchased some blue lights from pep boys in moreno valley because he had previously purchased similar items from another auto parts store with respect to one of the two lawsuits,he purchased a lighting product that he suspected might be unlawful to install on a car,but he wanted to confirm.and in the next lawsuit he purchased it to see if that product was also unlawful to install on the car.so with respect to both of them he had a suspicion that they were not lawful to be installed.but he did learn that it was indeed until he later consulted with geller.richard stewart,a named partner in the geller defendants law firm is a riverside county sheriff reserve deputy who has issued citations to motorists for using the same automotive lighting accessory kits that are the subject of freeman actions against pep boys and kragen.
the demand letters sent prior to initiation of the actions against pep boys and kragen claimed that the products are not allowed on any private passenger car ever if freeman had put the products on his car,then he could have been severely fined and stopped by the police or highway patrol for no other reason than he installed the products,which pep boys and kragen sell in their california stores.additionally,the letters claimed that even if there were a warning,we still believe that it would be illegal,there was no warning of any kind associated with these products.the letters stated the geller defendants belief that the sale of these parts is illegal.the letters informed pep boys and kragen that r emedies under the consumers legal remedies act include,but are not limited to,injunctive relief,restitution,actual damages,punitive damages and full attorneys fees.the geller defendants office currently charges per hour for consumer law.the consumers legal remedies act requires that the geller defendants give pep boys and kragen days notice prior to filing suit.this letter constitutes the geller defendants days notice.if their demands are not met within the next days,a class action suit may be filed without further notice to you.the geller defendants will seek disgorgement for all sales made of such illegal products as well as damages for anyone that actually purchased them.
the geller defendants demanded pep boys and kragen to immediately stop selling the products that have no legitimate purpose and are illegal to use on the street post notice in all california stores informing purchasers about the illegal products and offering them full refunds pay freeman for his time,trouble and effort and pay the geller defendants a sum to be negotiated,to include all the necessary agreements,but in the approximate sum of if suit is not brought.
in its supplemental opposition,apc claimed the litigation privilege does not apply to communications and statements made which are not in the furtherance of the objects of litigation.in support of its claim,apc argued that the geller defendants sent demand letters which,as part of their content,contained the statement that the subject products as manufactured by apc were illegal.however,t he subsequent litigation filed on behalf of freeman did not allege,nor did it contend,that apc products were illegal.moreover,the testimony of geller reflects that his opinion as to the legality of the products produced by apc was formed prior to the time that the subject letters were sent as such,the statement with respect to the alleged illegality of the apc products were sic not made in conjunction with a legitimate basis of subsequently pursued litigation.
in an order filed on december,the trial court found that the litigation privilege applies and granted summary judgment in favor of the geller defendants.the court stated apc argued that the purchase of its products was not a legitimate transaction involving an unsuspecting consumer,but was instead a transaction designed to extort funds.however,this premise was not supported by the evidence offered by apc.there were no facts to support this conclusion.instead,the facts,to which apc failed to cite,actually supported the conclusion that at the time the prelitigation demand letters were sent,a judicial proceeding would be contemplated if the letters did not result in a resolution.furthermore,the law,even as cited by apc,clearly states that neither sic intent,motive,morals or ethics constitute a bar to the application of the litigation privilege provided by civil code.
apc also argued that the underlying lawsuits did not claim that the subject products were illegal.accordingly,apc claimed that the prelitigation demand letters had no relation to a proceeding contemplated in good faith.however,the facts did not support this argument,nor is there any law to support this argument as well.in fact,contrary to apc assertion,both of the underlying lawsuits repeatedly referenced the illegality of apc products.
in short,the court found that such opposing evidence failed to raise a triable issue of material fact because the litigation privilege provided by civil code applied to the geller d efendants demand letters notwithstanding apc opposing evidence.specifically,the court held that the demand letters were sent in good faith since a serious contemplation of litigation existed at the time the letters were sent.the court further held that apc failed to provide any evidence to the contrary,either through direct testimony or statistical evidence.apc appeals.
standard of review 
our supreme court has described the purpose of the law of summary judgment to be a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.citation.under summary judgment law,any party to an action,whether plaintiff or defendant,may move the court for summary judgment in his favor on a cause of action,claim or defense citation a plaintiff contend ing that there is no defense to the action,a defendant contend ing that the action has no merit citation.the court must grant the motion if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact citation that is,there is no issue requiring a trial as to any fact that is necessary under the pleadings and,ultimately,the law citations and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law citation.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,internal quotation marks omitted.

the litigation privilege 
the litigation privilege protects a publication or broadcast b in any judicial proceeding citation.the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and to have some connection or logical relation to the action.citations.citations.
it has long been the law that communications that bear some relation to an anticipated lawsuit fall within the privilege.citations.the privilege has been broadly applied to demand letters and other prelitigation communications by attorneys.citations.
a prelitigation statement is protected by the litigation privilege of section b when the statement is made in connection with a proposed litigation that is contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.citation.citations.citations.t he good faith,serious consideration of litigation test is not a test for malice and it is not a variation of the interest of justice test.citation.rather,it is addressed to the requirement the statements have some connection or logical relation to the action.citations.citation.thus,if the statement is made with a good faith belief in a legally viable claim and in serious contemplation of litigation,then the statement is sufficiently connected to litigation and will be protected by the litigation privilege.citation.if it applies,the privilege is absolute.citation.blanchard directv,th,d.
apc contends the trial court erred in finding the litigation privilege applies here because there is a triable issue about whether the geller defendants sent the demand letters with the good faith belief in a legally viable claim and in serious contemplation of litigation.blanchard directv,supra,th,d,internal quotation marks omitted.it argues that the employment of the litigation process solely for purposes of creating income in the form of attorney fees is not a legitimate litigation objective.moreover,apc contends that the litigation privilege does not preclude actions by third parties for unfair business practices.rubin green cal th,d,kashian harriman th,d.because we agree with apc last contention,we need not address its first.
as our colleagues in the fifth district observed,when faced with a situation like that presented by the facts in this case,the litigation privilege does not apply.kashian harriman,supra,th,d.in kashian,plaintiff,chairman of the board of trustees of community hospitals of central california community,initiated an action against an attorney harriman and an environmental interest group for unfair business practices and defamatory statements.the controversy arose when community planned to build and operate a heart hospital in partnership with a group of local physicians.id.at,d.concerned groups,including harriman and his clients,wrote letters to the attorney general office requesting an investigation into unfair business practices and a possible conflict of interest between kashian private business interests and his role as chairman of the community board.id.at,d.the local newspaper published a news article reporting on harriman letter,focusing on the accusations about kashian.kashian was quoted as saying the accusations were completely false.id.at,d.harriman reportedly refused to comment on the letter ibid.
in response to the lawsuit,harriman filed a motion to strike the complaint on the grounds that,among other things,both his environmental litigation activities and his letter to the attorney general were absolutely privileged under section b.kashian harriman,supra,th,d.the trial court agreed and kashian appealed.on appeal,the fifth district offered the following discussion 
california law recognizes two types of privileged which are absolutely privileged and communications which are qualifiedly or conditionally privileged.if absolutely privileged,there is no liability even if the defamatory communication is made with actual malice.if the privilege is only conditional or qualified,a finding of malice will prevent the communication from being found privileged.citations.
civil code section,subdivision b defines what is commonly known as the litigation privilege.the usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action.citation.
the litigation privilege is absolute it applies,if at all,regardless whether the communication was made with malice or the intent to harm.citation.put another way,application of the privilege does not depend on the publisher motives,morals,ethics or intent.citation.although originally applied only to defamation actions,the privilege has been extended to any communication,not just a publication,having some relation to a judicial proceeding,and to all torts other than malicious prosecution.citations.moreover,t he litigation
