defendants cross country bank bank,its credit card servicing company applied card systems,acs,and rocco abessinio appeal from an order denying their motion to compel arbitration most of the issues originally raised on appeal have been settled by our supreme court recent decision in discover bank superior court cal th,d,discover bank.consequently,the principal issue remaining for decision is the proper application of the choice of law rules outlined in nedlloyd lines superior court cal th,d,nedlloyd.we conclude that the trial court correctly applied the appropriate choice of law analysis that under california law the hidden waiver of the right to bring classwide arbitration in this case is unconscionable and therefore,the arbitration clause is unenforceable.
background 
california residents,dana klussman and samantha klussman filed a class action complaint for damages and injunctive relief alleging five causes of action against bank,acs and abessinio.the operative complaint for purposes of this appeal is the fourth amended complaint filed on may,bank is a delaware corporation headquartered in delaware that issues visa and mastercard credit cards and solicits a substantial amount of business in california.acs is a delaware corporation headquartered in florida that services bank credit card operations and collects related debts.abessinio is the owner and chief executive officer of bank and acs.
the complaint alleged that bank california customers were primarily low credit individuals including elderly and disabled persons who had experienced bankruptcies or had other credit management problems,and who were generally unsophisticated and vulnerable to financial predation.the complaint alleged that bank has earned hundreds of millions of dollars by offering credit cards to these consumers and subsequently engaged in a pattern of unlawful practices such as misrepresenting payoff charges,imposing unauthorized fees,charging late fees for timely payments,automatically subscribing customers to unauthorized and costly programs and using abusive and harassing tactics in collecting fees and charges.
the first cause of action alleged violations of the california consumers legal remedies act clra,et the second cause of action alleged violations of the delaware unfair business practices act.the third cause of action alleged breach of contract in that defendants failed to honor payoff agreements and promises of free credit increases.the fourth cause of action alleged fraud and imposition of excessive bank fees.the fifth cause of action alleged violations of the california unfair competition law ucl.bus,et the complaint requested damages,restitution,interest,an injunction and attorney fees.
the relevant cardholder agreements stated that delaware law governed except where federal law applied.the visa and mastercard cardholder agreements issued to dana klussman in contained a paragraph regarding arbitration that stated you and we agree that all claims,demands,or disputes that you may have against us or that we may have against you,which in any way relate to or arise out of this agreement,your account,or your use or attempted use of the card,or the servicing of your account by applied card systems,or this agreement to arbitrate,as well as involving claims of fraud or misrepresentation,shall be brought in arbitration before the national arbitration forum naf.the paragraph concluded with the statement that rules and forms of the naf may be obtained by calling and all claims shall be filed at any naf office,on the world wide web at www.arb forum.com or at box,minneapolis,minnesota.this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce.
in june of,bank issued dana klussman new cards and a new agreement.the agreement added language stating that the arbitration agreement shall be governed by the federal arbitration act,faa.you and we waive the right to a jury trial.samantha klussman was issued a visa card in with an agreement that was similar to dana klussman agreement.
on june,bank,acs and abessinio filed a motion to compel arbitration defendants based the motion on the contentions that the claims were governed by the faa,that they fell within the scope of the arbitration clauses and that the defendants had not waived the right to compel arbitration.
plaintiffs opposed the motion,first arguing that the clra and ucl claims for injunctive relief are not subject to arbitration under broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d,broughton and cruz pacificare health systems,cal th,d,cruz.noting that the clra expressly authorizes class actions,plaintiffs contended that to the extent enforcement of the arbitration clause would preclude class actions,enforcement was prohibited under america online,superior court th,d aol.plaintiffs explained that although the arbitration clause at issue did not mention class actions,it was the functional equivalent of a waiver because the rules of naf,the designated arbitrator,prohibit classwide arbitration unless all parties consent.the only way a consumer could discover this fact would be to obtain,read and understand the meaning of the lengthy naf rules applying california choice of law rules,plaintiffs argued that california law governed and would prohibit enforcement of the class action waiver as unconscionable.
the superior court agreed with plaintiffs that the clra and ucl claims for injunctive relief were not subject to arbitration under broughton,supra,cal th,d,and cruz,supra,cal th,d.the court then applied the faa and california law in a choice of law analysis pursuant to nedlloyd,supra,cal th,d,and concluded that the arbitration clause was unenforceable because the naf restriction on class actions could not be severed.the court denied the motion to compel arbitration defendants promptly appealed.
discussion 
on appeal,defendants argue that a proper application of the choice of law rules mandates a finding that delaware law governs and delaware courts enforce class action waivers.
after defendants filed their opening brief,our supreme court decided discover bank,holding that a waiver of classwide arbitration in a consumer contract of adhesion was unconscionable in the circumstances of that case,and that the faa does not preempt california invalidation of such waivers.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiffs commented on the discover bank case in their brief and defendants addressed the case in their reply brief.after reviewing the arguments of the parties and the relevant authorities,we conclude that the pertinent arbitration clauses are unenforceable under california law.
the clra and ucl claims for injunctive relief 
initially,we note that in broughton and cruz,our supreme court held that claims for injunctive relief under the clra broughton and ucl cruz are intended to remedy public wrongs and further the public interest and are not subject to arbitration in both cases,the court rejected the claim that federal law was inconsistent with the decisions.broughton,supra,cal th at,d,cruz,supra,cal th at,d.under the authority of auto equity sales,superior court cal d,auto equity,we must follow the holdings of those cases that injunctive relief claims under the clra and ucl are not subject to arbitration.
faa preemption 
defendants initially argued that the trial court erred when it failed to apply federal law,which preempts any applicable state law.the arbitration clause in the credit card agreements provides that the clause concerns a transaction involving commerce.the clause expressly states that it is governed by the faa.the faa provides a written provision in any contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
the court in discover bank,supra,cal th,d,responded to the argument that the faa preempts california law concerning class action waivers in arbitration agreements.the court determined that the faa is silent on the issue of class action arbitration and that any conclusion regarding federal law must be based on the decisions of the united states supreme court.discover bank,supra,at,d.the court concluded that federal law,in particular green tree financial bazzle,d,does not prohibit courts from deciding certain gateway matters concerning arbitration and that under california law,courts decide the issue of whether grounds exist for revocation of the arbitration agreement.under california law,the question whether grounds exist for the revocation of the arbitration agreement based on grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract citation is for the courts to decide,not an arbitrator.discover bank,supra,at,d.
discover bank establishes that the faa does not preempt a court from ruling on initial matters of state law regarding contractual grounds for revoking an arbitration agreement.in light of discover bank,we consider whether to apply california or delaware law when evaluating the waiver in this case.
choice of analysis 
the choice of law provision in the agreements in this case provides that they are governed by delaware law except where federal law applies.the parties agree that the analysis in nedlloyd,supra,cal th,d,is the applicable test to determine the law that governs the contract at issue.the court in nedlloyd reaffirmed the applicability of section of the restatement second of conflict of laws restatement 
assuming that the claims at issue are within the scope of the choice of law clause,we follow the analysis set out by the court in nedlloyd briefly restated,the proper approach under restatement section,subdivision is for the court first to determine either whether the chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction,or whether there is any other reasonable basis for the parties choice of law.if neither of these tests is met,that is the end of the inquiry,and the court need not enforce the parties choice of law.if,however,either test is met,the court must next determine whether the chosen state law is contrary to a fundamental policy of california.if there is no such conflict,the court shall enforce the parties choice of law.if,however,there is a fundamental conflict with california law,the court must then determine whether california has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue,subd.if california has a materially greater interest than the chosen state,the choice of law shall not be enforced,for the obvious reason that in such circumstance we will decline to enforce a law contrary to this state fundamental policy.nedlloyd,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.
substantial relationship of chosen state 
delaware has a substantial relationship to the defendants in this case.it is the state where bank is incorporated and headquartered and the state of incorporation of acs.nedlloyd,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiffs do not dispute this finding,but only argue that delaware interest does not outweigh that of california.we next consider whether the law of the chosen state conflicts with that of california.
delaware law on class action waivers 
in general,delaware recognizes the concept of unconscionability in commercial transactions.see,architectural cabinets,gaster finding confession of judgment clause unconscionable where not clearly stated in agreement.the supreme court of delaware would refuse to enforce a provision in an agreement that it determined was unconscionable.worldwide ins.group klopp,court refused to enforce insurance policy provision limiting ability to demand trial de novo to cases where award exceeded state financial responsibility law.
nevertheless,delaware would not invalidate an arbitration clause merely because it prohibited class actions.we took judicial notice of the amicus curiae brief filed in discover bank by bank counsel,who then represented the delaware state bank commissioner.the commissioner argued that delaware routinely enforces class action waivers in arbitration agreements and cited a number of unpublished opinions that supported his contention.
in a published decision,a delaware superior court determined that an express waiver in an arbitration agreement of the ability to bring a class action is not unconscionable.edelist mbna america bank,edelist.the agreement at issue in edelist stated no claim may be brought as a class action or as a private attorney general.you will not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any c laim.id.at.applying delaware law,the superior court declined to find the clause unconscionable in light of the clearly articulated statement waiving class actions.id.at see also johnson west suburban bank cir,johnson claims under federal statutes can be referred to arbitration,even though arbitration clause renders class actions unavailable.
for purposes of this analysis,we will assume that a delaware court would permit a class action waiver in an arbitration agreement.
california view of class action waivers implicates public policy 
we next review the relevant california law to decide if the law of delaware conflicts with and is contrary to a fundamental policy in california.nedlloyd,supra,cal th at,d.
the parties to this appeal do not dispute the existence of a conflict between delaware and california law on this issue.courts in california have not hesitated to invalidate class action waivers in the appropriate circumstances.the courts in aol,supra,th,d,szetela discover bank th,d szetela,and independent of mailbox center owners,superior court th,d mailbox center,have all invalidated class action waivers in arbitration agreements 
in discover bank,supra,cal th,d,our supreme court concluded that when a class action waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then,at least to the extent the obligation at issue is governed by california law,the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.under these circumstances,such waivers are unconscionable under california law and should not be enforced.discover bank,supra,at,d.
the clear conflict between the law of the two states requires an evaluation of whether this conflict implicates a fundamental public policy in california.we conclude that it does for the following reasons.
the court in discover bank cited the discussions in aol and szetela regarding unconscionability and public policy with approval.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.aol involved a choice of law and a forum selection clause in an internet company subscriber agreement.the chosen state did not allow consumer lawsuits to be brought as class actions.aol,supra,th at,d.the aol court explained that california courts will not defer to a choice of law clause where doing so would substantially diminish the rights of california residents in a way that violates our state public policy.aol,supra,at,d.the court relied on two sources of public policy in refusing to enforce the virginia choice of law clause the clra contains an express provision voiding any attempted waiver of rights under the clra as contrary to public policy,and enforcing the choice of law clause would violate an important public policy underlying california consumer protection law because virginia law prohibits consumer class action lawsuits and thereby diminishes the rights of consumers.aol,supra,at,d.
to explain the significance of class action consumer litigation in california,the aol court quoted from justice mosk opinion for a unanimous supreme court in vasquez superior court cal d,as follows protection of unwary consumers from being duped by unscrupulous sellers is an exigency of the utmost priority in contemporary society.frequently numerous consumers are exposed to the same dubious practice by the same seller so that proof of the prevalence of the practice as to one consumer would provide proof for all.individual actions by each of the defrauded consumers are often impracticable because the amount of individual recovery would be insufficient to justify bringing a separate action thus an unscrupulous seller retains the benefits of its wrongful conduct.a class action by consumers produces several salutary,including a therapeutic effect upon those sellers who indulge in fraudulent practices,aid to legitimate business enterprises by curtailing illegitimate competition,and avoidance to the judicial process of the burden of multiple litigation involving identical claims.the benefit to the parties and the courts would,in many circumstances,be substantial.aol,supra,th at,d.
because the chosen state law in aol was hostile to class actions,the aol court concluded the unavailability of class action relief in this context is sufficient in and by itself to preclude enforcement of the forum selection clause.aol,supra,th at,d.
szetela concerned a class action by a credit cardholder against a bank.because the parties had already engaged in arbitration,rather than refusing to enforce the arbitration agreement,the court issued a writ of mandate directing the trial court to strike the contractual provision prohibiting classwide arbitration.szetela,supra,th at,fn,d.the court discussed the procedural and substantive elements of unconscionability and concluded that the contract in question was presented on a take it or leave it basis without the opportunity for meaningful negotiation and was,therefore,procedurally unconscionable.id.at,d.
regarding substantive unconscionability,the court found the manifest of the no class action provision at issue here is blindingly obvious.szetela,supra,th at,d.the court noted that the provision was styled as a mutual prohibition,but credit card companies typically do not sue their customers in class action lawsuits.the court found it obvious that the purpose of the provision was to deter customers from seeking redress for small amounts of damages.id.at,d.the court concluded that the prohibition violated notions of fundamental fairness and public policy by allowing litigants to contract away a procedural mechanism that benefits the court system as a whole.id.at,d.
recently,in mailbox center,the fourth district court of appeal reversed a trial court decision that claims of franchisees against the franchisor must be arbitrated on an individual basis where classwide arbitration was prohibited by the rules of the designated arbitrator.mailbox center,supra,th at,d.the court determined that broad statutory arguments,implicating the public interest,are raised,where a class action waiver is imposed in an adhesion contract.the court ruled that the class prohibition was unconscionable.id.at,d.
each of the foregoing courts refused to enforce an unconscionable waiver provision on public policy grounds.in addition,discover bank mentioned the public policy against exculpatory waivers in civil code section as one that may be violated by class action waivers because the impact is to shield a company from liability for many small instances of exploitation discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.the court also cited armendariz,supra,cal th at pages,d,arbitration agreement can not serve to waive employee rights under the fair employment and housing act,which noted that civil code section,which prohibits contractual waiver of laws established for a public reason,expresses a public policy against waiver of such rights.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.
the right to seek classwide redress is more than a mere procedural device in california.contra,johnson,supra,at right to class action merely procedural.california courts assessing waivers of the right to seek classwide relief have relied on statutory expressions of public policy regarding unconscionable contracts and exculpatory waivers to invalidate the offending agreements.
nevertheless,defendants argue that the federal district court decision in arriaga cross country bank d arriaga upheld the same arbitration agreement that is at issue in this appeal and should be followed the court in arriaga based its decision on the belief that a court could not consider the issue of substantive unconscionability because it concerned the validity of the contract as a whole.id.at.the court also felt that burying the class action waiver within layers of the naf rules was not unconscionable because an individual should expect that agreeing to arbitration would involve a waiver of the ability to bring a class action.ibid.
we note that the district court decision in arriaga was criticized by the court of appeals in ting v.at t cir,fn.disapproving language stating that agreement was not,stating that there is no chance of at t filing class action against its customers,and ingle circuit city stores,cir,fn.rejecting language in arriaga to the effect that unilateral bar on classwide arbitration is not unconscionable.we agree with the criticism and decline to follow the analysis in arriaga.
defendants also suggest that this court follow the reasoning of justice baxter concurring and dissenting opinion in discover bank on the subject of unconscionability.as an intermediate appellate court,we do not have that option.auto equity,supra,cal d at.defendants also argue that the proper choice of law analysis was applied in an unpublished federal district court case,egerton citibank,et,feb,no.plax wl egerton.that court,applying south dakota law,concluded that the agreement at issue was not unconscionable because south dakota enacted a statute allowing credit card companies to add arbitration clauses to consumer agreements.egerton,supra,at.the egerton court never considered whether south dakota law was contrary to a fundamental policy in california.its analysis does not apply to this case.
defendants argue that discover bank did not hold that all class action waivers are unconscionable.they contend that garcia directv,th,d garcia,which predated discover bank,suggested that class action waivers do not violate any fundamental public policy.but the court in garcia merely mentioned,i n the absence of a class action waiver,california law authorizes class wide arbitrations garcia,supra,at,d.that court never suggested it was considering public policy,but merely referred the case for a determination of whether the silent agreement prohibited classwide arbitration.ibid.decisions are not authority for issues not considered or decided therein.fiol doellstedt th,fn,d.
although defendants are correct that the court in discover bank did not reject all class action waivers,it did denounce waivers such as the one in this case,where the amounts of damages are small,the adhesion contract concerns california consumers and the allegations allege the defendant has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.it confirmed the fundamental nature of the policy favoring class actions when it quoted from szetela,supra,th at page,d.by imposing this clause on its customers,discover has essentially granted itself a license to push the boundaries of good business practices to their furthest limits,fully aware that relatively few,if any,customers will seek legal remedies,and that any remedies obtained will only pertain to that single customer without collateral estoppel effect.the potential for millions of customers to be overcharged small amounts without an effective method of redress can not be ignored.therefore,the provision violates fundamental notions of fairness.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.
we find the reasoning of discover bank even more compelling in this case because the waiver in this case was not expressed in the agreement,the plaintiffs have pleaded causes of action under the clra and ucl that are statutes that seek to vindicate public rights,and plaintiffs seek to represent only california residents,not a nationwide class as was involved in discover bank the foregoing california cases and the reasoning of the discover bank court lea
