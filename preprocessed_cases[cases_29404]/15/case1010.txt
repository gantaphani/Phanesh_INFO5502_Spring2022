background 
sorensen filed her second amended complaint against defendants household finance corporation hfc,ars recovery services,and doe defendants access recovery services,collins financial services,collins,and experian served as does through,respectively.the second amended complaint alleged claims for negligence against hfc and collins,violation of the consumer credit reporting agencies act ccraa against experian,and unfair competition against all defendants.the claims were based on allegations that collection accounts were reported to experian regarding sorensen and approximately other debtors,and that the original delinquency dates for each of the reported collection accounts had been changed to a later date before being reported to experian,causing the collection accounts to be displayed on sorensen and others credit reports for a longer period of time than allowed by the ccraa.sorensen alleged experian violated the ccraa by providing inaccurate reports,causing actual damage to sorensen and others similarly situated.
in january,the trial court signed and filed a stipulated protective order the collins stipulated protective order which stated,whereas,collins purchased debt from hfc including plaintiff debt whereas,collins on august,sold a portion of the hfc debt to access recovery group,including plaintiff debt whereas,plaintiff contends that access recovery group and ace recovery services are in some manner related whereas,plaintiff contends in this litigation that she was damaged as a result of inaccurate information regarding her hfc debt that was supplied to various credit reporting agencies including defendant experian by ace recovery services,which caused the reporting period for plaintiff hfc debt to be improperly extended for two years whereas,plaintiff contends that the scope of her proposed class in this litigation consists of those who are similarly situated to her,to wit,those persons whose hfc debt was sold by collins to access recovery group on august,and whose hfc debt information was subsequently incorrectly reported to experian resulting in the reporting period for the hfc debt to be improperly extended whereas,plaintiff contends that she needs collins to provide in response to her discovery sufficient information regarding the hfc debt sold by collins to access recovery group in order that plaintiff can request experian through discovery to provide information regarding the hfc debt to determine if any of the persons whose hfc debt was sold by collins to access recovery group are similarly situated to her whereas,collins contends that the hfc debt information sought by plaintiff through discovery in this litigation is confidential and not otherwise subject to discovery by plaintiff at this point in this litigation plaintiff and collins hereby stipulate as follows collins agrees to provide the debtor name,hfc account number,debtor social security number,debt delinquency date and debt charge off date for the hfc debt sold by collins to access recovery group on august,and as reported to access recovery group by collins plaintiff agrees to maintain the confidentiality of this hfc debt information and further agrees that the only use that she will make of this hfc debt information will be to provide it to experian for purposes of conducting discovery in this litigation regarding the proposed class members.plaintiff and collins agree that plaintiff may not use the hfc debt information for any other purpose including,but not limited to,contacting any hfc debtors without prior leave of court following a noticed motion.italics added.
sorensen filed a motion for class certification.while sorensen motion was pending,collins and hfc were dismissed from the case through summary judgment.the trial court denied sorensen motion for class certification,stating in part,t his case is not appropriate for class treatment.the problems identifying the class members,the difference in the damages suffered,are too great to render class treatment the appropriate method of resolving this case.the class definition is not correctly stated.the definition urged in this motion is not the same as the definition set forth in the operative complaint.the definition does not reference specific dates to which the litigation applies.the common issues of fact law do not predominate over individual questions.
the trial court order further stated,p laintiff also runs into trouble with the damages aspect of the claims.it is impossible to tell how,if at all,any of the individual class members were damaged.the alleged inaccurate reporting may have resulted in denial of credit or a higher interest rate on a loan,but it impossible to tell.to do so would require an individual analysis of each class member credit history,report.because the common issues of fact and law do not predominate over the individual issues,class certification is not appropriate.
after her motion for class certification had been denied sorensen filed a motion seeking relief from the collins stipulated protective order.sorensen sought permission to use the names of debtors provided by collins under that order to mail a proposed letter to those debtors notifying them that they might have claims subject to running statutes of limitations and requesting each recipient consent to be contacted by sorensen counsel to determine whether he or she has evidence relating to the issue of sorensen damages.experian opposed the motion.
before the hearing on sorensen motion,the trial court issued a tentative ruling denying it.the tentative ruling stated in part,p laintiff may be able to send the letter without violation of the rules of professional conduct,but her alleged need for the information does not outweigh the individual right to privacy.the information was wil l fully provided by collins on the express condition the only use that she will make of this hfc debt information will be to provide it to experian for purposes of conducting discovery in this litigation regarding the proposed class members.if plaintiff made a request to contact some of the purported class members prior to her motion for certification,this court would have allowed the communication only through a neutral third party and would release the personal information only if the particular individual agreed to do so.
at the hearing,sorensen counsel suggested modifications to the proposed communication,including the use of a neutral third party.the trial court decided that some form of communication to other debtors should be allowed and ordered the parties to meet and confer on the form of such a proposed letter.by the continued hearing in october,the parties had failed to agree on the form of a proposed letter.the trial court reviewed a second letter proposed by sorensen counsel,and made additional revisions.
the revised proposed letter which was preliminarily approved by the trial court includes the date and neutral third party letterhead,stating,rosenthal company,llc re sorensen household finance box novato,ca.the letter states the following 
dear recipient 
you are receiving this letter because you may have been a member of a proposed class action against various defendants including experian credit bureau and ace recovery services,a collection agency.your legal deadline to bring a claim against these defendants may have been affected by a recent court ruling.
in may,mellonie sorensen filed a proposed class action against these and other defendants.business records showed that you may have been a member of the proposed class because 
you had a debt to household finance corporation in the early or mid.
the debt was sold to various entities and might or might not have been reported on your experian credit report by ace recovery services.
ace may have inaccurately reported the delinquency information about your debt.the result may have been that the information remained on your credit report longer than it should have.
on august,the orange county superior court denied plaintiff motion to certify a class.that means currently only sorensen can seek compensation in this lawsuit.the fact that you are receiving this notice does not mean that you have a claim or that you have been damaged.you should consult legal counsel with any questions you may have regarding your legal rights.
finally,even if you are not interested in pursuing this matter on behalf of yourself,sorensen is requesting that you allow her attorney to contact you to determine whether you possess evidence that could be of value in the prosecution of her lawsuit.if you are willing to provide this cooperation,please let the neutral know that.
the court has appointed rosenthal company as a neutral person you may contact for further information.their contact information is as follows

the sending of this letter has been approved by order of the orange county superior court.
experian counsel asked the trial court to stay entry of the order approving the letter for a time period sufficient to enable experian to consider its appellate options.the trial court agreed and set another status conference for final approval of the letter.
experian filed a petition for writ of mandate on october.we issued an order to show cause on november,scheduled additional briefing,and held oral argument.
discussion 
trial court erred by approving portions of the letter notifying nonparties of their potential legal rights.
at the hearing,the trial court stated,i t seems to me that we might be able to fashion some sort of notice that could be sent by a neutral that would put these people on notice that they may have a cause of action which the statute of limitations is running on,and if they wish to pursue it,they should.experian argues,a court has no authority to regulate or otherwise interject itself into matters outside the specific controversy before it.
the record is clear that the trial court did not interject itself,uninvited,into the parties dispute about the letter.the trial court did not order sua sponte,much less suggest,that such a communication be made.it was sorensen counsel who sought to send the letter and filed a noticed motion to obtain court approval to do so pursuant to the terms of the collins stipulated protective order.the issue whether the letter may be sent was squarely before the trial court.
sorensen had obtained the identities of the proposed recipients of the letter through a discovery request propounded on collins.collins provided that information within the context of the collins stipulated protective order prohibiting sorensen from using that information for any other purpose than as stated in that order unless she first filed a noticed motion and obtained court approval.after her motion for class certification was denied,sorensen sought to communicate with the former potential class members using information she had obtained through the discovery process to notify them that the court denied class certification and the statute of limitations on their claims is going to expire soon.
what is the legal basis for a communication alerting nonparties to potential claims against a party in her return to the petition,sorensen generally argues,a lthough experian tries to turn the table on sorensen and place the burden on sorensen to establish judicial authority allowing her to contact the other victims,sorensen already has a first amendment right to communicate with whomever she wishes.the united states supreme court in seattle times rhinehart,d,however,held,a litigant has no first amendment right of access to information made available only for purposes of trying his suit.
there is ample precedent for precertification communication by the plaintiff with potential class members.see,best buy stores,superior court th,d parris superior court th,d howard gunty profit sharing plan superior court th,d the plaintiffs are permitted precertification communication with potential class members for the purpose of investigation and preparation of their claims or defenses.this precertification discovery is based on the policy acknowledging the importance of class actions in california.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,c ourts long have acknowledged the importance of class actions as a means to prevent a failure of justice in our judicial system.
however,after a motion has been denied,the plaintiff represents himself or herself only,not putative class members.in daar yellow cab cal d,our supreme court recognized that an order disposing of class claims is tantamount to a dismissal of the action as to all members of the class other than plaintiff.thus,court approval of communications after a motion has been denied involves a different analysis than approval of precertification communications.
after a motion is denied,can a court order a plaintiff or a neutral third party to send a letter to former potential class members notifying them of possible claims against the defendant no.there is no legal basis to permit such a communication.
indeed,in woosley state of california cal th,d,the california supreme court rejected the plaintiff argument that if his class claim were disallowed,notice would have to be given to each putative class member that they were entitled to a refund of use taxes and license fees,and the time to file a claim for refund was running from the date of notice.the supreme court stated,w e disagree with plaintiff contention that such notice is required.whatever merit there may be in plaintiff argument that the time for putative class members to file claims has been tolled,we are unaware of any requirement that notice be given to persons affected by such tolling of the period in which to file a claim.the decision in american pipe construction utah.required only that persons who will be included in the class be notified so that they have an opportunity to opt out of the class and thus not be bound by the resulting judgment.neither the decision in american pipe,supra,d,nor any other authority of which we are aware,requires that persons who are outside the class be notified of that fact.ibid.
we recognize that with regard to the supreme court holding in woosley state of california,supra,cal th,d,there is a difference between not being required to send out a notice regarding possible claims and being prohibited from doing so.nevertheless,the supreme court rationale in woosley is consistent with our analysis there is no legal basis supporting notifications of possible rights to putative class members after a motion for class certification has been denied.
in litigation,it is not the court role to order notification to third parties of their possible legal claims.in our view,such a role is inconsistent with woosley state of california,supra,cal th,d,and draws the trial court impartiality into question.thus,after class certification has bee
