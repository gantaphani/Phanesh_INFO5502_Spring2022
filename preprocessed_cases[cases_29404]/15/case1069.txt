introduction 
in this appeal,four class members challenge the settlement of a class action complaint,which had been brought against a number of manufacturers of vitamin products.they contend that code of civil procedure section section bars the settlement because it does not allow the members of their class to make individual claims,instead awarding the entire settlement to charitable and organizations.we conclude that section does not bar the settlement in this case and,accordingly,affirm.
ii.factual and procedural background 
this appeal arises from a coordinated proceeding for numerous separate complaints brought on behalf of a class of a ll purchasers located in the state of california who indirectly purchased vitamins,vitamin premixes,other vitamin products from any of the defendants for use,but not for resale,at any time during the period january,to the late.the coordinated class complaint the class complaint alleged that defendants,manufacturers of raw vitamins,vitamin premixes,and other bulk vitamin products for bulk sales,committed in violation of both the cartwright act bus,et and the unfair competition law bus,et.
on october,the attorney general,acting on behalf of the people of the state of california,filed a complaint,which contained allegations similar to those in the class complaint.seven of the defendants named in the class complaint were also named in the attorney general complaint.on november,the trial court granted the people petition for coordination of its case as an case to the coordinated proceeding.
on august,the class representatives and the people collectively,plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement with the seven defendants named in the attorney general complaint basf corporation,daiichi pharmaceutical,eisai,aventis animal nutrition formerly rhone poulenc animal nutrition,roche,roche vitamins,and takeda chemical industries,collectively,settling defendants.the settlement agreement contemplated a payment of million for attorney fees and the certification of two classes for settlement purposes only.one class,described as the consumer settlement class consumer class,was to consist of a ll natural persons who purchased indirect vitamin products during the relevant period for use or consumption by themselves others and not for resale in any form,and who are residents of the state of california.in settlement of the claims of the consumer class,million was to be distributed to charitable,governmental and organizations that promote the health and nutrition of consumer class members or that otherwise further the purposes underlying the lawsuit.
the second class,described as the commercial settlement class commercial class,was to consist of certain purchasers of indirect vitamin products for resale,for incorporation into another product or products for resale,or for use in the manufacture,processing or development of another product including the feeding of an animal for resale the commercial class was to be paid up to million.
the motion explained that notice would be given to the class members by publication and attached a copy of the proposed notice.the notice explained that the consumer settlement amount,million minus costs and expenses,plus interest will be distributed,pursuant to a plan of distribution,to eligible organizations that collectively are,as nearly as practicable,representative of the interests of injured consumers the consumer settlement amount will not be paid to individual california consumers for the following four reasons a the impracticability of processing the potential claims of million individuals who purchased indirect vitamin products during the relevant period b the expense and inconvenience to individual class members associated with having to document specific purchases of indirect vitamin products over a span of more than ten years c the potential unfairness to class members who are unable to provide evidence of their purchases of indirect vitamin products during the relevant period and d the high cost of administering direct cash payments to millions of consumers relative to the average likely award to those consumers.the notice further explained the process by which class members could of the settlement.
on september,the trial court gave its preliminary approval of the proposed settlement,including its planned publication of notice.the court scheduled a hearing on final settlement approval for january.
on november,appellants,each an alleged member of the consumer class,filed a motion for intervention.they sought to object to the settlement of the consumer class claims on the ground that the settlement did not provide the members of the consumer class an opportunity to obtain their proportionate share of the proposed settlement prior to its allocation to cy pres relief.appellants further argued that representation of both the consumer and commercial classes by the same attorneys constituted a conflict of interest.on december,the trial court denied the motion for intervention,explaining in part that o n the existing record it has not been shown that class counsel have a prohibited conflict of interest in representing both the consumer class and the commercial class 
on december,appellants filed objections to the proposed consumer class settlement.on january,the trial court filed its final order approving consumer class settlement and final judgment and final order approving commercial class settlement and final judgment.with respect to the consumer class,the trial court found that the cy pres distribution of the consumer class settlement proceeds is proper because of the following three reasons it is impracticable or impossible to compensate direct victims of the alleged wrongdoing because of the disproportionate administrative expenses resulting from the number of potential claimants in relation to the size of the fund there is a strong correlation between the proposed use of the funds and the class benefited and the proposed relief furthers the purpose of the relevant statute.
iii.discussion 
a.the propriety of the cy pres remedy 
the settlement agreement contemplates distribution of the entire consumer class settlement to charitable,governmental and organizations.appellants refer to this remedy as a cy pres remedy.the doctrine of cy pres originated in the common law of charitable trusts where compliance with the literal terms of a charitable trust became impossible,the funds would be put to the next best use,in accord with the dominant charitable purposes of the donor.citation.state of california levi strauss cal d,levi strauss.in the context of a class action,the term fluid recovery is often used instead of the phrase cy pres remedy.see kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,kraus.the theory underlying fluid class recovery is that since each class member can not be compensated exactly for the damage he or she suffered,the best alternative is to pay damages in a way that benefits as many of the class members as possible and in the approximate proportion that each member has been damaged,even though,most probably,some injured class members will receive no compensation and some people not in the class will benefit from the distribution bruno superior court d.bruno.
appellants argue that section precludes a cy pres remedy or fluid recovery where the class members have not first been given an opportunity to obtain their appropriate share of the settlement.because this argument requires statutory interpretation,our review is de novo.see american nat.ins.low th,d.
pursuant to established principles,our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow f
