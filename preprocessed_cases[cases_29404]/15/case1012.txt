introduction 
plaintiff,ferial shamsian,appeals from a judgment dismissing her first amended complaint and denying her mandate petition as to defendants the department of conservation department two young,department director,and jim ferguson,assistant director of the california beverage container recycling program and two,and miller brewing company the corporate defendants.plaintiff alleged the defendants had failed to provide convenient,economical,and efficient beverage container redemption opportunities for california consumers as required by section,subdivision g of the california beverage container recycling and litter reduction act,public resources code section et the act.
plaintiff raises two contentions she claims are dispositive of this appeal.to begin with,plaintiff asserts defendants have a mandatory duty pursuant to section,subdivision g such that a private right of action challenging their alleged inaction may be pursued by her.the trial court ruled there was no mandatory duty created by section,subdivision g.also,plaintiff argues she can pursue her business and professions code section unfair competition claims.the trial court ruled equitable abstention principles barred plaintiff unfair competition claims.we agree with the trial court on both counts and affirm the judgment.
ii.background 
the legislature adopted the act in.stats,ch.the act creates a comprehensive administrative scheme designed to encourage and facilitate the recycling of used beverage containers.the act establishes a department administered program designed to achieve stated recycling goals through a complex arrangement of financial incentives.the act attempts to balance the competing interests of the varied participants in the beverage container and recycling industries.it requires for its success cooperation among manufacturers,distributors,recycling centers,supermarkets,and consumers.additionally,it attempts to make recycling convenient for the consuming public.et see californians against waste department of conservation th,d.
the act is administered and enforced by the department.see also.the department is authorized to adopt regulations,tit,et a violation of the act is an infraction punishable by a fine,subd.a or,in the case of fraud,by a fine as well as possible imprisonment,potentially in the state penitentiary,subd.b.the department is authorized,among other things,to assess civil penalties for violations of the act including unfair recycling competition et take disciplinary action seek restitution of money illegally paid issue cease and desist orders,subd.a and request that the attorney general seek injunctive relief,subd.e.penalties,restitution and other remedies imposed by the department can be enforced by means of a judgment having the same force and effect as a judgment in a civil action.
the legislature found and declared in section as follows a experience in this state and others demonstrates that financial incentives and convenient return systems ensure the efficient and recycling of beverage containers.accordingly,it is the intent of the legislature to encourage increased,and more convenient,beverage container redemption opportunities for all consumers.these redemption opportunities shall consist of dealer and other shopping center locations,independent and industry operated recycling centers,curbside programs,nonprofit dropoff programs,and other recycling systems that assure all consumers,in every region of the state,the opportunity to return beverage containers conveniently,efficiently,and economically.b california grocery,beer,soft drink,container manufacturing,labor,agricultural,consumer,environmental,government,citizen,recreational,taxpayer,and recycling groups have joined together in calling for an innovative program to generate redemption and recycling of beverage containers.c this division establishes a beverage container recycling goal of percent,and when the redemption rate for any one type of beverage container falls below percent,this division provides for an increased refund value.d it is the intent of the legislature to ensure that every container type proves its own recyclability.e it is the intent of the legislature to make redemption and recycling convenient to consumers,and the legislature hereby urges cities and counties,when exercising their zoning authority,to act favorably on the siting of multimaterial recycling centers,reverse vending machines,mobile recycling units,or other types of recycling opportunities,as necessary for consumer convenience,and the overall success of litter abatement and beverage container recycling in the state.f the purpose of this division is to create and maintain a marketplace where it is profitable to establish sufficient recycling centers and locations to provide consumers with convenient recycling opportunities through the establishment of minimum refund values and processing fees and,through the proper application of these elements,to enhance the profitability of recycling centers,recycling locations,and other beverage container recycling programs.g the responsibility to provide convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities rests jointly with manufacturers,distributors,dealers,recyclers,processors,and the department of conservation.h it is the intent of the legislature,in enacting this division,that all empty beverage containers redeemed shall be recycled,and that the responsibilities and regulations of the department shall be determined and implemented in a manner which favors the recycling of redeemed containers,as opposed to their disposal.i nothing in this division shall be interpreted as affecting the current business practices of scrap dealers or recycling centers,except that,to the extent they function as a recycling center or processor,they shall do so in accordance with this division j the program established by this division will contribute significantly to the reduction of the beverage container component of litter in this state.italics added.
section,subdivision a provides except as otherwise provided in this chapter,there shall be at least one certified recycling center or location within every convenience zone which accepts and pays the refund value,if any,at one location for all types of empty beverage containers convenience zone is defined in section,subdivision a as,the area within a mile radius of a supermarket.however,the department has discretion under specified circumstances to increase the size of a convenience zone in a rural region to within a radius of a supermarket,subd.b.the department also has discretion to grant an exemption from the section requirement of one certified recycling center or location within every convenience zone.section,subdivision b states in part the director may grant an exemption from the requirements of section for an individual convenience zone only after the department solicits public testimony on whether or not to provide an exemption from section.the solicitation process shall be designed by the department to ensure that operators of recycling centers,dealers,and members of the public in the jurisdiction affected by the proposed exemption are aware of the proposed exemption.
b.the first amended complaint and the mandate petition 
plaintiff first amended complaint and mandate petition were brought individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated.plaintiff central allegation was that defendants were jointly responsible for providing convenient,economical,and efficient beverage container redemption opportunities for california consumers pursuant to section,subdivision g of the act,but had failed to do so.only the first,sixth,ninth,tenth,and eleventh causes of action of the first amended complaint concerned the present defendants.in her first cause of action,plaintiff sought a writ of mandate to compel compliance with defendants mandatory statutory joint duty and responsibility to provide convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities as required by section,subdivision g of the act.plaintiff sought an order that all convenience zones include within its sic boundaries at least one recycling center as required by section.in her sixth cause of action,plaintiff sought restitution and disgorgement of profits as against defendants,other than the department,for engaging in unfair and unlawful business practices in violation of business and professions code section.plaintiff alleged defendants had jointly failed to implement the a ct by not providing convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities to california consumers in sufficient numbers to reach a recycling rate of percent,in violation of section,subdivision c establishing the percent recycling goal and section,subdivision g of the a ct setting forth the need for redemption opportunities.the ninth cause of action alleged the department had wrongfully and unlawfully failed to carry out its statutory duty to provide convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities as required by the a ct,including but not limited to section,subdivision g.plaintiff sought imposition of a constructive trust on unspent cash redemption value funds nonrefunded beverage container deposits in the department possession.the tenth cause of action,for an accounting,was brought against the department for violating section,subdivision g of the act.the eleventh cause of action sought declaratory relief as to the interpretation,application and effect of the a ct,including but not limited to section,subdivision g,and the rights,duties and responsibilities of the parties with respect thereto.
plaintiff separately filed code of civil procedure section mandate petition paralleled her first amended complaint.the first cause of action sought a writ of mandate to compel compliance with the mandatory statutory duties imposed by the act including but not limited to section,subdivision g.plaintiff requested an order commanding defendants to comply with the act,specifically section,subdivision g,by providing convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities for consumers,including but not limited to requiring at least one recycling center in every convenience zone.the remaining causes of action as against the present defendants were the sixth,for restitution and disgorgement of profits against the corporate defendants for engaging in unfair and unlawful business practices in violation of business and professions code section,in that they have jointly failed to implement the a ct by providing convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities to california beverage container consumers in adequate numbers to reach a recycling rate of percent,in violation of section,subdivision g of the a ct the ninth for imposition of a constructive trust against unredeemed cash redemption value funds in the department possession as a result of its failure to provide convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities as required by the act including section,subdivision g the tenth against the department for an accounting of unredeemed cash redemption value funds wrongfully retained because plaintiff and other consumers had insufficient redemption opportunities and the eleventh for a judicial declaration as to the interpretation,application and effect of the a ct,including but not limited to section,subdivision g plaintiff eleventh cause of action alleged section,subdivision g was not being adequately implemented.
c.the trial court ruling 
the parties agreed the trial court would determine certain threshold issues of law regarding the viability of plaintiff claims for relief in lieu of generalized demurrers to the first amended complaint.the trial court concluded there was no private right of action or mandatory duty of compliance under the act that would support plaintiff claims against defendants plaintiff had no standing to seek a writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section the act vested discretion in the department to develop a recycling program consistent with legislative goals and there was no ministerial act that plaintiff could compel there was no duty under the act and therefore no basis for an unlawful business practices claim under business and professions code section et and equitable abstention was appropriate in light of the comprehensive administrative scheme created to address beverage container recycling.
iii.discussion 
standards of review 
the trial court ruling was in the nature of a demurrer dismissal.therefore,consistent with the standard of review on appeal from an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d,aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,blank kirwan cal d.in addition,whether section,subdivision g imposes a mandatory duty or supports a private right of action is a question of statutory interpretation and of law for the court.haggis city of los angeles cal th,d,creason department of health services cal th,d.we exercise our independent judgment in resolving that issue.city of long beach department of industrial relations cal th,d,code civ.proc.mandate petition mcintosh aubry th,d same.we apply the following standard of statutory review described by our supreme court when interpreting a statute our primary task is to determine the legislature intent.citation.in doing so we turn first to the statutory language,since the words the legislature chose are the best indicators of its intent.freedom newspapers,orange county employees retirement system cal th,d,people jones cal th,d.further,our supreme court has noted if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature delaney superior court cal d,accord,wilcox birtwhistle cal th,d.
mandatory duty or private right of action 
the first important question before us is whether the act imposes a mandatory duty on the defendants to provide convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities,subd.g,the breach of which obligation creates a private right of action by plaintiff.with respect to a public entity such as the department,government code section allows an exception to governmental immunity and creates a private right of action where there is a mandatory duty to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury,haggis city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d,creason department of health services,supra,cal th at,d,nunn state of california cal d.the effect of government code section,subdivision a on the right to sue a public entity was described in creason department of health services,supra,cal th at pages,d,the california tort claims act provides that a public entity is not liable for injury arising from an act or omission except as provided by statute,subd.a see peterson san francisco community college dist.cal d.under government code section,as we have construed it,a public entity is liable for an injury proximately caused by its failure to discharge a mandatory duty designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury morris county of marin cal d,see washington county of contra costa th,d state of california superior court d.whether a particular statute is intended to impose a mandatory duty,rather than a mere obligation to perform a discretionary function,is a question of statutory interpretation for the courts.nunn state of california,supra,cal d at.if a statute does not require that a particular action be taken,government code section does not create the right to sue a public entity.haggis city of los angeles,supra,cal th at pages,d,creason department of health services,supra,cal th at,d.in creason,the supreme court emphasized the statutory scheme at issue,the hereditary disorders act,required the department of health services select accurate standards for testing for and reporting possible congenital hypothyroidism.creason department of health services,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court described the scope of discretion under the hereditary disorders act as follows t he statutory scheme at issue here makes reasonably clear that the state is given substantial discretion in formulating and reporting appropriate testing standards for hypothyroidism,although the legislature has specified certain general principles to guide the exercise of that discretion.moreover,although the hereditary disorders act included some mandatory language in describing the state obligations,the act provisions disclose no legislative intent to confer a private right of action for the state breach of its statutory duties.id.at,d.
the supreme court has described the nature of the duty that must be present in order for there to be statutory liability by a public entity s ection requires that the enactment at issue be obligatory,rather than merely discretionary or permissive,in its directions to the public entity it must require,rather than merely authorize or permit,that a particular action be taken or not taken.morris county of marin,supra,cal d at pp.it is not enough,moreover,that the public entity or officer have been under an obligation to perform a function if the function itself involves the exercise of discretion.creason department of health services,supra,cal th at pp,d,haggis city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d,see county of los angeles superior court th,d.plaintiff does not contend she has a cause of action against the corporate defendants in the absence of a duty such as would support a claim against the department.
plaintiff concedes the legislature did not grant an explicit right to sue to enforce the act.but our supreme court has held the absence of an express right to sue is not dispositive.santa clara county counsel woodside cal th,d.plaintiff argues the clear language of section,subdivision g imposes a joint mandatory duty on all of the defendants to provide convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities throughout the state.we agree with the trial court that a plain reading of section,subdivision g reveals it is a statement of legislative intent.section is unofficially entitled legislative findings and declarations.it begins with the phrase,the legislature finds and declares as follows.as noted previously,section,subdivision g,which is part of the legislative findings of the act,simply states,the responsibility to provide convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities rests jointly with manufacturers,distributors,dealers,recyclers,processors,and the department of conservation.with these words,the legislature conveyed its intent that the responsibility to provide redemption opportunities would rest not just with the department but with all of the principal participants in the beverage container recycling scheme,subd.g.however,as the courts of appeal have repeatedly held,a statement of legislative intent may not give rise to a mandatory duty.county of los angeles superior court,supra,th at,d macdonald state of california d.tirpak los angeles unified school dist.d.ibarra california coastal commission d.the statement of legislative intent in section,subdivision g does not impose a mandatory duty the breach of which gives rise to a private right of action.
at oral argument,plaintiff counsel asserted defendants mandatory duty also arose from section,subdivision a,which provides experience in this state and others demonstrates that financial incentives and convenient return systems ensure the efficient and recycling of beverage containers.accordingly,it is the intent of the legislature to encourage increased,and more convenient,beverage container redemption opportunities for all consumers.these redemption opportunities shall consist of dealer and other shopping center locations,independent and industry operated recycling centers,curbside programs,nonprofit dropoff programs,and other recycling systems that assure all consumers,in every region of the state,the opportunity to return beverage containers conveniently,efficiently,and economically.the foregoing analysis applies with equal force to section,subdivision a.for the reasons discussed above with respect to subdivision g,section,subdivision a is also a statement of legislative intent.the statement of legislative intent in section,subdivision a does not impose a mandatory duty.
plaintiff asserts a private right of action was intended by the legislature enactment of section,which provides upon the request of the department,the attorney general shall represent the department and the state in litigation concerning affairs of the department.plaintiff contends the legislature clearly expected the department would be sued to enforce the act.we disagree.section states only that the attorney general is required to represent the department in litigation concerning its affairs.this is consistent,for example,with section,subdivision e,which authorizes the department to ask the attorney general to seek injunctive relief on the department behalf to restrain activity in violation of a cease and desist order.nothing in the language of section suggests the legislature intended to allow individuals such as plaintiff to sue the department to enforce the act.
plaintiff relies on our supreme court analysis in common cause board of supervisors cal d,in holding that former elections code sections and authorized a private cause of action be brought to compel counties to design and implement voter outreach programs.the issue before the supreme court was whether under elections code section only the attorney general had the standing to bring suit to enforce the county registrar obligation to implement voter outreach programs.the supreme court held that a private cause of action could be pursued by an entity other than the attorney general and reasoned as follows first,the plain language of section contains no limitation on the right of private citizens to sue to enforce the section.to infer such a limitation would contradict our approval of citizen actions to require governmental officials to follow the law,expressed in our expansive interpretation of taxpayer standing see harman city and county of san francisco cal d,blair pitchess cal d,wirin parker cal d,and our recognition of a public interest exception to the requirement that a petitioner for writ of mandate have a personal beneficial interest in the proceedings green obledo cal d,bd.of soc.welfare county of cal d.in the absence of either an express limitation on citizen standing or any indication of legislative intent to confer exclusive powers on the attorney general,we decline to impose such a limitation on citizen actions to enforce section and its accompanying regulations.people city of south lake tahoe.conferral of enforcement power on attorney general not determinative of exclusivity question under california law.second,plaintiffs action is not based solely on section.to the contrary,they rely principally on section,which authorizes county clerks to deputize citizens as deputy registrars.it can not reasonably be maintained that,by enacting and providing for the enforcement of section mandates the adoption of outreach legislature intended to preclude citizens from bringing actions to enforce the provisions of section,a preexisting statute that governs counties deputization of voting registrars.were we to accept county contention,courts would be required to consider claims alleging violations of section in isolation from closely related claims alleging violations of section and its accompanying regulations.considerations of judicial efficiency militate strongly against such a result.common cause board of supervisors,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
common cause is not authority for the proposition advanced by plaintiff that section,subdivision g imposes a mandatory duty on defendants part to provide the statutorily sufficient redemption program.the language in common cause relied upon by plaintiff here relates to whether elections code section permitted the attorney general to sue to require counties to engage in statutorily mandated voter outreach programs.common cause board of supervisors,supra,cal d at.no similar provision of law is present here.because the issue presented before us is entirely different,common cause is not controlling authority on the mandatory duty issue.palmer gte california,cal th,d,an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered little auto stiegler,cal th,d,cases are not authority for propositions not considered.
plaintiff also relies on californians against waste department of conservation,supra,th at pages,d.in californians against waste,a nonprofit corporation sought a writ of mandate to compel the department to properly calculate statutory processing fees paid as a recycling incentive.id.at,d.in californians against waste,former associate justice conseuelo maria callahan identified the issue before the court of appeal thusly following amendments to section stats,ch,stats,ch,the department of conservation changed the way it calculated the processing fee.californians against waste,a nonprofit corporation that promotes and recycling policies,challenged the department reading of section.californians against waste maintained the department was setting processing fees too low,contrary to the language and intent of the act as amended.the trial court granted the petition for writ of mandate,finding that the department processing fee calculation employed a recycling factor not specifically included in the statute.on appeal,the department contends the plain language of the statute supports the department formula for calculating the processing fee paid by beverage manufacturers.it argues the approach urged by californians against waste and adopted by the trial court is patently absurd because it would lead to the creation of surplus funds in accounts unavailable for any of the salutary purposes of the act.the interpretation of section presents a question of law,which we review de novo.county of los angeles superior court th,d.having considered the plain language of section,and its relationship to the act as a whole,we agree with the trial court that the department reading of section is erroneous.californians against waste department of conservation,supra,th at,d.the foregoing was the sole issue before the court of appeal in californians against waste.there was no issue before the trial court or former associate justice callahan and her colleagues as to whether the statement of legislative purpose in section,subdivision g or the provisions of section,which allow the attorney general to represent the department under specified circumstances,gives rise to a private cause of action.therefore,californians against waste is not authority for the proposition that writ review is available to plaintiff or that a private right of action exists under the act.palmer gte california,supra,cal th at,d,little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,d.
plaintiff further argues defendants failed to fulfill their section,subdivision g duty to provide convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities in that they did not establish certified recycling locations as required by section,subdivision a.as noted above,section,subdivision a provides,except as otherwise provided in this chapter,there shall be at least one certified recycling center or location within every convenience zone which accepts and pays the refund value for all types of empty beverage containers convenience zone is defined in section as,the area within a mile radius of a supermarket.however,the department has discretion under specified circumstances to increase the size of a convenience zone to within a radius of a supermarket,subd.b.moreover,the department has discretion to grant exemptions from the requirements of section as set forth in section,subdivision b,which states in part the director may grant an exemption from the requirements of section for an individual convenience zone only after the department solicits public testimony on whether or not to provide an exemption from section.the solicitation process shall be designed by the department to ensure that operators of recycling centers,dealers,and members of the public in the jurisdiction affected by the proposed exemption are aware of the proposed exemption.
plaintiff reliance on section is unavailing for two reasons.first,with respect to the corporate defendants,plaintiff does not argue section by itself imposes any direct duty on them to establish certified recycling centers.instead,plaintiff relies on the purported joint mandatory obligation to provide convenient,efficient,and economical redemption opportunities in section,subdivision g,as the source of a duty on the part of the corporate defendants to establish at least one certified recycling center within every convenience zone.as discussed above,however,section,subdivision g does not create any joint mandatory duty to provide recycling opportunities.therefore,plaintiff can not rely on section,subdivision g to impose on the corporate defendants a duty to establish certified recycling centers.second,with respect to the department,our supreme court has held that a statute creates a mandatory duty sufficient to impose liability on a public entity only when it requires,rather than allows,the governmental agency to take a particular action.haggis city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d,creason department of health services,supra,cal th at,d,morris county of marin,supra,cal d at.the supreme court has explained,it is not enough that the public entity or officer have been under an obligation to perform a function if the function itself involves the exercise of discretion.creason department of health services,supra,cal th at pp,d.haggis city of los angeles,supra,cal th at pages,d.section,subdivision a does not require that the department establish at least one certified recycling center or location within a mile radius of every supermarket.section,subdivision a states,except as otherwise provided in this chapter,there shall be italics added.the chapter,specifically section,subdivision b and,provides otherwise.section,subdivision b provides that the department has discretion to increase a convenience zone otherwise not being served by a certified recycling center or location to within a radius of a supermarket,subd.b.that is,the department has discretion to require at least one certified recycling center be established within a radius of a supermarket in a rural region rather than within a mile zone.moreover,under section,subdivision b,the department has discretion to grant an exemption from the requirements of section that is,to not require a certified recycling center within a convenience zone at all.no cause of action will lie against the department with respect to the placement of certified recycling centers or locations within convenience zones because the act does not require the department to take a particular action.the department obligation to perform the function set forth in section involves the exercise of discretion.
in her reply brief,plaintiff asserts section,subdivision g,imposing a joint responsibility to provide redemption opportunities,section,subdivision a,describing redemption opportunities as including industry operated recycling centers,and various references in the act to reverse vending machines,subd.e,f,g,h,should be construed together to require beverage,the corporate provide reverse vending machines in recycling centers.we need not discuss this argument at length.it is sufficient to note that it relies on section,subdivision g,a statement of legislative intent,as establishing the joint mandatory obligation.as we have noted,section,subdivision g provides no mandatory duty of the type which can give rise to a right of action.
writ relief 
the trial court found a writ petition would not lie in the absence of a clear,present duty on defendants part.because the pertinent facts are undisputed and the issue is one of statutory interpretation,our review of the trial court decision is de novo.marshall pasadena unified school dist.th,d catalina investments,jones th,d beverly anderson th,d.plaintiff writ petition was properly denied.pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,a writ of mandate may be issued by any court to any inferior tribunal,corporation,board,or person,to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins,as a duty resulting from an office,trust,or station,or to compel the admission of a party to the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which
