plaintiff stacie harrold appeals from an order denying her motion to certify a class in her action against levi strauss and levi only stores,collectively,levi for requesting and recording email addresses from customers paying for purchases with a credit card,allegedly in violation of the song beverly credit card act of,et the act,specifically section.the trial court determined that plaintiff complaint fails to satisfy the requirements for certification of a class,based on its conclusion that section does not prohibit the collection of personal identification information once a credit card transaction has been concluded.the appeal turns on the correctness of this interpretation of the act.since we conclude the trial court correctly interpreted the statute,we shall affirm the order denying class certification.
background 
plaintiff first amended complaint alleges that plaintiff entered into a credit card purchase transaction with defendants,which did not involve mail order,shipping or cash advances.however,as part of defendants information capture policy,and in conjunction with the credit card sales transaction,plaintiff was asked for personal identification information,in the form of her email address,by defendants employee attending to the transaction.plaintiff provided the requested personal identification information,which was entered into the electronic sales register at the checkout counter adjacent to both defendants employee and plaintiff.the amended complaint continued defendants conduct as alleged herein expressly violated california civil code section.civil code section a provides,in relevant part,that n o person,firm,partnership,association,or corporation that accepts credit cards for the transaction of business shall request,or require as a condition to accepting the credit card as payment in full or in part for goods or services,the cardholder to provide personal identification information,which the person,firm,partnership,association,or corporation accepting the credit card writes,causes to be written,or otherwise records upon the credit card transaction form or otherwise.emphasis added.for purposes of this appeal,levi has assumed,as shall we,that an email address is personal identification information within the meaning of this provision 
the amended complaint defines the purported class as all persons from whom defendants requested and recorded personal identification information in conjunction with a credit card purchase transaction at a california retail store during a defined time period.
in support of her motion for certification of such a class plaintiff submitted her own declaration in which she stated on july,i visited the levi store in napa,california.on that occasion,after selecting the items that i intended to purchase,i proceeded to the cashier section of levi store to pay for the merchandise using a credit card.after i provided the items to the cashier at the register,the cashier informed me of the amount due.i then paid for the merchandise using my credit card.while i was standing at the cash register for my credit card purchase transaction,levi cashier requested my email address.per the cashier request,i provided the cashier with my email address.at her deposition,plaintiff testified she did not recall whether the request was made before or after she had signed for the purchase but that it was before the purchased merchandise was bagged and handed to her.
the papers submitted in support of and in opposition to the class certification motion indicate that levi conducts an email marketing program and has a written policy concerning precisely when and how store clerks should request from customers their email address for inclusion in the program.the documents articulating this policy have been filed under seal,so that we shall not here recite the particulars,but it is undisputed that under this policy the customer email address is not to be requested until after the credit card purchase transaction has been completed.except to the extent that plaintiff testimony may indicate a departure from this policy in the case of her purchase,no evidence was submitted indicating that the policy is not universally followed.levi submitted substantial evidence to the effect that employees are trained to adhere to this policy and that they always wait until the receipt is printed,handed over to the customer and the merchandise is bagged before providing customers the opportunity to join the email program and requesting their email address.except for plaintiff testimony,the record contains no evidence of instances in which the policy has not been observed.
in denying class certification,the trial court held that section prohibits requests for personal identification information only as a condition to accepting the credit card as payment and that,therefore,such a request made after the credit card transaction has been completed does not violate the statute.thus,class certification is not appropriate,the court ruled,because plaintiff failed to show that there is a numerous class of persons whose email addresses have been obtained in violation of the terms of the statute.moreover,since plaintiff has alleged that her email address was requested before the transaction was completed,contrary to the policy that the evidence shows was applied to all other levi customers,her claim is not typical of the claims of other purported class members.
plaintiff has timely appealed from the order denying class certification 
discussion 
plaintiff contends that the trial court ruling is based on an incorrect interpretation of section.plaintiff argues that r egardless of when the cashier obtains a credit card customer personal identification information,whether it is prior to handing the customer the receipt and merchandise or a split second after,the retailer is still amassing unnecessary personal identification information regardless of whether levi requested a credit card customer personal identification information at the beginning,middle,or end of the transaction,it still violated section.a violation of section occurs when a retailer requests and records personal identification information from a customer who pays by credit card.
the song beverly credit card act of is designed to promote consumer protection.citation.one of its provisions,section,prohibits businesses from requesting that cardholders provide personal identification information during credit card transactions,and then recording that information.pineda williams sonoma stores,cal th,italics added,citing,subd.a.we agree with plaintiff that the prohibition applies at all times during and prior to the completion of a credit card transaction.however,there is no support for her contention that the prohibition continues beyond that point.
plaintiff does not dispute that a credit card purchase may reasonably be considered to have been concluded when the customer receives a receipt for the purchase,following acceptance of the credit card,and the merchandise has been delivered to the customer.levi policy does not permit the sales clerk to ask the customer about joining its email program or to request the customer email address prior to that point.the transaction having been concluded,such a request can not reasonably be considered by the customer or by anyone else as a condition of acceptance of the credit card as a form of payment.
plaintiff contends that the phrase as a condition to accepting the credit card as payment in full or in part for goods or services qualifies only the prohibition of requiring the submission of personal identification information as a condition to acceptance of the credit card for payment.she argues that this phrase does not qualify the prohibition of requesting such information from credit card customers.plaintiff argues that this interpretation is required by the last antecedent rule of statutory interpretation under which by virtue of the comma following the word request in section,subdivision a see fn,ante,the as a condition clause qualifies only the word require.white county of sacramento cal d.under this reading,the statute imposes an absolute prohibition o
