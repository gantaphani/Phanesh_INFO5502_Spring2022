introduction 
this is an appeal from a judgment entered after a court trial in favor of adam schwartz respondent against visa international service association,visa collectively visa and mastercard international incorporated mastercard respondent claims at trial were founded exclusively on california business and professions code section et,california unfair competition law the ucl 
visa and mastercard jointly appellants allege numerous claims of error.we do not reach these claims,however,because we hold that recent amendments to the ucl,which became effective while this appeal was pending,bar the present action and require us to reverse the judgment.
ii.statement of facts 
the issue we address requires only a brief summary of the lengthy and complex proceedings below 
in january,respondent filed this action against appellants on behalf of the general public.respondent alleged appellants violated the ucl by engaging in unlawful business practices relating to the provision of currency conversion services in connection with visa and mastercard branded credit card transactions made in foreign currencies by cardholders.
prior to trial,respondent had alleged state and federal antitrust theories to support his claims.but he withdrew his antitrust and conspiracy allegations,pursuant to a trial court order,after appellants moved to stay this action pending resolution of a federal litigation class action alleging that visa,mastercard and several large banks violated the federal truth in lending act and antitrust laws by failing to disclose currency conversion fees charged to cardholders.thus,the claims tried to and resolved by the trial court in this case were founded exclusively on the ucl.
the trial court filed its statement of decision on april.it found that several state and federal statutes,including the areias credit card full disclosure act of,et and the federal truth in lending act et evidence a substantial legislative policy that consumers be informed of the costs related to the use of credit cards.the trial court held that appellants violated this policy and engaged in a deceptive business practice in violation of the ucl by designing,developing and implementing conversion systems which were intended to and do deprive credit card customers of information concerning the cost of currency conversion.
facts found by the trial court to support its holding included the following appellants are engaged in the currency conversion business appellants practices relating to this business include the use of a one percent currency conversion fee that was designed,developed,and implemented so that the fee would be concealed from,yet ultimately paid by,cardholders this practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers and to competition appellants have control over the contents of cardholder agreements and disclosures that their member banks make to cardholders appellants have a duty to consumers to disclose their currency conversion fees appellants breached their duty of disclosure by failing to require member banks to make adequate disclosures of the currency conversion fees in solicitations,cardholder agreements and billing statements.
the trial court awarded respondent injunctive relief and ordered appellants to pay restitution.appellants were ordered to amend their operating rules,regulations and member agreements to require all members who issue their respective credit cards and who bill their cardholders a currency conversion fee to make full and effective disclosure of the fee to consumers.the court further ordered appellants to restore the one percent currency conversion fee to all customers who were charged and paid the fee from february,to the present.
judgment was entered against appellants on october.a motion for new trial was denied on december.appellants each filed a notice of appeal on december.
iii.proposition 
on november,california voters approved state ballot initiative proposition which became effective the following day.cal,art.ii,subd.a.proposition amended certain provisions of the ucl and the false advertising law.the two amendments relevant to our analysis affect the right of private litigants to prosecute ucl actions.
before proposition was passed,an uninjured private party could bring an ucl action on behalf of the general public,and could obtain remedies for the benefit of.former 
proposition amended the provision in section of the ucl which pertains to private litigants to read actions for any relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted exclusively by any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.section was also amended,and now reads,in part any person may pursue representative claims or relief on behalf of others only if the claimant meets the standing requirements of section and complies with section of the code of civil procedure 
on january,appellants filed a motion in this court for leave to file supplemental briefs regarding proposition.this court granted appellants motion on february,and directed both appellants and respondent to file briefs regarding the applicability of proposition.
iv.discussion 
issue presented 
respondent brought this action on behalf of the general public as a private attorney general and sought injunctive and restitutionary relief on behalf of individuals other than himself.respondent has never alleged that he was injured by appellants business practices.indeed,respondent has never had a mastercard or credit card.nor has he ever used any credit card to make a purchase in a foreign currency.
as amended by proposition,the ucl now authorizes the filing of an injunctive or restitutionary relief action only by certain public prosecutors and by any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.in addition,the ucl now authorizes a person to pursue a representative action only if he or she meets the class certification requirements of section of the code of civil procedure.
thus,there is no dispute that,if proposition applies to this case,respondent is not authorized to maintain this ucl action against appellants.what is disputed is whether proposition applies notwithstanding the fact that it became effective after respondent obtained a judgment in the trial court to support his contention that proposition does not apply here,respondent relies primarily on the rule that a new statute will not be construed to affect pending causes of action absent a clear expression of legislative or voter intent.as we will explain,respondent reliance on this rule is misplaced.
proposition applies in this case 
directly relevant to this issue is the statutory repeal rule.that rule states that a cause of action or remedy dependent on a statute falls with a repeal of the statute,even after the action thereon is pending,in the absence of a saving clause in the repealing statute.citations.callet alioto cal,callet.the repeal of a statute abates all causes of action based on that statute that have not been merged into a final judgment.southern service county of los angeles cal d,southern service governing board mann cal d,mann younger superior court cal d,younger an action wholly dependent on statute abates if the statute is repealed without a saving clause before the judgment is final see also lemon los angeles terminal ry.d.
the statutory repeal rule applies only to the repeal of a cause of action or remedy created by statute.it does not apply to the repeal of a common law rule or a statutory codification of a common law rule.callet,supra,cal.at.when a statute repeals a cause of action or remedy derived from the common law,courts apply a presumption that,absent a clear expressed intention to the contrary,a new statute will not be construed so as to affect pending causes of action.see also evangelatos superior court cal d,evangelatos proposition,which modified the common law joint and several liability doctrine did not apply to cases pending when proposition became effective.
the justification for the statutory repeal rule is that all statutory remedies are pursued
