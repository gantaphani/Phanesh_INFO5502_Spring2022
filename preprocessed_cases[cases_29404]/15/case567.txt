watoshina lynn compton appeals the district court dismissal of her claim under section of the hawaii revised statutes,which authorizes consumers to bring an action based upon unfair or deceptive acts or practices.d referred to herein as a udap claim.because compton complaint adequately alleges that unfair and deceptive acts by bank of america corporation bac caused an injury resulting in damages,we reverse the district court.
we assume the following facts taken from the complaint are true for the purpose of our review.see metzler inv.gmbh corinthian,cir.
in,compton purchased a piece of real property through a privately funded construction loan.compton later sought to refinance this loan and,in may,executed a promissory note and mortgage giving countrywide home loans,a security interest in the property.after compton refinanced her mortgage and before the events at issue in this case,bac acquired countrywide.
after making timely loan payments for more than two years,compton began suffering financial difficulties due to a decline in her fiberglass pool business.in august,while still making timely payments,compton contacted bac to inquire about modifying her loan to lower the monthly payments.the bac representative informed her that she would not qualify for a loan modification unless she was at least days behind on her loan payments.compton continued making timely payments for another eight months.
in may,compton stopped making loan payments and subsequently applied for a loan modification.according to her complaint,compton simple request to modify her loan resulted in a entanglement in a kafkaesque nightmare.compton alleges that during the period from may to august,she indefatigably sought a loan modification,while bac intentionally frustrated her efforts,gave her misleading and erroneous advice,and imposed a list of new requirements and demands,despite knowing that a loan modification agreement would never be forthcoming.after compton submitted her first loan modification application,the complaint alleges,a series of bac representatives told compton that the application was under review,continued to demand further documentation,failed to respond to her requests for updates,and finally told her that her loan modification application file had been closed.her second loan modification application met with the same fate.in august,bac approved her third loan modification application and sent compton a modification agreement.after compton signed the modification agreement,had it notarized,and returned it to the bank,a bac representative informed her that the agreement was incomplete due to a problem with the notary signature block.compton submitted documents,but a bac representative told compton that the notary stamp was still deficient and she would have to submit a fourth modification application.after compton submitted this fourth application,bac representatives assured compton that the bank would not commence foreclosure proceedings while the modification process was underway.despite these repeated assurances,on august,compton learned that a notice of foreclosure had been recorded against her property.when she contacted bac regarding the foreclosure notice,she learned that her fourth application had been denied due to lack of documentation and her file closed on august.several months later,when compton tried to apply for a fifth time,a different representative informed compton that the foreclosure notice rendered her ineligible for a loan modification.
on march,compton filed a complaint in the district court alleging a udap claim under section d,among other claims,and seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages.compton alleged that bac engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices,including misinforming her that only borrowers who were at least days behind on their mortgage payments were eligible for loan modifications,although bac does not,in fact,have such a requirement purposefully delaying her efforts to negotiate a loan modification and repeatedly terminating her loan modification requests misrepresenting the length of time it would take to process her loan modification,and knowingly and purposefully drawing out the modification process so that she would end up in foreclosure and misrepresenting that foreclosure proceedings would not be brought against her so long as her loan modification application remained pending,and then backdating paperwork so it would falsely appear that bac commenced foreclosure proceedings only after denying her loan modification application.compton alleges that as a result of bac misrepresentations and delays,she spent almost two years in a futile effort to modify her mortgage loan and,as a result of failing to obtain a modification,ended up in foreclosure.
