background 
plaintiff stanley kapelanski,an immigrant from poland,practices dentistry in chicago,illinois,and his wife,plaintiff grace kapelanski,manages the dental practice.the kapelanskis were interested in making financial investments.calvert heskiel,a friend of the kapelanskis,put them in contact with defendant scott johnson,an independent businessman based in florida.after a series of telephone conversations with johnson,the kapelanskis transferred to johnson in july to invest in what johnson termed an offshore venture in the gateway international group.
the investment relationship between the parties expanded in late.in october,johnson and the kapelanskis physically met in chicago.johnson urged the kapelanskis to invest in automatic teller machines atms through his company.the kapelanskis agreed to purchase the atms and wired johnson a total of in four separate installments from october,to february,
on october,the kapelanskis also decided to invest an additional in a deal the parties referred to as the offshore trading program otp.the kapelanskis transferred to the escrow account of feder dunn,johnson attorneys,for investment in the otp.in december,johnson sent the kapelanskis a check for.this amount represented a return on their july investment.the kapelanskis repeatedly requested information from johnson regarding both their otp and atm investments.these requests included items such as proof of purchase,locations,and serial numbers for the atm machines.johnson did not respond to the kapelanskis requests,and the plaintiffs never received any proof of purchase for the atms,nor any information pertaining to the otp.
the kapelanskis filed this action for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty under illinois law against johnson.the kapelanskis sought both compensatory and punitive damages for their atm and otp investments.during the litigation,despite three document requests and a court order demanding johnson compliance,johnson failed to produce evidence that the otp investment program actually existed.johnson also failed to produce any evidence pertaining to proof of purchase of the atms.
the matter went to trial where only three witnesses,the kapelanskis and johnson,testified.the jury was shown plaintiffs exhibits of wire transfers.these wire transfers demonstrated that two days after johnson had transferred of the plaintiffs money to a russel pierce for the otp,pierce sent to johnson.plaintiffs presented evidence at trial which showed that johnson placed the for the atms into his business account.from this business account,johnson later withdrew almost to purchase a ski house in colorado,a condominium,designer mountain bikes,boating equipment and two luxury and a jaguar.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of the kapelanskis.the jury awarded the kapelanskis in compensatory damages and in punitive damages on their fraud claim.the district court entered judgment on the jury verdict.the district court also,in an oral ruling,denied the defendant request for a new trial.
johnson appeals on several grounds.he argues that the district court improperly denied his motion to amend the judgment or for a new trial.johnson claims that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to support the verdict for the plaintiffs.johnson also argues that the compensatory and punitive damage awards are invalid.johnson further contends that the district court judge committed error when he selectively questioned johnson and allegedly showed disbelief of johnson credibility in front of the jury.finally,the defendant argues that the district court allowed the plaintiffs to alter their trial theory in violation of its order.
