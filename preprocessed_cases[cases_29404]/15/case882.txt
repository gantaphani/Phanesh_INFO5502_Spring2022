plaintiff audrey medrazo,on behalf of herself and others similarly situated,filed a class action lawsuit against defendant honda of north hnh asserting claims under the unfair competition law bus,et ucl and the consumer legal remedies act,et clra,based upon hnh alleged violations of vehicle code sections and hereafter section and section.this is the second appeal in this case.in the first appeal,we reversed the trial court denial of class certification and directed that the class be certified.medrazo honda of north hollywood th,d medrazo i.in this appeal,medrazo challenges the trial court granting of hnh motion for judgment,which was filed after medrazo completed her presentation of evidence at trial.the trial court found that medrazo failed to establish that she,or any other class member,was injured by hnh conduct,and therefore hnh was entitled to judgment on the ucl and clra claims.we reverse the judgment as to the ucl claim,but we affirm the judgment as to the clra claim on the ground that medrazo forfeited any issue regarding that claim by failing to adequately address it in her briefs on appeal.
background 
as noted,medrazo ucl and clra claims are based upon her allegation that hnh sold new motorcycles without complying with section and section.section provides in relevant part it is unlawful and a violation of this code for a dealer issued a license pursuant to this article to sell,offer for sale,or display any new vehicle,as follows a a new motorcycle unless there is securely attached thereto a statement as required by section.section provides a no dealer shall sell,offer for sale,or display,any new,assembled motorcycle on its premises,unless there is securely attached to its handlebar a label,approved by the department of motor vehicles,furnished by the manufacturer,on which the manufacturer shall clearly indicate the following the recommended retail price of the motorcycle.the recommended price for each accessory or item of optional equipment physically attached to the motorcycle at the time of its delivery to the dealer.b the dealer shall clearly indicate on the label,furnished by the manufacturer,the following the amount charged,if any,over and above the suggested retail price for transportation to the dealership.the amount charged,if any,for the assembly,preparation,or both,of the motorcycle.the amount charged,if any,for each dealer added accessory or item of optional equipment.the total recommended retail price of the vehicle which shall be the aggregate value of paragraphs and of subdivision a and paragraphs,and of subdivision b.
as explained in our prior opinion,in moving for class certification,medrazo presented evidence that when she bought a honda motorcycle from hnh,there was no label also known as a hanger tag or hang tag attached to it more than in dealer charges were added to the cost of the motorcycle she purchased hnh did not attach hanger tags to any suzuki or yamaha motorcycles it offered for sale because those manufacturers did not provide hanger tags although honda provided hanger tags for all of its motorcycles,hnh did not attach the tags to all of the honda motorcycles,and did not include the dealer charges on all of the hanger tags that were attached and in the four years prior to june,when medrazo filed her complaint,hnh sold more than motorcycles.medrazo i,th at,d.medrazo sought to certify the class,which was defined as follows all purchasers of new motorcycles who were charged for destination,assembly or other dealer added accessories that were not disclosed on a hanger tag since august,being four years prior to the filing of this lawsuit.ibid.the trial court denied class certification,finding among other things that common issues did not predominate.id.at,d.we reversed the court denial of certification because even though there are individual issues that must be resolved for example,each honda purchaser must establish there was no hanger tag attached to the motorcycle he or she purchased the costs were not disclosed on the hanger tag,and a determination must be made of the amount of restitution if any owed to each class member those issues can be effectively and pale in comparison to the substance and scope of the issues common to the class id.at,d.we directed the trial court,on remand,to certify the class.id.at,d.
following remand,the case was tried before the court in a bench trial before trial,medrazo filed a trial brief in which she explained the basis for her claims and addressed hnh anticipated defenses.
in her trial brief,medrazo explained that her ucl claim was based on three of the four prongs of the ucl.she asserted that hnh sale of motorcycles without hanger tags that disclosed the charges for freight and destination was an unlawful business practice a fraudulent business practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue,or misleading advertising.regarding her clra claim,she explained that hnh alleged conduct fell within the definition of five of the practices proscribed by the clra representing that goods or services have approval,characteristics or benefits which they do not have,subd.a advertising goods or services with intent not to sell them as advertised,subd.a making false or misleading statements of fact concerning reasons for,existence of,or amounts of price reductions,subd.a representing that a transaction confers or involves rights,remedies,or obligations which it does not have or involve,or which are prohibited by law,subd.a and inserting an unconscionable provision in the contract,subd.a.
addressing hnh anticipated defenses,medrazo argued that hnh assertion that it did not have to attach any hanger tags on suzuki or yamaha motorcycles because those manufacturers did not provide tags was contrary to the history of section hnh ultimate disclosure of the charges once the customer sat down to negotiate the final purchase terms is not a defense to medrazo claims because section and section are designed to prevent dealers from enticing customers to commence negotiations by quoting a lower price than it intends to charge and proof of individual reliance by class members on hnh deceptive practice is not required to impose restitution liability against hnh under the ucl.
medrazo presented two witnesses at trial herself and david denman,hnh sales manager examined under.
medrazo testified that she went to hnh in september with her boyfriend to purchase a motorcycle for him.she did not see any hanger tags on any of the motorcycles,although there were some price stickers on the windshields of some of them.there was no hanger tag or price sticker on the motorcycle she and her boyfriend were interested in they discussed the price of the motorcycle with a salesman,but he did not disclose the destination charges or the total price until she was presented with the sales contract.she signed a contract to purchase the motorcycle,which stated,among other charges,the cash price of the motorcycle,the cash price for,and the total price for the vehicle and accessories.she agreed to pay the total price which included other fees and taxes over months.she and her boyfriend had agreed that she would make the payment for the first two months,and he would pay the remainder.medrazo made the payment for the first two months as agreed,and owes more than under the purchase agreement 
denman testified that he is the sales manager for hnh,a position he has held for to years.since,hnh has sold three lines of motorcycles honda,yamaha,and suzuki.from approximately until sometime after the instant lawsuit was filed,the only time hnh put any kind of price tag on a suzuki or yamaha motorcycle was when the motorcycle was on a specific sale,selling for less than the manufacturer suggested retail price,or msrp.neither suzuki nor yamaha provided hanger tags for their motorcycles,but honda did provide them for its motorcycles.when new hondas were delivered,hnh lot porters were supposed to attach the hanger tags to the motorcycles,and a salesman was supposed to write the charges on the tags,but there was no specific procedure to ensure that those things got done,and sometimes they did not get done.denman explained that if he was caught up on all of his work and there was a lot porter standing around doing nothing,he would instruct the lot porter to attach hanger tags to honda motorcycles that were missing tags.even when hanger tags were attached to the hondas,however,they did not seem to last more than a few days before they were destroyed,pulled off,or blown off.
denman testified that a customer who was looking at motorcycles on the lot could ask a salesperson for the price of a motorcycle he or she was interested in if it did not have a hanger tag.the salespeople were instructed to tell the customer only the msrp.if the customer wanted to purchase the motorcycle,the salesperson would take him or her inside to negotiate the terms of sale.at that time,the salesperson would complete a worksheet that disclosed any charges which were different for each kind of motorcycle hnh had a list of the standardized charges for each kind.once the negotiations over the sales price were completed,the customer would be taken to a financial office to have the final contract prepared.
in the course of his testimony,denman identified the hanger tag for the motorcycle medrazo bought,which hnh located in response to a discovery request he conceded that,since hnh still possessed the hanger tag,it probably had not been attached to the motorcycle when medrazo bought it.the hanger tag showed the msrp for the vehicle,but it did not show any charges.
denman also testified that after this lawsuit was filed,hnh changed its practice with regard to hanger tags.first,it created its own hanger tags for suzukis and yamahas based upon the tags.next,it laminated the hanger tags in plastic to keep them from being destroyed or blown off.finally,it pays a specific salesperson additional money to walk the floor every day to look for and replace missing hanger tags.
after denman finished his testimony as part of medrazo,medrazo rested,subject to a proposed stipulation regarding the identities and files of the class members before beginning its,hnh moved for judgment under code of civil procedure section.hnh argued it was entitled to judgment on the ucl claim because medrazo failed to show she suffered injury in fact as a result of hnh alleged violation of section and section,and therefore lacked standing to sue under business and professions code section,because she was informed of the charges before she entered into the purchase contract.it also argued it was entitled to judgment on the clra because she failed to establish actual injury as to herself or any class member,and because she failed to present evidence to show that hnh engaged in any of the practices prohibited by civil code section.finally,hnh argued that medrazo failed to establish the amount of restitution allegedly owed to herself or any other class member.
the trial court granted hnh motion.in its statement of decision,the court found that medrazo was informed of the all the charges and was given an ample opportunity to read the purchase contract and ask questions before she signed the contract she failed to produce any evidence that she was misled by,or suffered any injury in fact as a result of,hnh alleged failure to comply with section,and therefore she lacked standing to recover any relief under the ucl or the clra she failed to present any evidence that any class member was injured as a result of hnh alleged failure to comply with section her testimony that there was no hanger tag attached to the motorcycle she purchased was not credible she failed to show the amounts of charges that were charged to any other hnh customer and she failed to establish any basis on which to impose any injunctive relief against hnh.the court entered judgment in favor of hnh,from which medrazo appeals 
discussion 
medrazo contends the trial court finding that she lacked standing was improper because the standing requirement under the ucl applies only to class certification and the finding is unsupported by the evidence the trial court erred in concluding that medrazo and the class members must show actual reliance on the of charges in order to establish injury in fact under the ucl and the trial court finding that there was insufficient evidence to establish the amount of restitution allegedly owed to each class member was premature.we conclude that the trial court was required to determine whether medrazo has standing under the ucl,but its finding that she did not suffer injury in fact was based upon an incorrect application of the law and was contrary to the evidence presented at trial medrazo was not required to show actual reliance on hnh alleged nondisclosure by herself or by the class members to be entitled to restitution under the unlawful prong of the ucl,and she presented sufficient evidence to establish economic injury under the ucl.we also conclude that the trial court finding that medrazo failed to establish the amount of restitution allegedly owed to each class member was premature in light of hnh failure to produce the customer files or information necessary for medrazo to establish those amounts.finally,we conclude that medrazo has forfeited any issue regarding her clra claim by failing to specifically address that claim in her opening brief.
standard of review 
in a nonjury trial,a party may move for judgment in its favor under code civ,after the opposing party has completed presentation of its evidence.citation.the judge,sitting as trier of fact,may weigh the evidence and order judgment in favor of the moving party.citation.the purpose of code of civil procedure section is to dispense with the need for the defendant to produce evidence where the court is persuaded that the plaintiff has failed to sustain its burden of proof.citation.because the trial court evaluates the evidence as a trier of fact,it may refuse to believe some witnesses while crediting the testimony of others.citation.combs skyriver communications,th,d,fn.omitted.
the standard of review after a trial court issues judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section is the same as if the court had rendered judgment after a completed trial that is,in reviewing the questions of fact decided by the trial court,the substantial evidence rule applies.an appellate court must view the evidence most favorably to the respondents and uphold the judgment if there is any substantial evidence to support it.citations.however where,as here,we are called upon to review a conclusion of law based on undisputed facts,we are not bound by the trial court decision and are free to draw our own conclusions of law.citation.pettus cole th,d.
in this case,the issues medrazo raises on appeal challenge the trial court application of law to undisputed facts.therefore,our review is de novo.
medrazo was required to establish her standing under the ucl 
before november,california courts consistently held that liability for restitution under the ucl could be imposed against a defendant without any individualized proof of causation or injury the plaintiff needed only to show that the defendant engaged in a practice that was unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent and that the defendant may have acquired money or property by means of that practice.steroid hormone product cases th,d steroid cases.in the november general election,the voters approved proposition,which amended the ucl to impose a standing requirement for private actions for relief.under the amended ucl,a private action for relief may be maintained only if the person bringing the action has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition,quoting bus.when the private action is brought as a class action,only the named plaintiff is required to meet this standing requirement.in re tobacco ii cases cal th,d,tobacco ii steroid cases,supra,th at,d.
medrazo argues that she was not required to establish at trial her standing to bring a representative action under the ucl because the standing requirement applies only at the time of class certification and she was found to have standing at that time.she is incorrect.even if she had been found to have standing at the time of class certification although we note that our prior opinio
