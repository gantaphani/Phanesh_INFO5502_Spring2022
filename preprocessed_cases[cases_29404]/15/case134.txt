the government appeals from a july,order of the district court for the western district of new york richard arcara,judge granting a preliminary injunction to stay enforcement of provisions of the prevent all cigarette trafficking act pact act requiring cigarette sellers to pay state excise taxes.the government argues that the district court erred in concluding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the pact act provision requiring tobacco sellers to pay state excise taxes,regardless of their contact with that state,violates the constitution due process clause.because we find the district court entry of the preliminary injunction was not an abuse of discretion,we affirm.
background 
the pact act,signed into law on march,imposes strict restrictions on the delivery sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco,a,stat.a delivery sale occurs when the buyer and seller are not in each other physical presence at the time the buyer requests or receives the cigarettes,as when cigarettes are ordered over the internet and delivered by mail.in order to prevent tobacco smuggling and ensure the collection of all tobacco taxes,the statute demands that delivery sellers comply with the same laws that apply to tobacco retailers.stat.at.to that end,the pact act requires delivery sellers to pay excise taxes,obey licensing and requirements,and otherwise comply with state and local tobacco laws as if the delivery sales occurred entirely within the specific state and place where the tobacco product is delivered.a.
red earth,llc red earth is a tobacco retail business and delivery seller under the pact act that is located on the cattaraugus indian reservation in the territory of the seneca nation of indians in new york state.the business is owned by aaron pierce,an enrolled member of the seneca nation.red earth is a member of the seneca free trade association sfta,a organization that represents hundreds of businesses licensed by the seneca nation.the sfta membership includes at least tobacco retailers that sell and ship cigarettes to customers across the united states.
red earth and other sfta members,as native american retailers operating in indian country,can purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products free of state and local excise taxes.see dep t of taxation fin.milhelm attea,d.prior to the pact act,those tax savings were passed along to their customers sfta retailers sold cigarettes to customers via phone,fax,and the internet,and shipped them by mail.for these sales,state and local governments could collect excise taxes only directly from the customers,using sales reports that tobacco sellers have to file with state tobacco tax administrators under the jenkins act of see hemi group,llc city of new york,d.red earth business model,according to pierce,is predicated upon selling cigarettes free of new york state sales taxes by utilizing the internet,telephone,and mail.
the pact act does away with this business model by imposing on delivery sellers the burden of collecting taxes.cigarette products can not be sold or delivered until any state or local excise tax has been paid,with required stamps or other indicia that the excise tax has been paid properly affixed or applied to the product.d.the statute bars the delivery of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco through the postal service,a,and imposes strict shipping,packaging,and requirements,b,c.violators are subject to civil and criminal penalties,including,for the first violation,up to three years imprisonment and fines up to the greater of or two percent of the delivery seller gross sales of tobacco products during the period ending on the date of the violation.see a,b.
on june,four days before the pact act was to go into effect,pierce and red earth challenged the statute constitutionality in a complaint filed in the western district of new york.the district court temporarily stayed enforcement of the statute as to pierce and red earth.after a similar complaint was filed by the sfta,the district court consolidated the actions and expanded the stay to protect the sfta full membership.
on july,the district court,finding that red earth,pierce,and the sfta collectively plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their due process claim,entered a preliminary injunction that stayed enforcement of the pact act provisions requiring delivery sellers to prepay excise taxes and comply with all laws as if the delivery sales occurred entirely in the place of delivery.see a,d.adopting as its premise that due process requires an seller to maintain minimum contacts with a state before the state can subject it to taxation,see quill north dakota,d,the district court found that the pact act mandate that delivery sellers pay state taxes without regard to their contact with that state effectively legislate d the due process requirement out of the equation.red earth llc united states,d.the district court left undisturbed the remainder of the pact act,including its and provisions.the district court further concluded that plaintiffs failed to show a likelihood of success as to their equal protection claims,and that they lacked standing to bring a tenth amendment claim.the government appeals,and plaintiffs,from that order.

we review a district court entry of preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.green party state bd.of elections,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when its decision is arbitrary or is based on an error of law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.almontaser city dep t of,cir per curiam.to obtain a preliminary injunction,the moving party must demonstrate irreparable harm absent injunctive relief either a likelihood of success on the merits,or a serious question going to the merits to make them a fair ground for trial,with a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the plaintiff favor and that the public interest weighs in favor of granting an injunction.metro.taxicab bd.of trade city of new york,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.when,as here,the preliminary injunction will affect government action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme,it should be granted only if the moving party meets the more rigorous standard.id.quoting county of nassau leavitt,cir.

i.the government appeal 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment places limits on a state ability to tax vendors.principally,due process requires some definite link,some minimum connection,between a state and the person,property or transaction it seeks to tax.miller.maryland.for purposes of a delivery seller obligation to comply with state tax laws,the pact act creates the fiction that every delivery sale occurs entirely within the specific state and place where the tobacco product is delivered.a.this action raises the question of whether congress can,consistent with constitutional due process,require a vendor to submit to the taxing jurisdiction of any state into which it makes at least one sale,without regard to the extent of that vendor contact with the state.
the district court,relying on quill north dakota,d,and applying the preliminary injunction standard,concluded that congress most likely can not do so.in quill,the supreme court overruled its previous due process holdings to the extent they indicated that the due process clause requires physical presence in a state for the imposition of duty to collect a use tax.id.at.years earlier,the supreme court had refused to obliterate the sharp distinction between mail order sellers with retail outlets,solicitors,or property within a state,who could be subject to state taxes,and those who do no more than communicate with customers in the state by mail or common carrier as part of a general interstate business,who could not.bellas hess,dep t of r
