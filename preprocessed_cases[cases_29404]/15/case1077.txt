in a class action accusing a federally chartered savings association of committing unfair business practices,the trial court found that federal law preempts the plaintiffs claim and entered judgment in favor of the defendant.the plaintiffs appeal.finding that the trial court belief that the action was preempted was mistaken and that the defendant has not demonstrated any other ground on which to affirm the judgment,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
in april of,harry gibson and joyce gibson,on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated,sued world savings and loan association.in substance,the complaint alleges that the potential class members are borrowers under secured loans made or serviced by world that those borrowers failed to maintain hazard insurance on the real property securing the loans that although it was entitled to simply reinstate the borrowers insurance policies,world purchased replacement hazard insurance forced order insurance or foi from an insurer of its own choice that those foi policies were much more expensive than the borrowers policies that world benefited financially from purchasing the more expensive policies and that by charging the borrowers for the full price of the foi policies,world violated the terms of the borrowers deeds of trust,which authorized world to advance funds on behalf of the borrowers only to the extent necessary to protect world rights.on the basis of those allegations,the complaint prays for relief on the theories of breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,unfair business practices,conversion,unjust enrichment,and declaratory relief.
in august of,the plaintiffs dismissed all claims except that for injunctive relief and restitution under the unfair competition law business and professions code section,et ucl for world allegedly unfair business practices.thereafter,the plaintiffs abandoned their claim for injunctive relief.accordingly,the issues presented by plaintiffs at trial were whether world foi charges violated the ucl and,if so,the amount of the restitution to be ordered.by that time,the plaintiffs had abandoned any challenge to world decision to buy foi policies rather than to reinstate the plaintiffs less expensive policies.instead,they argued that the amounts world charged to the plaintiffs for foi were too high because they included the cost both of replacement hazard insurance and of administrative services provided to world by the foi insurer.they also argued that world had falsely represented that the foi premiums charged to the plaintiffs were equal to the real cost of that insurance to world.in response,world contended that the plaintiffs contentions are preempted by federal law,that the plaintiffs challenge to foi premiums can only be resolved by the california department of insurance cdi,that its practices are not unfair or deceptive,and that restitution is not a proper remedy.
the trial court found that world is a federally chartered savings association and that it purchases foi from balboa insurance company.the premium charged to world by balboa includes,not only the cost of the replacement hazard insurance,but also the administrative costs associated with tracking hazard insurance coverage.moreover,the defaulting borrowers were not charged merely for those tracking services relating to their particular loans.instead,the premiums compensated balboa for tracking world entire loan portfolio,including loans to which the foi program could not apply.
the trial court concluded,however,that the plaintiffs challenge to world practice of charging its defaulting borrowers for the entire bundle of services provided to it by balboa is preempted by federal law.were it not preempted from doing so,the court said,it would have found that,by charging its defaulting borrowers an insurance premium that includes unrelated tracking costs that benefit only world,world had violated the terms of the plaintiffs deeds of trust and had engaged in unfair business practices under business and professions code section.
in accordance with its finding of preemption,the trial court entered judgment in favor of world.the plaintiffs appeal.
contentions 
the plaintiffs and an amicus curiae on their behalf,the california attorney general,contend that the trial court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs challenge to world foi practices is preempted by federal law.world and an amicus curiae in support of its position,the federal office of thrift supervision,dispute that contention.in addition,world and a second amicus curiae on its behalf,the western league of savings institutions league,contend that,not only is the action preempted,but even if it were not,judgment in its favor would still be required.in particular,they argue that the judgment should be affirmed because the plaintiffs claim is within the primary jurisdiction of the california department of insurance cdi the matter is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the insurance commissioner the claim is barred by the filed rate doctrine the plaintiffs are improperly seeking damages rather than restitution world foi practices are not unfair and the enforcement of the claim would constitute improper microeconomic regulation of business.
a.the plaintiffs claims are not federally preempted.the law of federal preemption in general.
the federal constitution directs that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.state laws can be contrary to,and thus preempted by,federal law in either of two general ways.if congress evidences an intent to occupy a given field,any state law falling within that field is.citations.if congress has not entirely displaced state regulation over the matter in question,state law is still to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law,that is,when it is impossible to comply with both state and federal law,citations,or where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of congress.silkwood,d.
it will not be presumed that a federal statute was intended to supersede the exercise of the power of the state unless there is a clear manifestation of intention to do so.new york of social services dublino,d,quoting schwartz texas.accordingly,w hether federal law preempts state law is fundamentally a question whether congress has intended such a result.peatros bank of america cal th,d.congressional intent to preempt may be either express or implied,either explicitly stated in the statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,d.however,courts are generally reluctant to infer preemption exxon governor of maryland,d.
preemption may result,not only from action taken by congress itself,but also from action by a federal agency.louisiana public service com,d.a regulation preemptive effect does not depend on express congressional authorization to displace state law.fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,supra,at.instead,the determinative issues are whether the agency intended its regulation to have a preemptive effect and the agency acted within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority by issuing the preemptive regulation.ibid.so long as those conditions are met,f ederal regulations have no less effect than federal statutes.

the hola,the ots,and its regulations.
federally chartered savings associations are regulated by the home owners loan act hola,codified in title of the united states code,beginning with section.as amended,the hola creates the office of thrift supervision ots a and authorizes its director to issue regulations prescribing the operation of federal savings associations according to the best practices of thrift institutions in the united states,a.
pursuant to that authority,the predecessor to the ots promulgated code of federal regulations section section,which provides the regulations of this part are promulgated pursuant to the plenary and exclusive authority of the ots to regulate all aspects of the operations of federal savings associations,as set forth in section a of the hola.this exercise of the ots authority is preemptive of any state law purporting to address the subject of the operations of a federal savings association.
in,the ots issued code of federal regulations section section to address preemption specifically in the context of lending operations.section states that the ots hereby occupies the entire field of lending regulation for federal savings associations,thereby permitting federal savings associations to extend credit without regard to state laws purporting to regulate or otherwise affect their credit activities,except to the extent provided in paragraph c of this section a.it illustrates the scope of the preemption by listing various examples of the types of requirements that are within the field of exclusive regulation b and then specifying the types of laws that are outside that field c 
unfair competition law claims are not preempted by section.
it is well established in california that claims for relief under the ucl and related state laws are not preempted by section.
for instance,in fenning glenfed,th,d,the plaintiff alleged that a federal savings association had engaged in deceptive business practices and sought relief for violation of the ucl,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation,d.the court rejected the savings association assertion that the plaintiffs claims were preempted by section,explaining that the bank argument that,by permitting fraud and unfair trade practices suits,the state is regulating the bank conduct,is off the mark.plaintiffs ability to sue the bank for fraud does not interfere with what the bank may do,that is,how it may conduct its operations it simply insists that the bank can not misrepresent how it operates,or employ fraudulent methods in its operations.put another way,the state can not dictate to the bank how it can or can not operate,but it can insist that,however the banks chooses to operate,it do so free from fraud and other deceptive business practices.fenning,d.

the plaintiffs ucl claims are not preempted by section.
the plaintiffs contend that,just as section did not preempt the ucl actions described above,the preemption defined by section does not extend to their action to recover restitution under the ucl for unfair or deceptive business practices.the attorney general of california supports that contention as an amicus curiae.it is disputed by world and the ots,appearing as an amicus curiae on behalf of world.
before beginning our exploration of their respective arguments,we make two preliminary observations.
first,as with any other issue arising under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,our analysis start s with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superseded by federal act unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.cipollone liggett group,d,quoting rice santa fe elevator.the states historic police powers include the regulation of consumer protection in general and of the banking and insurance industries in particular.smiley citibank cal th,d,century ins.garamendi cal th,d.therefore,there is a strong presumption cipollone.that section does not preempt the claims brought in this action.to overcome that presumption against preemption,world bears the burden of establishing that the claims are preempted.perdue crocker national bank cal d.
second,no issue of implied preemption is before us.when congress adopts legislation that includes a provision expressly addressing the issue of preemption,there is no need to infer congressional intent.cipollone liggett group,supra,at.congress enactment of a provision defining the reach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are not.ibid.the same reasoning applies here,where the express statement of preemptive intent is included in an administrative regulation rather than a statute.the question,therefore,is whether the scope of the express preemption extends to the claims at issue here.
no preemption under cipollone liggett group.
the method by which the scope of preemption is determined was explained by the united states supreme court when it decided the preemptive effect of the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act.cipollone liggett group,supra,at.since then,the same method has been applied by california courts both in that context mangini reynolds tobacco cal th,d,and in others see,etcheverry service,cal th,d,federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act.we must fairly light of the strong presumption against construe the precise language of the preemptive statute or regulation and we must look to each of the plaintiffs state law claims to determine whether it is in fact.mangini,d,quoting cipollone.as to each state law claim,the central inquiry is whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the claims constitutes a requirement or prohibition of the sort that federal law expressly preempts.cipollone.etcheverry,d,mangini,d.
the plaintiffs claim that world foi practice was an unfair business practice because the premium charged by world to the borrower was higher than the cost of that insurance to world,in violation of the terms of the deeds of trust between the plaintiffs and world,which entitled world to advance only such sums as were necessary to protect its security.they also claim that the practice was a fraudulent business practice because world misrepresented the cost of the replacement hazard insurance.the trial court found both claims to be true.
those claims are predicated on the duties of a contracting party to comply with its contractual obligations and to act reasonably to mitigate its damages in the event of a breach by the other party,on the duty not to misrepresent material facts,and on the duty to refrain from unfair or deceptive business practices.
those predicate duties are not requirements or prohibitions of the sort that section preempts.that section preempts state laws that either purport to regulate federal savings associations or otherwise materially affect their credit activities.the predicate duties underlying the plaintiffs claims do not meet that description.
the plaintiffs principal complaint concerns the violation of contractual duties.contractual duties are voluntarily undertaken by the parties to the contract,not imposed by state law.cipollone liggett group,supra,at.a stated intent to preempt requirements or prohibitions imposed by state law does not reasonably extend to those voluntarily assumed in a contract.
moreover,none of the predicate duties are directed toward federal savings associations.instead,the duties on which the plaintiffs claims are predicated govern,not simply the lending business,but anyone engaged in any business and anyone contracting with anyone else.on their face,they do not purport to regulate federal savings associations and are not specifically directed toward them.nor is there any evidence that
