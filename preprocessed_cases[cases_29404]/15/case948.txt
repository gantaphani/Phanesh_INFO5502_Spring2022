introduction 
petitioner paul fontaine obtained a loan for personal,family or household use from real party in interest cashcall,hereafter cashcall.after cashcall attempted to collect the debt,fontaine filed a complaint in santa clara county superior court alleging that the collection methods used by cashcall and four of its employees violated the rosenthal fair debt collections practices act,et.cashcall responded by bringing a motion to transfer the action to orange county superior court on the ground that individual defendant richard vargas,a resident of orange county,had requested that the case be tried there.the trial court granted the motion and ordered the action transferred to orange county superior court.
fontaine seeks extraordinary relief from the trial court order,arguing that venue is proper in santa clara county pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b because he resides in santa clara county and the action arises from a consumer loan.for the reasons stated below,we agree and therefore we will issue a peremptory writ in the first instance vacating the trial court order.
ii.factual and procedural background 
in his complaint filed on may,fontaine alleges that defendant cashcall and its employees,individual defendants richard vargas,james ryan,ronald bey,and rachel behn,engaged in abusive and intrusive conduct in an attempt to collect a debt.fontaine became indebted when he incurred a financial obligation to cashcall that was primarily incurred for personal,family or household purposes he asserts that cashcall repeatedly and continuously made telephone calls and sent collection letters that were intended to annoy,abuse and harass him.based on these and other allegations,the complaint includes causes of action for violation of the rosenthal fair debt collections practices act et,invasion of privacy,negligent infliction of emotional distress,negligence,and violation of the telephone consumer protection act,subd.b a.
defendants cashcall,vargas,and bey subsequently brought a motion to transfer the action to orange county superior court.they argued that venue was proper in orange county because the general venue rule set forth in section,subdivision a provides that a defendant is entitled to have an action tried in the county of his or her residence vargas was a resident of orange county and requested that the action be transferred there and there was no applicable exception to the general venue rule.
fontaine opposed the motion on the ground that venue was proper in santa clara county under two exceptions to the general venue rule.first,fontaine claimed that he had suffered physical and emotional injury in santa clara county due to defendants unlawful debt collection activities,and therefore the action could be tried in santa clara county pursuant to section,subdivision a.second,fontaine asserted that venue was proper in santa clara county under section,subdivision b because the action arose from a loan that he had obtained primarily for personal,family or household purposes and he was a resident of santa clara county at the time the action was filed.fontaine filed a declaration in support of his opposition,in which he also stated that he was financially unable to travel to the location of the orange county superior court.
at the hearing on the motion to transfer,held on november,the trial court granted the motion.the court rejected both of fontaine venue arguments,determining that the action was not a physical injury action for purposes of venue and that section,subdivision b did not apply because fontaine action was not a collection action.the trial court order transferring the action to orange county superior court,upon plaintiff payment of court costs,was entered on december.defendants served a notice of entry of order on january.
fontaine filed a petition for writ of mandamus in this court on january,in which he sought extraordinary relief from the trial court order.on march,we issued a palma notice palma industrial fasteners,cal d,advising the parties that this court was considering issuing a peremptory writ of mandate in the first instance,requesting points and authorities in opposition to the petition,and allowing petitioner to reply.having received opposition to the petition for writ of mandamus and petitioner reply,we turn to the merits of the writ petition.
iii.discussion 
fontaine argues that the trial court erroneously ruled that section,subdivision b does not apply to an action in which a consumer sues a debt collector.he explains that section,subdivision b expressly provides that where,as here,the action arises from the extension of credit for personal,family,or household use,venue is proper where the borrower resided at the time the action was commenced.
real parties in interest hereafter defendants maintain that fontaine interpretation of section,subdivision b is wrong.they believe that section,subdivision b does not apply to this action because it is not a collection action against fontaine.in their words,it is clear that section b is a shield for consumer defendants who have been sued in certain collection actions it is not a sword for consumer plaintiffs who seek to assert claims for alleged unfair debt collection activities against individual defendants in distant forums.alternatively,defendants assert that the venue exception provided by section,subdivision b does not apply here because fontaine action does not arise from the provision of a consumer loan by individual defendant vargas.
we will begin our analysis with an overview of the procedure for a motion to transfer an action.
