in this diversity removal case involving a claim of a defect in an automobile,the district court adopted the purchase price of the car as the overriding factor in assessing the jurisdictional amount in controversy.no allowance was made for the value of the car with the defect,nor was any reduction made for the plaintiff use of the vehicle.finding the record inadequate for determining the amount in controversy,we will remand for further proceedings.
the plaintiff purchased a model year kia sephia automobile on october.dissatisfied with the performance of the car,she filed a class action against the manufacturer,kia,in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county,pennsylvania on january.the complaint alleges that because of a design defect in the braking system,plaintiff returned the car for repairs on five separate occasions between january,and august.in four instances,the brake rotors and pads had to be replaced even though the vehicle had been driven less than miles.
despite her requests for rescission of the purchase contract,or correction of the braking problem,she asserts the defendant failed to meet its obligations.the complaint asks for certification of a class consisting of pennsylvania residents who purchased or leased kia sephia model automobiles in the years before she filed the suit.
the defendant removed the case to the eastern district of pennsylvania on february,asserting diversity between the parties and an amount in controversy exceeding.the district court denied the plaintiff motion to remand,rejecting her assertion that she did not seek damages in excess of.kia motors,supp.
following further proceedings,the court certified a class consisting of residents of pennsylvania who purchased or leased model years kia sephia automobiles for personal,family or household purposes.kia motors.pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,we granted defendant petition to appeal the class certification order.
jurisdiction 
rule f provides that a court of appeals,in its discretion,may permit an appeal from an order of the district court granting class certification.the scope of this review is a narrow one.see mckowan lowe,jasmine,cir the advisory committee notes explicitly describe rule f as not extending to any other type of order,even where that order has some impact on another portion of rule.
although the appeal in this case is limited to the certification issue,we are obliged to examine subject matter jurisdiction.generally speaking,an interlocutory order on jurisdiction per se by the district court is not appealable.harrison nissan motor.in usa,cir.however,the fact that review under rule f is restricted does not relieve the court from the duty of inquiry into its jurisdiction.see,bender williamsport area sch,d mitchell maurer.employers ins.of wausau crown cork seal,cir.even if the parties have not raised the issue,a court of appeals should examine its authority sua sponte during its review of the case.see,medlin boeing vertol,cir kessler,cir judgment vacated for lack of jurisdiction after three appeals on various issues.
in the case before us,the parties did not brief the amount in controversy,but did address the subject in supplemental submissions filed in response to our request.however,the parties would have us address the certification issue before scrutinizing subject matter jurisdiction.in amchem products,windsor,d,the supreme court concluded that because the class certification rulings were dispositive as to all parties it would address them first rather than the jurisdictional challenges.some of the amchem class members unquestionably satisfied the jurisdictional monetary floor.thus,the certification issues common to all were logically antecedent and merited priority because they applied to all members of the class,whereas the question as to the amount in controversy concerned only some of the members.
the circumstances here are quite different and we will follow the usual sequence of looking first to subject matter jurisdiction,which in this case is based on diversity of citizenship.our standard of review is plenary.packard provident bank,cir.
removal of cases from state to federal courts is governed by.in diversity suits,the requirement of an amount in controversy exceeding applies to removed cases as well as to litigation filed originally in the federal court.c requires that,in removed cases,i f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.
in meritcare paul mercury insurance,cir,we reviewed many of our opinions addressing the amount in controversy issue.therefore,we will only briefly summarize the principles set forth in that case.it is important to bear in mind that parties may not confer subject matter jurisdiction by consent.see,united states griffin.liberty mut.ins.ward trucking,cir united indus.workers gov t of the virgin islands,cir.
is to be strictly construed against removal,boyer tools,cir,so that the congressional intent to restrict federal diversity jurisdiction is honored.this policy has always been rigorously enforced by the courts.paul mercury indem.red cab.
ii.standard of review 
the party asserting jurisdiction bears the burden of showing that at all stages of the litigation the case is properly before the federal court.see packard,at.articulation of the standard to be applied and the extent of the burden to meet that requirement have caused some disparity in district court opinions within this circuit.
in irving allstate indemnity,supp,the district court explained that c ourts in the third circuit are unencumbered by consistency in their characterization of a defendant burden of proving the amount in controversy on a motion to remand.in that case,the preponderance of the evidence standard was used 
other courts have used a reasonable probability test,which requires the defendant to show that a reasonable jury likely could value the plaintiff losses at over.chaparro state farm ins,wl,at.in international fleet auto sales,national auto credit agency,wl,at,the district court equated the reasonable probability standard to the legal certainty approach.several district courts have applied the legal certainty standard.see,mcdonough crum forster pers,wl,at 
the middle district of pennsylvania has employed a process involving both parties.see orndorff allstate ins,adopting the approach taken by de aguilar boeing,cir.under this formula,if the defendant establishes a basis for asserting that the requisite amount in controversy has been met,the plaintiff must then prove to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount in order to support remand.id.
other versions have included the district court make s an independent appraisal of the value of the claim,neff motors,citing angus shiley,cir bishop motors,utilizing a similar standard adoption of the inverted legal certainty approach,in which the defendant must prove to a legal certainty that the plaintiff damages are not less than,ditullio universal underwriters ins,wl,at and remanding a case because ambiguity exists and doubt remains regarding the sufficiency of the amount in controversy.stuessy microsoft.
many of the variations are purely semantical and we have found no case where the result would have been different had one of the variations described been used.however,we think it would be helpful if consistent language were used by the district courts within this circuit.
the supreme court has discussed the nature of a defendant burden of proof in a removal case.in paul mercury indemnity red cab.the plaintiff,in seeking a remand to the state court,amended the complaint after removal to allege damages less than the federal jurisdictional amount.the court stated that the rule for determining whether the case involves the requisite amount as whether from the face of the pleadings,it is apparent,to a legal certainty,that the plaintiff can not recover the amount claimed,or if,from the proofs,the court is satisfied to a like certainty that the plaintiff never was entitled to recover that amount.id.at.if not,the suit must be dismissed.
some courts have found inconsistencies between red cab and mcnutt general motors acceptance of indiana.in the latter case,the supreme court held that the party alleging jurisdiction must justify his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.mcnutt,at.in that case,although a challenge to the amount in controversy had been raised in the pleadings,no evidence or findings in the trial court addressed that issue.in that respect,red cab differs because these factual findings had been made.
rather than reading articulations of the standard as variations,we believe that the holdings in these two cases may be reconciled.in many instances the amount in controversy will be determined in whole or in part by state law.for example,if state law denies recovery for punitive damages,the federal court would be required to disregard the value of such a claim asserted to be included within the jurisdictional amount.see packard,at.in deciding applicable state law,the preponderance of the evidence standard would have no utility.
in many cases,however,disputes over factual matters may be involved.in resolving those issues,the mcnutt preponderance of the evidence standard would be appropriate once findings of fact have been made,the court may determine whether red cab legal certainty test for jurisdiction has been met.
in short,despite the use by some courts of such phrases as more likely than not,substantial likelihood,and reasonable probability,we recommend that when the relevant facts are not in dispute or findings have been made the district courts adhere to the legal certainty test cited in such cases as meritcare,packard,bloom barry,cir and nelson keefer,cir.
we recognize that requiring a defendant to show to a legal certainty that the amount in controversy exceeds the statutory minimum may lead to somewhat bizarre situations.as the court observed in shaw dow brands,cir,oral argument presented a comic scene plaintiff personal injury lawyer protests up and down that his client injuries are as minor and insignificant as can be,while attorneys for the manufacturer paint a sob story about how plaintiff life has been wrecked.it would not be a surprise that when the time came for assessment of damages the parties would once again switch their views by some degrees.
because of the manner in which the claims for damages were stated in the complaint here,the district court was required to apply state law in converting the categories to monetary sums.see horton liberty mut.ins,d in diversity cases courts must look to state law to determine the nature and extent of the right to be enforced.in fairness to the district court,our review of the record indicates that the parties did not provide much assistance in this endeavor.
having concluded that the legal certainty test is appropriate,we turn to the jurisdictional problem.in her motion to remand,plaintiff contended that the complaint filed in the state court established that her claims did not meet the required amount of.although this was the plaintiffs clearly stated position,it did not resolve the jurisdictional issue because the defendant has a right to resort to a federal forum if it can establish that the jurisdictional requirements have been satisfied.see,red cab,at.
iii.scope of damages 
in removal cases,determining the amount in controversy begins with a reading of the complaint filed in the state court.unlike many instances in which a specific amount is requested,the ad damnum clause in this complaint is stated in terms of categories of damages.because the diversity statute speaks in terms of dollars,we must translate the categories plaintiff cites into monetary sums.
count i of the complaint alleges that the defendant violated the pennsylvania unfair trade practices and consumer protection law the consumer protection law.stat.ann.tit.a west.the statute allows recovery of actual damages and reasonable attorneys fees,treble damages and such additional relief as the court deems necessary or proper.id.because this claim offers the highest potential recovery to the plaintiff,we will discuss it first.
the plaintiff sought damages for loss of value of the car,depreciation in resale value,repair costs,expense of repair attempts,loss of use,treble damages,and attorneys fees.in the alternative,she sought to rescind the contract.
in calculating the damages recoverable under the statute,the district court began with the base purchase price of the automobile,and added registration,title and filing fees,sales tax,service contract cost and expenses of financing to reach a total of,d at.the court concluded that giving the damages claims the broadest possible reading and trebling the which plaintiff is obligated to pay for her automobile over five years in addition to attorneys fees and expenses,would clearly total an amount in excess of.id.the district court did not explain the computation underlying its conclusion.
the consumer protection law does not specify how actual damages should be measured and we therefore turn to relevant state appellate rulings.the pennsylvania supreme court has not yet had the occasion to interpret the statutory term.the superior court,an intermediate appellate court,has utilized the purchase price of a vehicle as a starting point for calculating damages.from that amount,various sums have been deducted to arrive at the actual damages.see stokes gary barbera,young dart.
in stokes,the plaintiff proved that the car dealer had tampered with the odometer and misrepresented that a van was new.stokes,at.in determining the damage award,the trial court began with the amount of monthly payments made by the plaintiff and added the down payment,the value of the and the amount necessary to pay off the loan.id.at.from this total the following amounts were subtracted half of the monthly payments the plaintiff had made to reflect usage,an additional for usage and a credit that the plaintiff received for the van when he purchased a new car.id.the superior court affirmed.id.at.
in young dart,the plaintiff purchased a car from a dealer who concealed the fact that the vehicle had been involved in a collision and had numerous hidden defects.young,at.recognizing that the consumer protection law does not set forth a formula for the assessment of actual damages,the superior court held that the trial court did not err by looking to the method used under the automobile lemon law.see id.at.see also.stat.ann.tit.west.the trial court used the purchase price as a starting point,and subtracted for young usage between the date of purchase and the trial,as well as requiring the return of the car.young,at.the plaintiff was also awarded some minor consequential damages.
in suber chrysler,cir,we were faced with somewhat similar issues under the new jersey consumer fraud act.in that case,we remanded for reevaluation of the plaintiff loss under the state lemon law.id.at.the district court in suber began and ended its analysis with the sticker price of the van.we noted that under the lemon law a claimant was required to return the car and that because the value of the vehicle had not been established,the issue should be reviewed on remand.id.at.we recognize that in discussing damages,suber was applying new jersey law,not the pennsylvania consumer protection law,and,hence,is not determinative here.
in werwinski ford motor,cir,the panel concluded that defendant had established removal jurisdiction in a case where the plaintiffs complained that their automobile had a defective transmission.the court pointed out that the plaintiffs sought to recover compensatory damages and in addition all or part of the sums plaintiffs paid to purchase or lease their automobiles.id.at.moreover,plaintiffs demanded that the defendant disgorge its profits received from the sale of the subject vehicles make full restitution.id.at.the court concluded,because of these provisions,the complaint clearly leaves the door open for them later to demand reimbursement for the purchase price of the cars.id.
we observe that in the briefs in that case the parties cited four district court opinions and did not call the panel attention to the two superior court cases interpret
