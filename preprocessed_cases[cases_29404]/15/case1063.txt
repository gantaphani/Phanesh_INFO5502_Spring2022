in this mandamus proceeding,we hold that where a private plaintiff which has itself suffered no injury files a representative action under california unfair competition law ucl bus,et alleging that certain of defendant contractual provisions subject its customers to an unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practice and the contract contains a forum selection provision,the plaintiff is bound by that provision just as defendant customers would be bound had they filed the action themselves.
facts and procedural history 
provides internet telecommunication services,commonly known as telephony services,that allow a computer user to place phone calls over the internet,either to another computer or to a regular telephone.has a worldwide customer base,but its principal place of business is in new jersey.customers who wish to utilize services must download software from website.the software has links to an end user license agreement and terms of use.the customer must accept both in order to use the software.also offers a direct calling card,also purchased via website,that enables customers to use a regular telephone to make a call that is carried through the internet and then switched back to a local telephone network.according to,both services allow customers to make long distance calls for substantially less than current rates for traditional calling methods.the terms of use hyperlink appears on each page of the website.language on the website advises the user that in order to access the site,he or she must agree to be bound by the terms of use.the pertinent language concludes if you do not wish to be bound by these terms of use,you may not access or use the site,materials,or any of the services.by using the materials or service,you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of use.
consumer cause,contends failure to disclose in its advertising and promotional materials its billing practice of rounding up to the nearest minute that is,charging for its services in increments regardless of use time renders promotional materials and advertising false,misleading and fraudulent in violation of business and professions code section.consumer cause further contends failure to disclose its billing practices except in its terms of use and end user license agreement,which are accessed via highlighted hyperlink,constitutes an unfair business practice under the ucl.it seeks an injunction,restitution and attorney fees.
the end user license agreement and terms of use contain clauses providing that disputes arising under the contract shall be governed by new jersey law.the clauses further provide any dispute between you and regarding this agreement will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the state of new jersey.you agree to submit to exclusive jurisdiction in the state of new jersey,and you expressly waive all defenses to jurisdiction.
citing these forum selection provisions,filed a motion to stay or dismiss the action.code civ,subd.a.consumer cause opposed the motion,arguing it should not be bound by the forum selection clause in the contract because it was neither a party to the contract nor closely related to those who were.consumer cause further argued that its ucl claim was exempt from the forum selection clause because had failed to demonstrate that new jersey was a suitable alternative forum for the action unlike the ucl,which permits a plaintiff who himself has not suffered any injury to bring an action on behalf of the general public,new jersey consumer fraud act to permits only an injured party or the attorney general to file such an action.
respondent court found that consumer cause was not bound by the forum selection clause in user agreement because consumer cause was acting as a private attorney general,and had the real attorney general brought this action,i would doubt if this court would be sending him to new jersey to try the matter.the court ruled that consumer cause could pursue this action in california,but the action would be governed by new jersey law.
we agree with respondent court that an unfair competition action brought by a public prosecutor would not be subject to the forum selection clause.this is because of the fundamentally different nature of an action brought by a prosecutor and privately pursued representative actions.see payne national collection systems,th,d.although the label private attorney general is often used or misused to describe a private plaintiff in a ucl action,respondent court construed the term too literally.the filing of a ucl action by a private plaintiff does not confer on that plaintiff the stature of a prosecuting officer,and the fact that the plaintiff may be acting as a private attorney general is irrelevant for purposes of the issue presented here.the relevant inquiry in determining whether a plaintiff,not a party to a contract,is bound by the contract forum selection clause is whether the third party is closely related to the contractual relationship,and the contractual forum state in this case,new jersey provides a suitable alternative forum for the lawsuit.both requirements are met here.
discussion 
both the united states supreme court and the california supreme court have recognized that f orum selection clauses play an important role in both national and interstate commerce.lu of california,th,d,citing bremen zapata,d smith,valentino smith,superior court cal d,at.such clauses provide a degree of certainty,both for businesses and their customers,that contractual disputes will be resolved in a particular forum.carnival cruise lines,shute,d.california courts routinely enforce forum selection clauses even where the chosen forum is far from the plaintiff residence.see,intershop communications ag superior court th,d hamburg,germany,forum cql original products,national hockey league players th,d ontario,canada,forum.
when a forum selection clause appears in a contract entered into freely and voluntarily by parties who have negotiated at arm length,forum selection clauses are valid and may be given effect,in the court discretion and in the absence of a showing that enforcement of such a clause would be unreasonable.smith,valentino smith,superior court cal d.this rule accords with ancient concepts of freedom of contract and reflects an appreciation of the expanding horizons of american contractors who seek business in all parts of the world.bremen zapata,d.
a forum selection clause may also be enforced against a plaintiff who is not a party to the contract in question if the plaintiff is closely related to the contractual relationship.the plaintiff challenging the forum selection clause has the burden of showing,in response to a defendant motion to stay or dismiss,that enforcement of the clause would be unreasonable under the circumstances.lu of california,supra,th at,d.
consumer cause is closely related to the contract between and its customers.
as a threshold matter,we find that the forum selection clause would be enforceable had customers filed this action themselves.we perceive no unfairness in requirement that certain contractual terms must be accessed via hyperlink,a common practice in internet business.the fact that the forum selection clause may have been a take it or leave it proposition,and not vigorously bargained for as consumer cause contends,does not make the clause unenforceable.carnival cruise lines,shute,supra,at.
although consumer cause is not itself a party to the contract,it has sued in a representative capacity challenging certain contractual terms.by so doing,consumer cause purports to assert the rights of those who are parties to the contract.if it prevails,consumer cause will succeed in altering the terms of the contract,and reap the fruits of victory including attorney fees.consumer cause is closely related to the contractual relationship because it stands in the shoes of those whom it purports to represent.its argument to the contrary is inconsistent with its position as a representative plaintiff.were we to hold otherwise,a plaintiff could avoid a valid forum selection clause simply by having a representative file the action.see lu,supra,th at,d.
in lu,a franchisor corporate parent was found to be closely related to the contractual relationship between the franchisor and its franchisee,because the franchisor was alleged to have participated in the fraudulent misrepresentations that induced the plaintiff to enter into the franchise agreement.consumer cause correctly points out that the case is factually distinguishable on that basis.however,the plaintiff in lu also alleged that the parent was the alter ego of the franchisor that signed the franchise agreement in other words,for purposes of the lawsuit,the two were one and the same.the position of consumer cause,the representative plaintiff,is similar in that respect.
bancomer,superior court th,d,cited by consumer cause in its return to the petition,is distinguishable.that case involved a bank that had no relationship to the contractual dispute other than being thrust into a position as trustee,and which was attempting to enforce,not defeat,a forum selection clause.unlike consumer cause,the bank in that case had nothing to gain from resolution of the contractual dispute.
america online,superior court th,d,cited by consumer cause,is also factually distinguishable.in that case,a class action filed pursuant to the california consumers legal remedies act crla,et,the court held a forum selection clause invalid because the crla contains a provision that voids any purported waiver of rights as being contrary to california public policy.the ucl,under which consumer cause brought this action,contains no such limitation.
new jersey is a suitable alternate forum.
the consumer fraud act cfa,to,is similar in many ways to the ucl.however,it differs from the ucl in one crucial respect an action under the cfa must be filed by either the attorney general or a ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of moneys or property because consumer cause has itself suffered no ascertainable loss from alleged unlawful business practices,it argues that enforcement of the forum selection clause would be unreasonable because it would not have standing to bring this action in new jersey.
although the new jersey legislature has not seen fit to confer on private parties who are not injured the right to bring a representative action on behalf of those who are,this does not necessarily mean that new jersey does not provide the means to protect injured consumers.any customer of who claims to have been injured by billing practices may bring an action in new jersey,or may prevail on the attorney general of new jersey to do so.significantly,consumer cause does not claim customers would not be adequately protected were they required to pursue their claims in new jersey.instead,consumer cause has focused only in its own lack of standing.while it is true that consumer cause stands to lose the opportunity to recover attorney fees should it prevail in a california ucl action,our paramount consideration is the protection of consumers,not the enrichment of attorneys.
disposition 
the petition for writ of mandate is granted.a peremptory writ shall issue directing respondent court to vacate its order of october,denying the motion of defendant to stay or dismiss the action,and enter a new and different order granting the motion to stay.costs are awarded to.
i respectfully dissent.
a trial court decision to enforce or not enforce a forum selection clause is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.bancomer,superior court th,d but see business products services,ricoh th,d test.for the following reasons,i do not believe the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to enforce the forum selection clauses in this case.
the new jersey forum selection clause in the contracts between defendant,and various consumers is not applicable or enforceable as to claims brought by plaintiff consumer cause,consumer cause under california unfair competition law bus,et ucl the enforcement of such forum selection clauses to divest california of private attorney general cases under the ucl is contrary to california public policy.if such clauses are enforceable,private attorney general actions under california regulatory statutes could be frustrated.in addition,the plaintiff is not a party to any contract with the claims are statutory,not contractual and new jersey is not a suitable alternative forum available to plaintiff.
public policy precludes enforcement of forum selection clauses under these circumstances.
california courts will refuse to defer to the selected forum if to do so would substantially diminish the rights of california residents in a way that violates our state public policy.america online,superior court th,d.enforcement of the forum selection clause here would substantially diminish the rights of california residents in contravention of public policy.
the ucl prohibits any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by chapter commencing with section of part of division of the business and professions code.the coverage of the ucl is sweeping,embracing anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.citations.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.a person defined to include a corporation who undertakes such conduct may be enjoined from engaging in the unfair business practice and ordered to pay restitution.
the primary purpose of the ucl is to preserve fair business competition by extending protections traditionally available to business competitors to the consuming public.rothschild tyco internat.us,th,d.the ucl reflects t he tendency of the law,both legislative and common in the direction of enforcing increasingly higher standards of fairness or commercial morality in trade.people ex rel.mosk national research d.accordingly,the ucl constitutes an important public policy of the state of california,notwithstanding recent allegations of abuses in its use.see stern,unfair business practices and false advertising bus.ed,referring to the ucl as a sprawling oak of consumer protection law.that public prosecutors in california must by california law be notified of ucl appellate proceedings in california so that they may participate is a further indication that the ucl reflects an important public policy of california.
in order to implement the important public policies of the ucl,the legislature provided that multiple parties had standing to sue to enforce the act.thus,rather than limiting enforcement of the ucl to aggrieved parties,the legislature specified that actions for relief under the ucl may be brought by state or local prosecutors in the name of the people of the state of california or by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public,italics added.accordingly,the ucl allows anyone to act as,in effect,a private attorney general to protect the public against certain commercial wrongs and deceptions.the ucl reflects the legislature conclusion that individual claims or class actions in california courts or actions by california public officials are not adequate to protect california consumers.to allow private parties to restrict the availability of relief under the ucl to that offered by the courts or public officials of another state conflicts with the broad means of enforcement of the ucl established by the california legislature.
that restriction is precisely the effect of the majority opinion enforcing the forum selection clauses and sending this action to new jersey.new jersey consumer fraud act,to,does not allow private attorney general actions such as that brought by consumer cause here.the majority opinion eviscerates the ucl by ordering the dispute to a jurisdiction that does not permit private attorneys general to prosecute a statutory unfair competition action.
contrary to the majority assertion,this is not an issue of the enrichment of attorneys.opn.ante,at.it is an issue of preserving the statutory scheme enacted by the legislature and of maintaining a means of enforcing the ucl important public policies.as this court recently observed,r epresentative ucl actions make it econo
