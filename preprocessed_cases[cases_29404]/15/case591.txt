defendants corinthian colleges,and related entities appeal the district court partial denial of their motion to compel arbitration.plaintiffs,former students at schools owned by corinthian,brought this putative class action on behalf of current and former students,alleging that corinthian engaged in a deceptive scheme to entice the enrollment of prospective students in violation of california law.pursuant to arbitration clauses in plaintiffs enrollment agreements,corinthian moved to compel arbitration.the district court granted the motion in part but denied the motion regarding plaintiffs claims for injunctive relief under california unfair competition law,false advertising law,and consumer legal remedies act.in doing so,the district court relied on decisions by the california supreme court establishing the broughton cruz rule,which exempts claims for public injunctive relief from arbitration.
based on decisions of the united states supreme court,including some rendered after the district court entered its order in this case and after the california supreme court decisions establishing the broughton cruz rule,we conclude that the broughton cruz rule is preempted by the federal arbitration act.we reverse that portion of the district court ruling.the district court is instructed to direct all of plaintiffs claims to arbitration and to stay the action pending arbitration.
background 
kevin ferguson is a graduate of everest institute of miami medical assistant program.he enrolled in the program in june and attended everest for approximately one year.he allegedly financed his education through federal student loans and,despite graduating with a strong academic record,was unable to find employment in the medical assistant field.
sandra muniz attended heald college in california in,and.after completing a business skills certificate,she enrolled in a paralegal program that she did not complete.she later enrolled in a criminal justice program.like ferguson,muniz alleged that she financed her education through student loans and was unable to find meaningful employment.
ferguson and muniz brought two separate putative class actions against corinthian,the parent company of the schools they attended.corinthian also owns and operates a number of other academic institutions nationwide,many operating under the names everest and heald.plaintiffs proposed class included all students in the united states and canada who enrolled in an everest school after approximately january,or a heald school after approximately january.the district court consolidated ferguson and muniz cases into the present action.
the thrust of plaintiffs complaints was that corinthian systematically misled prospective students in order to entice enrollment.corinthian allegedly misrepresented the quality of its education,its accreditation,the career prospects for its graduates,and the actual cost of education at one of its schools.students were also allegedly misinformed about financial aid,which resulted in student loans that many could not repay.corinthian also allegedly targeted veterans and military personnel specifically,so that it could receive funding through federal financial aid programs available to those people.
plaintiffs asserted seven claims under california law.at issue in this appeal are plaintiffs claims under california unfair competition law ucl,california business and professions code et false advertising law fal,california business and professions code et and consumer legal remedies act clra,california civil code et seq.plaintiffs sought both money damages and injunctive relief under those statutes.
plaintiffs enrollment agreements each contained an arbitration clause.additionally,ferguson signed an enrollment agreement addendum containing an arbitration clause,and muniz signed an agreement to binding arbitration and waiver of jury trial.based on those agreements,corinthian moved to compel arbitration of the entire action.
the district court granted the motion with respect to most of plaintiffs claims and stayed those claims pending arbitration.applying california broughton cruz rule,the court declined to compel arbitration of plaintiffs requests for injunctive relief under the ucl,fal,and clra,though it sent plaintiffs requests for damages under those statutes to arbitration.corinthian appealed that ruling.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court denial of a motion to compel arbitration.kilgore keybank,ass n,cir en banc.
a.the federal arbitration act 
the federal arbitration act faa provides that agreements to arbitrate are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.that statute reflects an emphatic federal policy in favor of arbitration.marmet health care,brown,d per curiam citation omitted.its purpose is to ensur e that private arbitration agreements are enforced.mortensen bresnan commc ns,llc,cir quoting at t mobility llc concepcion,d.
pursuant to the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,the faa preempts contrary state law.id.at.in enacting the faa,congress withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.southland keating,d.we are thus prohibited from applying any state statute that invalidates an arbitration agreement.allied bruce terminix,dobson,d.nor may we apply any other state law that prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim.concepcion.at.
corinthian argues that the faa preempts california broughton cruz rule.we agree.
b.the broughton cruz rule 
the broughton cruz rule began with the california supreme court decision in broughton cigna healthplans of california,cal th,d,cal.broughton involved claims by a minor and his mother against a health care company,cigna healthplans of california.id.at.the minor plaintiff suffered severe injuries at birth,which the plaintiffs alleged were caused by substandard prenatal medical care and the denial of a medically necessary cesarean delivery.id.in addition to asserting a medical malpractice claim,the plaintiffs alleged that cigna had violated the clra by deceptively and misleadingly advertising the quality of its medical services.id.they sought damages and an order enjoining cigna deceptive practices.see also kilgore,at summarizing broughton.
the clra,which is intended to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive business practices and to provide efficient and economical procedures to secure such protection,gives private parties the right to seek an order enjoining practices that violate it.broughton,d,at citations omitted see also cal.civil code.when a plaintiff exercises that right,it functions as a private attorney general,enjoining future deceptive practices on behalf of the general public.broughton,d,at.
because of an inherent conflict between arbitration and the purposes of the clra,the california supreme court held that arbitration could not be compelled for such claims for a public injunction.id.at.the california court identified two factors that create the conflict.first,public injunctions under the clra are for the benefit of the general public rather than the party bringing the action,and,second,the judicial forum has significant institutional advantages over arbitration in administering a public injunctive remedy,which as a consequence will likely lead to the diminution or frustration of the public benefit if the remedy is entrusted to arbitrators.id.
the california supreme court adopted the inherent conflict analysis from the united states supreme court.id.at.the united states supreme court had earlier explained that some statutory claims are not suitable for arbitration,and that suitability depends on congressional intent.mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,d.identifying an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute underlying purposes is one way of demonstrating that congress did not intend for claims brought under that statute to be arbitrated.gilmer lane,d quoting.express mcmahon,d.
in cruz pacificare health systems,cal th,d,cal,the california supreme court extended its holding in broughton to requests for public injunctive relief under the ucl and fal.under the ucl,any person engaged in unfair competition may be enjoined,and an action to enforce that statute may be brought by a public prosecutor or by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also cal.bus.the fal,which makes unlawful untrue or misleading statements designed to induce the purchase of goods and services,similarly authorizes the enjoining of such statements by members of the public.cruz,d,at citations omitted see also cal.bus.
this court applied the broughton cruz rule in davis myers,cir.davis involved an employee claims against her employer under various federal and california statutes,including the ucl.id.at.we held,among other things,that the arbitration agreement at issue could not prohibit,require arbitration of judicial actions seeking such public injunctive relief.id.at.to the extent it did so,the agreement was unenforceable.id.we did not,however,analyze whether that rule contravened the faa.
as prior circuit authority,davis is controlling absent any clearly irreconcilable intervening higher authority see miller gammie,cir en banc w here the reasoning or theory of our prior circuit authority is clearly irreconcilable with the reasoning or theory of intervening higher authority,a three judge panel should consider itself bound by the later and controlling authority,and should reject the prior circuit opinion as having been effectively overruled.see also rodriguez v.at t mobility servs.llc,wl,at cir.we conclude that the portion of davis applying the broughton cruz is clearly irreconcilable with subsequent united states supreme court decisions concerning the faa 
preemption by the federal arbitration act 
we turn first to at t mobility llc concepcion,d.in concepcion,the supreme court held that the faa preempted a california rule known as the discover bank rule which invalidated most class action waivers in adhesion contracts,including arbitration agreements,as unconscionable.id.at.of particular significance to this case is the court statement that w hen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim,the analysis is straightforward the conflicting rule is displaced by the faa.id.at.
this principle was reiterated in marmet health care center,brown,d per curiam,one of the decisions handed down after the district court order in this case.marmet involved a west virginia rule that invalidated any predispute agreement to arbitrate a personal injury or wrongful death claim against a nursing home.id.at.that rule arose from three negligence lawsuits each alleging the wrongful death of a nursing home patient.id.in a decision concerning all three cases,the west virginia supreme court of appeals had held that congress did not intend for the faa to be,in any way,applicable to those particular types of lawsuits,as they only collaterally derive from a contract and involve a service that is a practical necessity for members of the public.brown ex rel.brown genesis healthcare,vacated sub nom.marmet,d.the united states supreme court held the west virginia court interpretation of the faa to be both incorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in its precedent.marmet.at.it stated as this court reaffirmed last term,w hen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim,the analysis is straightforward the conflicting rule is displaced by the faa.that rule resolves these cases.id.alteration in marmet quoting concepcion.at.
that rule also resolves this case.by exempting from arbitration claims for public injunctive relief under the clra,ucl,and fal,the broughton cruz rule similarly prohibits outright arbitration of a particular type of claim.
we reject the argument that because an injunction is technically a remedy rather than a cause of action,the broughton cruz rule is insulated from the faa.we do not think the supreme court intended such a technical reading of the word claim.as we have recognized en banc,recent supreme court decisions have given broad effect to arbitration agreements.kilgore,at.just a few months ago,the supreme court reiterated that courts must rigorously enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms.am.express italian colors,d quoting dean witter reynolds byrd,d.
indeed,this argument appears to be foreclosed by mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d.in mastrobuono,at,the supreme court found that a contract including an arbitration agreement and indicating that it was governed by the laws of the state of new york did not incorporate new york rule prohibiting punitive damages awards in arbitration.the new york rule was premised upon the new york court of appeals conclusion that punitive damages is a social exemplary remedy to address public penal wrongs that evoked strong public policy concerns precluding its application in a purely private setting.garrity lyle stuart.in rejecting the argument that the arbitration agreement incorporated the rule,the supreme court accepted the premise that the rule would be preempted in the absence of an agreement that incorporated it.see mastrobuono,at indicating that the court prior decisions make clear that if contracting parties agree to include claims for punitive damages within the issues to be arbitrated,the faa ensures that their agreement will be enforced according to its terms even if a rule of state law would otherwise exclude such claims from arbitration.the supreme court has since stated that mastrobuono stands for the proposition that the faa state law s requiring judicial resolution of claims involving punitive damages.marmet.at citing mastrobuono,at.moreover,a rule that precludes an arbitrator from fashioning injunctive relief is similar to the supreme court illustrative list of preempted state rules in concepcion.at.these include rules that would prohibit enforcement of arbitration agreements that failed to provide for judicially monitored discovery,fail ed to abide by the federal rules of evidence,or disallow ed an ultimate disposition by a jury.id.this all strongly suggests even where a specific remedy has implications for the public at large,it must be arbitrated under the faa if the parties have agreed to arbitrate it.
moreover,in applying the broughton cruz rule,the district court in this case apparently intended to determine for itself in the first instance whether corinthian was liable under the ucl,fal,and clra,and then,if it found liability,to consider whether an injunction was warranted.under those circumstances,the effect of the broughton cruz rule is to prohibit outright arbitration of three particular types of claims,so long as the plaintiff seeks a public injunction under those causes of action.this violates the faa.
subsequent decisions of the united states supreme court have made clear that the broughton cruz rule is flawed in other ways as well.to begin with,the california supreme court relied on the inherent conflict analysis drawn from mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,d,but,as observed in the italian colors dissent,that analysis does not apply to state statutes such as those that form the basis of plaintiffs request for a public injunction in this case.the effective vindication exception,which permits the invalidation of an arbitration agreement when arbitration would prevent the effective vindication of a federal statute,does not extend to state statutes.see italian colors.at kagan,j,dissenting.
the effective vindication and inherent conflict exceptions are two sides of the same coin the former turning on the ability to vindicate a statute,and the latter turning on the underlying purposes of a statute.both exceptions are reserved for claims brought under federal statutes.they rest on the principle that other federal statutes stand on equal footing with the faa.in both mitsubishi motors and italian colors the claims at issue were under the federal antitrust laws,and the argument was that the federal antitrust statutes modified the faa.in the context,one law does not automatically bow to
