the suit underlying this appeal complains of unsolicited faxes sent in violation of the federal telephone consumer protection act,tcpa,which grants those who receive illegal faxes a private cause of action in state court if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state.b.texas did not expressly permit a private right of action for unsolicited faxes until september,when the legislature amended the business and commerce code to allow parties to bring suit in state court for tcpa violations.act of may,ch.laws current version at.bus.com.code f.we must decide whether the faxes at issue in this case,which were sent before september,are actionable in texas state courts under the tcpa.we conclude that they are not,and reverse and render judgment against the recipients.
background 
beginning in,the chair king,and others collectively plaintiffs or recipients complain that they began to receive illegal faxes from various companies advertising their products.they originally filed suit in federal court,but the court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction chair king,houston cellular,cir.the plaintiffs then filed this suit in state court against a number of defendants alleging a private damage claim under the tcpa,negligence,negligence per se,invasion of privacy,trespass to chattels,gross negligence,and conspiracy among the senders.the trial court granted the defendants joint and individual motions and denied the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment.the plaintiffs settled with various defendants during the course of the proceedings,leaving only gte mobilnet of houston,gte mobilnet and,as defendants before the court of appeals.
the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment in part,and reversed and remanded in part.specifically,the court affirmed the trial court summary judgment on all of the claims,on all claims against after applying texas statute of limitations,and on certain plaintiffs tcpa claims against gte mobilnet that the court considered barred by limitations.id.at.the court reversed the trial court judgment as to the remaining plaintiffs tcpa claims against gte mobilnet which were remanded for further proceedings.id.
both sides petitioned this court for review,the plaintiffs challenging the court of appeals determination of the limitations issue and the defendants contending,inter alia,that there was no tcpa private right of action cognizable in texas courts until the legislature enacted enabling legislation in.alternatively,defendants claim they can not be liable for faxes transmitted by independent advertising companies acting at the behest of independent retailers.we granted the parties petitions for review to consider the tcpa application and related issues.
ii.the telephone consumer protection act 
congress enacted the telephone consumer protection act in by amending the communications act of,stat,codified as amended at.the tcpa purposes were to protect the privacy interests of residential telephone subscribers by placing restrictions on unsolicited,automated telephone calls and to facilitate interstate commerce by restricting certain uses of facsimile fax machines and automatic dialers,at,reprinted in.the legislation was intended to address a growing number of consumer complaints related to the use of automated telephone equipment to make unsolicited telephone calls and faxes.that growth was spurred by a dramatic decrease in the cost of service,which in turn reduced the expenses associated with telemarketing.id.at,reprinted in.
before the tcpa enactment,many states had promulgated regulations aimed at limiting unsolicited intrastate telemarketing,but constitutional constraints prevented them from reaching interstate communications.id.at,reprinted in,noting states do not have jurisdiction over interstate calls.many states have expressed a desire for federal legislation to regulate interstate telemarketing calls to supplement their restrictions on intrastate calls.by the time the tcpa became law,over forty states had legislatively limited the use of players or otherwise restricted telemarketing,reprinted in.but given that state regulation reached only intrastate communications,consumer complaints to the federal communications commission fcc soared,reprinted in.the tcpa quickly followed.
statutory framework 
the tcpa presents what has been described as an unusual constellation of statutory features.chair king,at.on one hand,the act creates a federal private right of action,but on the other it confers exclusive jurisdiction on state courts to entertain it.id.the tcpa does contain an exclusive federal enforcement component,authorizing state attorneys general to bring civil actions in federal court on behalf of their state residents to obtain injunctive relief against unauthorized telephone calls and facsimiles and to recover monetary damages.f.for such actions the tcpa authorizes the fcc to intervene as of right,to be heard in all such matters,and to file petitions for appeal.f.but for purposes of private enforcement and redress,jurisdiction is exclusive.
under the tcpa,it is illegal to use any telephone facsimile machine,computer or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.b c.section b creates a private right of action for recipients of unsolicited faxes to obtain monetary and injunctive relief,as follows 
private right of action.a person or entity may,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,bring in an appropriate court of that state 
a an action based on a violation of this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,
b an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation,or to receive in damages for each such violation,whichever is greater,or 
c both such actions.
id.b emphasis added.it is the import of the statutory proviso if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state that the parties dispute and that courts have struggled to interpret.
the defendants claim the right of action that the tcpa affords is not that is,the private cause of action the act creates is not immediately enforceable in texas courts without state enabling legislation.for the plaintiffs to bring such a claim,defendants contend,texas laws or rules of court must otherwise permit it,and texas did not until september,when the legislature amended the texas business and commerce code to permit private tcpa claims act of may,ch.laws,codified as amended at.com.code f.defendants argument mirrors what has sometimes been referred to as the approach to the tcpa,in effect requiring some type of affirmative state before the private right of action is cognizable in state court.
the plaintiffs take a contrary view.because the tcpa is federal law,they claim,state courts of general jurisdiction are inherently empowered,and indeed required,to enforce it.see tafflin levitt,d.according to plaintiffs,the tcpa created an immediately actionable private right of action in state court and there was no need for state enabling legislation.to support their position,plaintiffs posit two interpretations of the tcpa commonly known as acknowledgment and.
for reasons that we will explain,we believe the tcpa plain language,purpose,and historical context favor the interpretation.we begin by examining all three interpretive approaches and the reasoning behind them.
interpreting the statutory proviso 
the acknowledgment approach 
the acknowledgment position that some courts have adopted interprets the supremacy clause of the united states constitution to require states to provide a forum for private tcpa damage claims with no ability to decline.see ponte architects,investors alert,consumer crusade,affordable health care solutions,colo,const.art.vi,cl.this constitution,and the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby.the focal point of the acknowledgment approach is the general rule that a state may not decline to enforce a federal cause of action 
t he constitution and laws passed pursuant to it are as much laws in the state as laws passed by the state legislature.the supremacy clause makes those laws the supreme law of the land,and charges state courts with a coordinate responsibility to enforce that law according to their regular modes of procedure.
howlett rose,d.according to this view,no state enabling legislation is necessary for parties to assert private tcpa causes of action,and states may not decline to entertain them.the presumption of jurisdiction over federal causes of action can be rebutted only by an explicit statutory directive,by unmistakable implication from legislative history,or by a clear incompatibility between jurisdiction and federal interests,gulf offshore mobil oil,d,and courts espousing the acknowledgment view have found nothing in the tcpa language or legislative history to rebut the presumption.see,consumer crusade,at.
it is,of course,generally true that states may not decline to recognize or enforce federal law.howlett,at.but the federal law that states are required to enforce must be applied according to its terms.had the tcpa simply provided that a person or entity may bring an action based on a tcpa violation,the states constitutional obligation under the supremacy clause to entertain such claims would be irrefutable.but congress chose to qualify the private tcpa right of action it created by including the proviso if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state.b.failure to give effect to the statutory proviso would itself run the risk of violating the supremacy clause by refusing to apply the federal right as written.
under the acknowledgment interpretation,the tcpa if otherwise permitted language merely acknowledges states rights to structure their court systems and apply neutral procedures to federal causes of action.see,consumer crusade,at stating no state can refuse to entertain a private tcpa action,but a state is not compelled to adopt special procedural rules for such actions.courts adopting this interpretation have relied heavily on a speech by the tcpa author,senator ernest hollings of south carolina,when he introduced the substitute bill containing the private right of action eventually codified at b 
the substitute bill contains a private provision that will make it easier for consumers to recover damages from receiving these computerized calls.the provision would allow consumers to bring an action in state court against any entity that violates the bill.the bill does not,because of constitutional constraints,dictate to the states which court in each state shall be the proper venue for such an action,as this is a matter for state legislators to determine.nevertheless,it is my hope that states will make it as easy as possible for consumers to bring such actions,preferably in small claims court.the consumer outrage at receiving these calls is clear.unless congress makes it easier for consumers to obtain damages from those who violate this bill,these abuses will undoubtedly continue.
small claims court or a similar court would allow the consumer to appear before the court without an attorney.the amount of damages in this legislation is set to be fair to both the consumer and the telemarketer.however,it would defeat the purposes of the bill if the attorneys costs to consumers of bringing an action were greater than the potential damages.i thus expect that the states will act reasonably in permitting their citizens to go to court to enforce this bill.
cong.rec.statement of hollings.senator hollings speech on the day the substitute bill was introduced is the only available legislative history concerning the provision.
we do not find the argument that senator hollings speech compels an acknowledgment interpretation persuasive.while the statement may have accurately reflected senator hollings understanding of the private right of action,there can be no certainty that it reflected the view of the entire congress.see chem.de la lastra,t he intent of an individual legislator,even a statute principal author,is not legislative history controlling the construction to be given a statute.and even if we were to presume that senator hollings speech accurately captured congressional intent,it can just as fairly be read to support an approach.by stating his expectation that the states will act reasonably in permitting their citizens to go to court to enforce this bill,senator hollings implies that states must act in an affirmative manner before the tcpa private damage claim is cognizable in state court.in sum,we believe that senator hollings remarks are of limited interpretive value.
the acknowledgment approach to interpreting the tcpa if otherwise permitted proviso presents a number of problems.for one,it renders certain language in the tcpa doubly redundant.chair king,at.state district courts of general jurisdiction are presumed to have adjudicative power over federal statutory private damage claims unless congress specifically decides otherwise,so there would be no reason for congress to import that general principle into the statutory proviso when it does not do so in other federal statutes.see id.nevertheless,congress did choose to acknowledge this general principle elsewhere in the tcpa by stating that suit may be brought in an appropriate court of that state.b.interpreting the if otherwise permitted provision to have the same meaning would be redundant and risk rendering the words meaningless.chair king,at.
the strongest argument supporting the acknowledgment approach emphasizes the statutory proviso reference to court rules if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state b emphasis added.rules of court generally refer to the procedures courts implement to conduct official business.see,black law dictionary ed defining court rules as r egulations having the force of law governing practice and procedure in the various courts.plaintiffs assert that by referencing rules of court,which generally do not confer jurisdiction over causes of action,congress chose to acknowledge states rights to independently administer their own courts and,by negative implication,signaled no intent to require affirmative legislative action at the state level before a party could exercise the private right of action.any other interpretation,plaintiffs claim,would render the rules of court language mere surplusage.see spradlin jim walter homes.however,applying an acknowledgment interpretation to the statutory proviso is no less problematic.as we have said,the same rule against surplusage is equally applicable to the acknowledgment interpretation.see chair king,at stating it would be redundant and risk rendering the words meaningless to interpret the if otherwise permitted clause to have the same meaning as the clause allowing suit in an appropriate court of that state.moreover,if the statutory reference to rules of court was intended to imply no state option over allowing the federally created claim,the if otherwise permitted by the laws of a state language would be rendered surplusage.b emphasis added see spradlin,at.
in sum,we see no clear indication in either the statutory language or the legislative history that would indicate congress intended to unconditionally mandate a private tcpa damage claim in state court that the states could not choose to decline.like the court of appeals,we reject the acknowledgment interpretation of the tcpa that some courts have followed.
having determined that the statutory proviso was intended to give the tcpa some conditional effect,we must decide whether congress intended for the act to apply unless a state opted out,or only if a state opted in.
the approach 
the interpretation reads the tcpa to immediately authorize private rights of action in state court without the necessity of affirmative state action,but allows states to legislatively decline to entertain them.to date,this appears to be the majority view of the relatively few courts that have had occasion to decide the issue.see mulhern macleod,lary flasch bus.consulting,so d condon office depot,so d kaufman acs,th,d reynolds diamond foods poultry,zelma market,aronson.hooters of augusta,nicholson,schulman chase manhattan bank.of the courts that follow the po
