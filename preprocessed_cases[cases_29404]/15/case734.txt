background 
in october and november of,the cities of santa monica and san francisco enacted virtually identical ordinances prohibiting financial institutions from charging atm fees to.the ordinances define financial institutions as any bank,savings association,savings bank,credit union,or industrial loan company,and target california two largest banks,bank of america and wells fargo bank.
these ordinances are enforced through private rights of action.under the ordinances,any consumer who pays an unlawful atm fee may sue for actual damages of not less than plus attorney fees and costs.in addition,punitive damages of up to are allowed where the financial institution has engaged in a pattern of willful violations.the ordinances also permit consumers and municipal officials to seek injunctive relief.
the banks dispute the validity of the ordinances and began litigating almost immediately after the cities enacted the ordinances.the following is a summary of the parties allegations and the procedural history.
the cities allegations.
the cities allege that atm fees charged to harm consumers.they point out that are charged twice for using an atm they insist that atm fees unduly burden the elderly,the disabled,and the poor because of their lower mobility and their relative lack of choice over which atms to use.
the cities also allege that atm fees undermine competition in the local banking industry.the cities argue that smaller banks and credit unions lose market share to larger banks because depositors seeking to avoid atm fees transfer their accounts to banks that operate more atms in the cities.
the banks allegations.
the banks reject the cities characterization of the atm market.they claim that atms are net cost centers for banks who on average lose between and annually per atm.the banks also dispute the cities contention that atm fees have led to greater concentration in the local banking industry.
additionally,the banks argue that their ability to compete is impaired by the ordinances.the ordinances definition of financial institution does not include all atm operators.for instance,credit card companies are exempt from compliance because the ordinances limited definition of financial institution does not include them.this disparate treatment of atm operators under the ordinances would put the banks at a competitive disadvantage.
procedural history.
upon passage of the ordinances,the banks,not surprisingly,suspended atm service to.on november,the banks filed a complaint against the cities seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinances are by the national bank act.on november,the district court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the ordinances pending resolution of this action.the ninth circuit affirmed,holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that preliminary injunctive relief was appropriate under the circumstances.bank of am.city and county of san francisco,cir.
on january,the district court granted california federal bank cal fed motion to intervene as a plaintiff in this action.the following day,cal fed filed its complaint against the cities seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinances are preempted by the home owners loan act as applied to federal savings banks.subsequently,the parties filed for summary judgment.
on june,the district court denied the cities for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of cal fed and the banks.the district court rejected the cities claim that the savings clause in the efta permits the cities to regulate atm fees as a consumer protection measure.it held that the efta provision is specifically limited to the efta and does not grant additional authority to the cities to regulate national banks.
the district court found that the hola and the office of thrift supervision ots regulations occupy the entire field of atm fees with respect to federal savings banks.it also found that the hola and ots regulations authorize federal savings banks to charge atm fees.thus,the district court held that hola preempt the ordinances.the district court also held that the national bank act and the regulations of the office of comptroller of currency occ,which permit nationally chartered banks to charge atm fees,the ordinances.
because of these findings,the district court permanently enjoined the cities from enforcing the ordinances.the cities appeal.

discussion 
preemption.
we find that the ordinances are preempted by federal law and regulations and thus invalid by reason of the supremacy clause of the constitution in determining whether a municipal ordinance is preempted by federal law,our sole task is to ascertain the intent of congress.cal.fed.sav.loan ass guerra,d.federal law may state law in three different ways.first,congress may preempt state law by so stating in express terms.jones rath packing,d.second,preemption may be inferred when federal regulation in a particular field is so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.rice santa fe elevator.in such cases of field preemption,the mere volume and complexity of federal regulations demonstrate an implicit congressional intent to displace all state law.geier am.honda motor,d internal quotations and citation omitted.third,preemption may be implied when state law actually conflicts with federal law.fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d.such a conflict arises when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,florida lime avocado growers,paul,d,or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,hines davidowitz.
the cities contend that all preemption analysis begins with the presumption against preemption.this rests on the assumption that congress did not intend to supplant state law.however,the presumption is not triggered when the state regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence.united states locke,d.
congress has legislated in the field of banking from the days of maryland,wheat,creating an extensive federal statutory and regulatory scheme.the history of national banking legislation has been one of interpreting grants of both enumerated and incidental powers to national banks as grants of authority not normally limited by,but rather ordinarily,contrary state law.barnett bank nelson,d citations omitted.indeed,since the passage of the national bank act in,the federal presence in banking has been significant.see id.at.similarly,since the passage of the hola in,ots regulations have governed the powers and operations of every federal savings and loan association from its cradle to its corporate grave.de la cuesta,at,quoting people coast fed.sav.loan ass n.this court has recognized that regulation of federal savings associations by the ots has been so pervasive as to leave no room for state regulatory control.conference of fed.sav.loan ass ns stein,cir,aff,d.
state regulation of banking is permissible when it does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank exercise of its powers.barnett bank,at.thus,states retain some power to regulate national banks in areas such as contracts,debt collection,acquisition and transfer of property,and taxation,zoning,criminal,and tort law nevertheless,because there has been a history of significant federal presence in national banking,the presumption against preemption of state law is inapplicable.locke,at.see barnett bank,at.franklin nat.bank new york.
ii.the home owners loan act preempts the ordinances.
historical context.
the home owners loan act of was enacted to restore the public confidence in savings and loan associations at a time when of home loans were in default.see stein,at see also.congress enacted the hola as a result of its dissatisfaction with state regulation of home financing.stein,at.the ots,an office of the department of the treasury,was thus created and vested with plenary authority to administer the hola 
b.the hola and ots regulations authorize atm fees.
the hola empowers the ots,under such rules and regulations as it may provide for the organization,incorporation,examination,operation,and regulation of federal savings associations,giving primary consideration of the best practices of thrift institutions in the united states.a.the hola authorizes the ots to promulgate regulations appropriate to carry out its responsibilities.a.pursuant to this authorization,the ots regulates,inter alia,the enforcement of laws,regulations,or conditions against such associations.b.
the hola also permits federal savings associations to establish remote service units for the purpose of crediting savings or demand accounts,debiting such accounts,crediting payments on loans,and disposing of related financial transactions as provided in regulations prescribed by the ots.b f.the ots authorizes federal savings associations to use electronic means or facilities to perform any function,or provide any product or service,as part of an authorized activity.a.electronic means or facilities include atms.id.the ots also permits federal savings associations to transfer,with or without fee,their customers funds from any account of the customer at the federal savings association or at another financial intermediary to third parties or other accounts of the customer on the customer order or authorization by any mechanism or device.
a federal savings association authority to conduct electronic fund transfers is not limited to its own depositors.rather,it applies to any customer.compare id.with b authorizing the marketing and sale of electronic capacities and to.the ots further permits federal savings associations to charge fees for deposit and services.see authorizing transfer of funds with or without fee f authorizing service charges and fees for activities b authorizing fees,including servicing fees.it follows that a federal savings association may charge for atm services.
hola and ots regulations preempt the ordinances atm fee prohibition.
having determined that the hola and ots regulations permit federal associations to charge atm fees to,we also find that hola and ots preempt the ordinances.
field preemption is implied when the scheme of federal regulation in a particular field is so pervasive as to leave no room for the states to supplement it.rice,at.federal regulations have no less effect than federal statutes.de la cuesta,at.
indeed,the regulation of federal savings associations by the ots is so pervasive as to leave no room for state regulatory control.stein,at.the ordinances purport to regulate the operations,and the deposit and practices of federal savings banks.however,ots regulations occupy these fields.see asserting field preemption of operations of federal associations b asserting field preemption of practices of federal associations a asserting field preemption of practices of federal associations.
ots regulation governs the operations of federal savings banks and expressly preempts contrary state law.section provides that the ots has plenary and exclusive authority to regulate all aspects of the operations of federal savings associations.it also provides that the exercise of this authority is preemptive of any state law purporting to address the subject of the operations of a federal savings association.id.
the cities illogically contend that the charging of atm fees is not part of the operations of a federal savings association.however,operations include funds transfer services,which federal savings associations are authorized to provide with or without fee.moreover,federal associations are authorized to use electronic means or facilities to perform any function,or provide any product or service.a.
therefore,we hold that the hola and ots regulations together preempt conflicting state limitations on the authority of federal savings associations to collect fees for provision of deposit and electronic services and that prohibition of atm fees by the ordinances is therefore invalid under the supremacy clause of the constitution.because the ordinances are preempted for attempting to regulate the operations of federal savings banks,we do not discuss the alternate justifications for preemption including field preemption of deposit and activities as well as conflict.
iii.the national bank act preempts the ordinances.
we also find that national bank act preempts the ordinances.
historical context.
national banks are instrumentalit ies of the federal government,created for a public purpose,and subject to the paramount authority of the united states.marquette bank first of omaha serv,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.state attempts to control the conduct of national banks are void if they conflict with federal law,frustrate the purposes of the national bank act,or impair the efficiency of national banks to discharge their duties.first nat.bank california.the supremacy of the federal government in regulating national banks has long been recognized 
the national bank act of was enacted to protect national banks against intrusive regulation by the states.see cong.globe,noting that the object of the national bank act was to establish a national banking system free from intrusive state regulation marquette bank,at.close examination of the national bank act of,its legislative history,and its historical context makes clear that congress intended to facilitate a national banking system.internal quotations and citations omitted.to fulfill this congressional purpose,the supreme court has interpret ed grants of both enumerated and incidental powers to national banks as grants of authority not normally limited by,but rather ordinarily preempting,contrary state law.barnett bank,at.citations omitted.therefore,in determining the preemptive scope of federal statutes and regulations granting a power to national banks,the supreme court has adopted the view that normally congress would not want states to forbid,or to impair significantly,the exercise of a power that congress explicitly granted.id.at.
incidental powers of national banks under seventh.
the national bank act of,seventh,confers upon national banks the authority 
to exercise all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking by discounting and negotiating promissory notes,drafts,bills of exchange,and other evidences of debt by receiving deposits by buying and selling exchange,coin,and bullion by loaning money on personal security and by obtaining,issuing,and circulating notes 
the business of banking is not limited to the powers enumerated in seventh.nationsbank variable annuity life ins,d.therefore,the occ may authorize additional activities if encompassed by a reasonable interpretation of seventh.indep.ins.agents of,hawke.
incidental powers include activities that are convenient or useful in connection with the performance of one of the bank established activities pursuant to its express powers under the national bank act.m m leas
