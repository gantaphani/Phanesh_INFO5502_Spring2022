alan wayne appeals from the judgment entered after an order granting summary judgment in favor of staples,in this putative class action filed by wayne alleging that,in selling declared value coverage for packages shipped at its retail stores,staples violated the consumers legal remedies act,civil code section et,by charging an unconscionable price business and professions code section et by utilizing a deceptive parcel shipping order form and business and professions code section by selling inland marine insurance without a license.although we affirm the trial court orders with respect to wayne causes of action alleging unconscionable pricing and deceptive marketing,we reverse its ruling that staples offer of declared value coverage as part of package shipping transactions is not subject to regulation under the insurance code and remand the matter for further proceedings as to the first cause of action for unfair business practices.
factual and procedural background 
staples package shipping business and the sale of declared value coverage 
the fundamental facts underlying wayne complaint are essentially undisputed.staples,a nationwide retailer of office supplies and services,offers package shipping services to its customers through its agreement to serve as an authorized shipping outlet for united parcel service ups.staples expressly disclaims any liability for loss or damage to parcels shipped through its stores.the face page of its parcel shipping order form states,we assume no liability for the delivery of the parcels accepted for shipment nor for loss or damage by any cause to the parcels or their contents while in transit.in the event of loss or damage to any parcels,we will assist you in filing and processing of claims only.
staples shipping customers may protect themselves from the risk of loss or damage to their packages by purchasing insurance through staples calls declared value coverage and what is elsewhere identified as excess value coverage or excess value insurance.ups charges staples per of declared value over for this coverage however,prior to may staples charged its customers per of declared value over for the coverage customers are advised of the total cost for the coverage either orally by a staples sales associate or in writing through a printed receipt given to customers before they pay for the shipping or the coverage.although staples notified its customers it may place a surcharge on the coverage,it did not inform them its standard charge for the coverage included a percent markup or margin.
the back page of staples parcel shipping order form refers customers to the ups service guide for a description of the terms and conditions of the insurance coverage you may purchase declared value coverage through the carrier designated on this pso parcel shipping order or from an independent company,if available.the declared value terms and conditions for the various carriers can be found in the carriers service guide.the declared value terms and conditions for the various carriers and any applicable independent company selected by you are available for review at this staples center.upon request,you may receive a photocopy of such terms and conditions.please note that we may surcharge the cost of this product as an administrative expense,for services such as processing of potential claims and other related services.
ups excess value coverage or excess value insurance is provided through an inland marine basic policy from the national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,national union.customers who purchase the coverage at staples or at other ups shipping sites are additional insureds under the policy.in general,offering insurance coverage is an activity requiring a license and regulated by the insurance code.see,unless exempt by the provisions of this article,a person shall not solicit,negotiate,or effect contracts of insurance unless the person holds a valid license from the commissioner authorizing the person to act in that capacity.requiring approval of insurance rates and prohibiting excessive or inadequate rates.
wayne class action complaint staples answer and affirmative defenses 
wayne,a staples customer who shipped a package from a staples store after he had purchased declared value coverage,filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of all california residents who had purchased declared value coverage from staples alleging staples and its employees solicit and execute contracts for marine inland insurance offered by ups and keep percent of the premium collected as commission.in his first cause of action wayne alleged staples engages in unfair business practices because it is not licensed to sell insurance,charges an excessive insurance premium and does not comply with procedures and regulations established by the insurance commissioner for the sale of insurance.in his second cause of action wayne alleged staples retail price for declared value coverage,then twice the regular premium charged by ups,is excessive and unconscionable in violation of the consumer legal remedies act.his third cause of action alleged staples parcel shipping order form is deceptive because it fails to properly disclose staples percent profit or markup on the sale of declared value coverage.the complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages as well as equitable relief.
in its answer,in addition to denying the material allegations of wayne unverified complaint,staples asserted as an affirmative defense that the contracts between staples and its shipping customers are not contracts of insurance or subject to regulation as insurance contracts because the principal object or purpose of each agreement is to ship packages,not to shift or assume liability as would be the case with a contract of insurance.staples also asserted as a further affirmative defense that all damages sought by wayne on behalf of the putative class were avoidable because each staples customer had the option not to purchase declared value coverage after being advised of the charge as well as to ship their packages,with or without declared value coverage,through a competing shipping service.
the motion for resolution of key jury instructions and motion in limine 
to permit early determination of legal issues central to the case and with the permission of the court,staples filed a motion for resolution of key jury instructions and motion in limine,which addressed whether the jury should be instructed on the insurance code with respect to wayne first cause of action,whether staples charge for declared value coverage is unconscionable and whether its parcel shipping order form is deceptive.after discovery,briefing and argument the court ruled in favor of staples on each question,concluding wayne transactions with staples were not governed by the insurance code because the principal object and purpose of the transactions at issue was shipping a package,not shifting the risk of loss staples charge for declared value coverage was not unconscionable as a matter of law and staples parcel shipping order form was not misleading to its customers.
staples motion for summary judgment 
following these rulings staples filed a motion for summary judgment or in the alternative summary adjudication as to each of the three causes of action asserted by wayne,reiterating the factual and legal arguments presented in connection with its motion for resolution of key jury instructions and motion in limine.after receipt of opposition and reply papers and oral argument,the trial court granted this motion as well.
as to wayne first cause of action alleging unfair business practices,the court held,staples is not violating the insurance code by offering declared value coverage as part of its package shipping transactions,whether or not declared value coverage constitutes insurance.the undisputed facts indicate that the principal object and purpose of these transactions is the shipment of a package.as to the second cause of action for violation of the consumers legal remedies act,the court held,the undisputed facts indicate that staples markup on declared value coverage is not unconscionable as a matter of law.as to the third cause of action for untrue and misleading advertising,the court ruled,the undisputed facts indicate that staples parcel shipping order form is not deceptive.staples charge for declared value coverage is clearly disclosed at the time of purchase.the full price of declared value coverage is disclosed to the customer before he or she pays for it.the customer can decline to accept the coverage,or decline to ship the package with staples.staples customers are always notified of the charge before they choose to buy the declared value coverage.furthermore,in connection with the hearing in this case in may,plaintiff argued that the use of the word may by staples was deceptive because,at that point,staples always did surcharge the cost of ups declared value coverage.staples pointed out that its pricing policy could change.in fact,shortly after that hearing,staples pricing policy did change.staples does not currently surcharge any of ups shipping charges.the use of the word may was and is full,proper disclosure.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo and decide independently whether the facts not subject to triable dispute warrant judgment for the moving party as a matter of law.intel hamidi cal th,d,code civ,subd.c.
the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to wayne unfair business practices cause of action on the ground staples offer of declared value coverage is not subject to regulation under the insurance code 
negotiating the sale of insurance,even if not the principal object of a commercial transaction,is subject to regulation under the insurance code 
the trial court ruled staples was not violating the insurance code by offering shipping customers declared value coverage,a form of inland marine insurance because the offer and sale of that coverage is only incidental to the principal object of the transaction the shipment of the customer package.the test is an essential analytic tool to evaluate whether certain contracts that contain risk allocation provisions qualify as insurance.see,automotive funding group,garamendi th,d afg truta avis rent a car system,d.truta.nonetheless,the trial court erred in applying this test to staples package shipping services to conclude staples offer and sale of inland marine insurance was not subject to regulation by the insurance code or the department of insurance 
insurance code section defines insurance as a contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss,damage,or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event.section has been interpreted as requiring two elements shifting one party risk of loss to another party and distributing that risk among similarly situated persons.afg,supra,th at,d truta,supra,d at.the mere fact a contract involves shifting and distributing risk of loss,however,does not necessarily mean the agreement constitutes an insurance contract for purposes of statutory regulation.title ins.state bd.of equalization cal th,d,sweatman department of veterans affairs cal th,d.thus,the court of appeal in truta held the collision damage waivers offered by car rental companies were not insurance because t he principal object and purpose of the transaction before us,the elements which gives the transaction its distinctive character,is the rental of an automobile.peripheral to that primary object is an option,available to the lessee,for additional consideration,to reallocate the risk of loss up to the sum of to the lessor in the event the vehicle sustains damage during the rental term.thus,after reviewing the entire contract we are satisfied that this tangential risk allocation provision should not have the effect of converting the defendants as contacting lessors into insurers subject to statutory regulation.truta,at.accord,afg,at,d debt cancellation program offered by lender is not insurance primary objective of transactions is to finance used car purchases.
the test in truta,supra,d,and afg,supra,th,d,is whether the principal purpose of the transaction is risk allocation and indemnification or something else.an incidental contract provision that,for a fee,shifts risk of loss from the consumer to the provider of the goods or services does not make the agreement an insurance contract subject to regulation under the insurance code.see,truta,at.the collision damage waiver transaction is not a spreading of risk within insurance concepts,but is rather an allocation of risk by contractual agreement.
neither truta,supra,d,nor afg,supra,th,d,holds,however,that the sale of insurance coverage as an incidental part of a more extensive transaction is not subject to regulation under the insurance code.see,grand rent a car century ins.th,d car rental agreement that contains provision indemnifying renter from liability to third persons resulting from accidents occurring while the rented car is in use constitutes insurance even when the liability rental agreement is effectuated by a certificate of hertz home ins.th,fn,d same,distinguishing truta.in other words,while it is true not all contracts allocating risk are insurance contracts subject to statutory regulation,all insurance contracts,even if sold as a secondary or incidental facet of a transaction with another,primary commercial purpose,are regulated by the insurance code and the department of insurance unless they fall within a specific regulatory exemption.followed to its logical extreme,the contrary rule,as adopted by the trial court in this case,would permit a car dealership to obtain commissions for the sale of automobile insurance or a real estate broker to sell homeowners insurance without being subject to regulation by the insurance code or the insurance commissioner because in each instance the sale of insurance was incidental to the purchase of a car or a house.
use of the test to exempt a contract of inland marine insurance from statutory regulation is particularly inappropriate because this class of coverage,expressly regulated by the insurance code see,subd,is intended to protect against loss or damage to goods in transit or while being prepared for or awaiting shipment.as a result,this insurance coverage will most often be offered,as it was in this case,in connection with,and incidental to,the customer primary purpose of shipping his or her goods.indeed,this distinctive aspect of inland marine insurance has been recognized in section of the insurance code,which exempts shippers such as ups and staples from insurance licensing requirements if they complete or deliver a certificate of coverage under an inland marine insurance contract to their customers without being paid or receiving a commission no license is required under the provisions of this chapter for a person to act in the following capacities or to engage in the following activities,providing no commission is paid or allowed,directly or indirectly,by the insurer,creditor,retailer,or other person for acting in those capacities or engaging in those activities h the completion or delivery of a declaration or certificate of coverage under a running inland marine insurance contract evidencing coverage thereunder and including only those negotiations as are necessary to the completion or delivery if the person performing those acts or his or her employer has an insurable interest in the risk covered by the certificate or declaration,subd.h.
staples profit on the sale of declared value coverage constitutes a commission within the meaning of the insurance code 
the determinative question as to the viability of wayne first cause of action,therefore,is not whether a staples customer principal purpose is shipping his or her package,rather than obtaining insurance against loss or damage to that package during transit,but whether staples percent markup on the cost of the insurance provided through ups constitutes a commission,as wayne argues,or is simply profit,as staples asserts,that does not preclude staples from enjoying the exemption from insurance licensing requirements contained in insurance code section,subdivision h.
labor code section,which specifically addresses the time for payment of commission wages to employees of car dealerships,defines the term commission wages as compensation paid to any person for services rendered in the sale of such employer property or services and based proportionately upon the amount or value thereof.interpreting that provision in keyes motors,division of labor standards enforcement d,this court identified two essential requirements for a compensation scheme to be deemed commission wages the employee must be involved principally in selling a product or service,rather than making or providing the product or service and the amount of payment must be a percent of the price of the product or service.although this definition is part of a narrowly focused labor code provision,the supreme court has held the statute definition of commission is more generally applicable and specifically approved the test we articulated in keyes motors.ramirez yosemite water cal th,d.
with respect to the ups declared or excess value insurance provided to shipping customers at staples retail stores,there can be no serious dispute staples is involved principally in selling the product and it calculated its margin or profit as a percentage of the price of the insurance product charged by ups.staples argues,however,that the same is essentially true for all items it sells in its stores it is in the business of selling goods,and it generates profits by the wholesale price to sell at retail.according to staples,the fact it makes a profit on selling the coverage,as it hopes to do on everything in its stores,does not make that profit a commission.rather,in this context a commission means only a fee paid by ups or national union to staples or a fee paid by staples to its employees each time declared or excess value coverage is sold.
staples argument,although superficially appealing,fails to give sufficient weight to the actual language used in insurance code section to strictly limit the availability of the exemption set forth in subdivision h to instances in which no commission is paid or allowed,directly or indirectly,by the insurer the legislature decision to exclude transactions in which indirect commissions have merely been allowed by the insurer plainly indicates an intent to preclude use of this exemption by anyone who receives from any source a fee,based on the amount of premium paid,for negotiating the sale of insurance.see graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,courts look to the usual and ordinary meaning of the statutory language in order to discern legislative intent murillo fleetwood enterprises,cal th,d,in resolving questions of statutory interpretation,the court must attempt to effectuate the probable intent of the legislature,as expressed through the actual words of the statutes in question the first step is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citations.citation.
moreover,unlike the office products it purchases at wholesale and then resells in its stores,staples does not own the insurance it makes available to its customers.rather,it serves as an agent for their acquisition of the direct or excess value insurance offered by ups,bringing supplier and customer together although,as staples notes,ups does not pay staples for its role in the transaction,at the very least ups allows staples indirectly to impose an additional percentage service fee as part of the gross premium charged to the.as such,the amount collected by staples in excess of the charged by ups for the coverage is commission within the meaning of insurance code section.
in sum,the declared value coverage offered by staples to its shipping customers is,without question,insurance and the fact it is offered only as an incidental aspect of a transaction focused on shipping packages does not exempt staples from insurance licensing requirements.although staples current marketing practices charging its customers only what it is actually charged by ups for excess value insurance may well fall within the exemption provided by insurance code section,subdivision h,the transactions challenged by wayne lawsuit do not qualify for that exemption.accordingly,it was error to grant summary judgment with respect to wayne cause of action asserting staples violations of the insurance code constitute unfair business practices.see stevens superior court th,d private plaintiff may bring action under bus,for violations of licensing provisions of the insurance code.
summary adjudication was properly granted as to wayne cause of action for unconscionable pricing of the declared value coverage

wayne theory of price unconscionability is grounded in a united states tax court opinion dealing with the proper tax reporting consequences of ups sale of declared value coverage.in that opinion,subsequently reversed on appeal,the tax court expressed the view ups charge of per of declared value over was significantly in excess of the actual cost for such insurance on the open market.united parcel s
