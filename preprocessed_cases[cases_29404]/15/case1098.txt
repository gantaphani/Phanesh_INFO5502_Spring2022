defendant registry,udr,is a consumer reporting agency that gathers information about unlawful detainer cases and sells it to landlords and other subscribers.plaintiff faye schoendorf,a tenant,filed this action against udr,alleging that it was providing misleading and incomplete information about her.
udr moved to strike the complaint under section of the code of civil procedure,which prohibits strategic lawsuits against public participation,better known by the acronym slapp.the trial court concluded that this action was a meritless attempt to chill udr constitutional rights and granted the motion.
on appeal udr contends that it was not required to make any changes in plaintiff report because the information she provided was not a matter of public record.we conclude that plaintiff made a sufficient showing that udr should have modified her report even if the additional information was not contained in court files or similar sources.accordingly,we reverse.
background 
udr provides a service to landlords known as tenant screening.udr typically provides its subscribers with consumer reports consisting of a standard credit report from one or more of the three major credit bureaus trans union,experian,and equifax and public record information that is gathered by its own employees from a review of court records regarding evictions,property damage cases,rent cases,foreclosures,and bankruptcies.udr also obtains information directly from its subscribers concerning good tenants and problem tenants,and that information,too,is included in a tenant report.
udr has developed a standard form on which it reports unlawful detainers.the form includes the names of the parties,the date on which the unlawful detainer was filed,the court where it was filed,the case number,the address of the residence involved,the disposition of the case,and a comments section.
udr report on schoendorf,dated may,showed two unlawful detainers.as stated in the report,the first suit was filed on april,and was resolved by dismissal.the comments section was left blank.
the second unlawful detainer,according to the report,was filed on april,and was also dismissed.the comments section read,profane screaming threatening others.
as to both unlawful detainers,the report accurately reflected the information found in the civil register of actions.the report also contained information from the complaint in the second unlawful detainer.the civil register indicated that the court file in the first unlawful detainer had been destroyed in december.the file in the second case was scheduled for destruction in march.
schoendorf retained counsel to deal with udr.by letter dated july,her attorney asked udr to remove both unlawful detainers from the report or,in the alternative,to add clarifying information in the comments section.the letter discussed the suits separately,as follows.
you report a ud filed in april,bearing la municipal court case number.your report indicates that the case was dismissed.your report contains no entries in the comment section.the problem with your report is that it simply does not illustrate the entire situation between schoendorf and her former landlord.
i am enclosing for your review some information concerning a dispute between schoendorf and total real estate management,the plaintiff in the unlawful detainer action.note that the story begins when schoendorf reported a cockroach infestation and other maintenance and health problems in her rented unit to the los angeles department of health services report enclosed.
after the problem was not resolved,schoendorf filed her own affirmative lawsuit against southern pacific land group and total real estate management,among others complaint enclosed.
it was after the filing of this lawsuit that the landlord filed its retaliatory ud.this is the ud that you have reported 
after the issues were joined in the action filed by schoendorf,the parties settled their differences by way of a written settlement agreement.once again,you have failed to mention this.moreover,the settlement was in schoendorf favor and resulted in a payment to her by southwestern and jr k,the landlords document enclosed.
thereafter,the case was dismissed document enclosed.to satisfy inquiring minds,i have even enclosed a copy of the check to schoendorf.
under the circumstances,it appears irresponsible for your agency to report the incident as a ud.however,if reporting the ud is something you think is fair and equitable,then it would also be fair and equitable and certainly appropriate to address the foregoing in your comments section.
demand is therefore made that you either eliminate the ud from your report or,at the least,include a fair and accurate statement of events in your comment section.
you report a ud filed in april,bearing la municipal court case number.the plaintiff in that case was scott properties.
as a preliminary observation,you will note that the ud was not for the of rent,but was apparently filed because schoendorf was accused of profane screaming threatening others.
in order to be fair to all concerned,i am enclosing a letter from the manager of the subject property,wherein she states that the problem was apparently the working of a another tenant who did not get along with schoendorf.as the letter explains,with the exception of this one disgruntled neighbor,there were no other complaints about schoendorf.
in addition,i am sending you a declaration from another tenant who states without exception that schoendorf was a quiet tenant who respected the rights of others.
also included are comments from two other individuals,each of which supports schoendorf reputation as a quiet,polite and proper tenant.
i do know why scott properties decided to prosecute a ud against schoendorf.i do know,however,that schoendorf and scott settled their differences and schoendorf paid all of the agreed rent as a condition of the settlement document enclosed.in fact,schoendorf received a refund of her security deposit document enclosed.
on account of the foregoing,demand is therefore made that you eliminate this ud from your reporting,or,if you chose not to do so,that you report accurately and fairly the true situation in your comment section.
schoendorf attorney subsequently learned that udr did not receive his letter.he sent another letter on september,saying i heard from schoendorf that you have not received a letter which i addressed to your attention on july,i am sending you a copy of the letter of july,with all enclosures.i am sending the letter by certified mail so that there will be no confusion as to the delivery of the correspondence.
on may,udr sent schoendorf a letter,indicating that it had not found any errors in its report.udr also sent some written materials and forms concerning her rights under california law.
schoendorf retained new counsel.on august,he wrote to udr,demanding that the unlawful detainers be removed from schoendorf report.by letter dated august,udr president,harvey saltz,responded,saying we have reviewed the file of faye schoendorf and find it to be correct.for that reason,we can not comply with your request to delete records from her file.we add at this juncture that schoendorf has been informed of her rights as a consumer her records with us and has not taken appropriate steps to ameliorate her file as saltz later stated in a declaration,his august,letter explained that udr had verified that its records accurately reflected the information contained within the court files and would thus not be complying with plaintiff attorney demands.
on february,schoendorf filed this action against udr and saltz collectively udr,alleging causes of action for negligence and cancellation of instrument the instrument being the udr report.schoendorf alleged that the two unlawful detainers were baseless and that udr had improperly reported them,causing damage to her reputation,credit history,and ability to find rental housing.
schoendorf also alleged that the first unlawful detainer was filed to retaliate against her for having contacted the los angeles county department of health services about substandard conditions at her residence.attached to the complaint was a report from the department,dated february,citing the landlord for several health code violations,including infestation with cockroaches living,dead,and egg deposits,lack of a smoke alarm,the need to regrout the sink and faucet in the bathroom,failure to clean the trash room,and the need to rodent proof the trash room door.two months after the department inspection,the landlord filed the unlawful detainer.
on may,udr filed an motion in the present case,seeking to strike the complaint.udr stated that the information in schoendorf report was obtained from court records.in udr words,the report accurately mirrors the information contained in the court own file.udr argued that schoendorf claims arose out of udr exercise of its first amendment right to discuss matters that are related to litigation and to engage in constitutionally protected speech by the truthful reporting of matters contained in the public record.udr also asserted that schoendorf was not likely to prevail on her claims at trial.the motion was supported by a declaration from saltz and several exhibits.
in her opposition to the motion,schoendorf argued that the unlawful detainer suits were retaliatory,that udr knew as much but took no action to correct the information in her report,and that,by providing incomplete and misleading information,udr had violated the california consumer credit reporting agencies act,and the federal fair credit reporting act.the opposition papers were based on declarations from schoendorf and her attorney as well as various exhibits.
by order dated june,the trial court granted udr motion to strike the complaint.schoendorf discharged her attorney and proceeded in propria persona.in subsequent proceedings,the trial court awarded attorneys fees and costs to udr in the amount of.schoendorf filed a notice of appeal.
discussion 
litigation which has come to be known as slapp is defined by the sociologists who coined the term as civil lawsuits that are aimed at preventing citizens from exercising their political rights or punishing those who have done so.
slapp suits are brought to obtain an economic advantage over the defendant,not to vindicate a legally cognizable right of the plaintiff o ne of the common characteristics of a slapp suit is its lack of merit but lack of merit is not of concern to the plaintiff because the plaintiff does not expect to succeed in the lawsuit,only to tie up the defendant resources for a sufficient length of time to accomplish plaintiff underlying objective as long as the defendant is forced to devote its time,energy and financial resources to combating the lawsuit its ability to combat the plaintiff in the political arena is substantially diminished 
because winning is not a slapp plaintiff primary motivation,defendants traditional safeguards against meritless actions,suits for malicious prosecution and abuse of process,requests for sanctions are inadequate to counter slapp.instead,the slapper considers any damage or sanction award which the slappee might eventually recover as merely a cost of doing business by the time a slapp victim can win a suit years later the slapp plaintiff will probably already have accomplished its underlying objective.furthermore,retaliation against the slapper may be because it ties up the slappee resources even longer than defending the slapp suit itself.wilcox superior court th,d,citations italics omitted.
the legislature enacted the statute to protect defendants,including corporate defendants,from interference with the valid exercise of their constitutional rights,particularly the right of freedom of speech and the right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.see lafayette morehouse,chronicle publishing th,fn,d,criticized on another point in damon ocean hills journalism club th,d conroy spitzer th,d.the constitutional rights of a corporation,like those of an individual,can be chilled through an abuse of the judicial process.see pacific gas public util.comm,d.
in bringing an motion,t he moving party bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie showing that the plaintiff cause of action arises from the defendant free speech or petition activity if the defendant establishes a prima facie case,then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,make a prima facie showing of facts which would,if proved at trial,support a judgment in plaintiff favor.in making its determination,the trial court is required to consider the pleadings and the supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.church of scientology wollersheim th,d,citations italics omitted.t he trial court determination of the motion can not involve a weighing of evidence.id.at,d.
it is recognized,with the requirement that the court consider the pleadings and affidavits of the parties,the test is similar to the standard applied to evidentiary showings in summary judgment motions pursuant to code of civil procedure section and requires that the showing be made by competent admissible evidence within the personal knowledge of the declarant averments on information and belief are insufficient as in a motion for summary judgment,the pleadings frame the issues to be decided.church of scientology wollersheim,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
generally,a party can not simply rely on the allegations in its own pleadings,even if verified,to make the evidentiary showing required in the summary judgment context or similar motions the same rule applies to motions under the statute.here,like motions under code of civil procedure section,the pleadings merely frame the issues to be decided.similarly,an averment on information and belief is inadmissible at trial,and thus can not show a probability of prevailing on the claim an assessment of the probability of prevailing on the claim looks to trial,and the evidence that will be presented at that time such evidence must be admissible.church of scientology wollersheim,supra,th at,d,citations,italics omitted.
turning to the language of the statute,a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.code civ,subd.b.
as used in the statute,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.code civ,subd.e see briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,discussing types of statements covered by statute.

in its motion,udr argued that this lawsuit interferes with its first amendment right to disseminate information found in court files.see registry,state of california th,d.in statutory terms,udr asserted that its report on schoendorf was a written statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body code civ,subd.e see,subd.b.as construed by the courts,the statute required udr to establish a prima facie showing that the plaintiff cause of action arises from the defendant free speech or petition activity.church of scientology wollersheim,supra,th at,d,italics added.
