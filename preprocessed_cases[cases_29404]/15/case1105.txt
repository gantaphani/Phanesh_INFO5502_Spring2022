factual and procedural backgrounda.the facts 
oregel leased the car in late march from the ron baker chevrolet isuzu dealership ron baker.it was oregel practice to have all maintenance,including oil changes,performed by ron baker.oregel had ron baker change the car oil every miles.the car was serviced in june and september the invoices for these services do not include a request to check for an oil leak 
in october oregel received a letter from his homeowners association complaining that there was an oil spill on the driveway where he parked the car and asking him to clean the oil from the driveway.he removed the oil,and the following day took the car to ron baker and asked the service department to check for an oil leak.ron baker retightened the egr valve adapter and add ed dye to check for other possible leaks.during the next two weeks,oregel drove the car about miles and then returned it to ron baker.the invoice for that visit reflected that the purpose of the visit was to check for an oil leak ron baker concluded a faulty gasket was the cause and replaced the gasket.
approximately five weeks later,the car was again leaking oil oregel returned to ron baker for an oil change and also asked that the oil leak be fixed.the invoice for that december,visit reflects parts on order,but does not identify what if anything ron baker did to repair the oil leak.however,ron baker told oregel the oil leak had been fixed.
on january,oregel returned to ron baker for another oil change.he also reported that oil was still leaking.the oil was changed and again oregel was told the oil leak was fixed.however,the car continued leaking oil onto oregel driveway and garage floor,and his coworkers noticed and commented on the oil spots where oregel parked the car at his place of employment.on january,oregel returned to ron baker and complained about the continuing oil leak,and also complained that the gas gauge was malfunctioning.ron baker kept the car for two days,and oregel was told the leak had been fixed.the invoice for that visit stated engine failure under the notation concerning the oil leak when oregel returned the car to ron baker around january,to have the gas gauge part installed,he was told ron baker inspected the car and no oil leak was found.
one month later,oregel again returned the car to ron baker and complained the car was continuing to leak oil and asked ron baker to fix the leak.the invoice from that february,visit,reflecting oregel request that ron baker again fix the oil leak,stated that oil from filter gets caught in crossmember but does not identify what ron baker did to attempt to repair the oil leak.however,oregel was told the oil leak was fixed.
the car continued to leak oil despite ron baker efforts to locate and fix the problem oregel began taking photographs documenting the oil stains on his driveway,in his garage and at work he did not return to ron baker or any other isuzu dealer after his visit on february.because he was concerned about the safety and reliability of the car,oregel bought a different vehicle in.thereafter,he did not drive the car and instead kept it in his garage.
oregel initially contacted isuzu in about the problems with the car.he explained the chronic oil leaking problem and asked that the car be replaced.isuzu told oregel that it was awaiting the results of the dye test that would be checked when he returned the car for the gas gauge replacement.however,in a subsequent january conversation,isuzu told oregel that there was a pan under the motor that collected oil and that it would drop some oil for about two weeks after it was cleaned but that it should stop after that period.however,the leaking did not stop.on february,oregel again called isuzu to report the continued leaking,and isuzu advised him to take the car back to a dealer for inspection and repair.oregel then turned the matter over to an attorney.oregel attorney wrote to isuzu revoking acceptance of the car and demanded that isuzu agree to repurchase it.after isuzu informed oregel attorney that the matter had been referred to its regional office for investigation,oregel filed the present lawsuit.
reynolds,an expert employed by isuzu to investigate warranty claims involving isuzu vehicles,examined and tested the car and testified the only oil leakage came from a loose oil pan drain plug bolt he also testified the loose drain plug was attributable to improper maintenance and was therefore not covered under the warranty.however,he could not explain how ron baker mechanics,on the six different occasions they searched for the source of an oil leak,could have missed finding such an obvious source of leakage as a loose drain plug,and conceded it was not likely that mechanics would repeatedly overlook that obvious explanation for oil leakage.
b.the lawsuit 
oregel complaint alleged a claim against isuzu under the act.the liability issues were bifurcated from the damage issue.in the liability phase,the jury found the car oil leak was a nonconformity that substantially impaired the use,value or safety of the car and that isuzu was unable to fix the leak after a reasonable number of attempts.the jury also found isuzu willfully violated its obligation to repurchase the car under the act and should pay a civil penalty to oregel equal to the amount of the damage award.in the damages phase,the court awarded as damages,plus a civil penalty of,plus interest,and entered judgment in accordance with the verdict and damage award
