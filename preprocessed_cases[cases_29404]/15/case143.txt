the law firm solomon and solomon,solomon,and two of its attorneys,julie farina farina and douglas fisher fisher collectively the defendants,appeal from a decision and judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut janet bond arterton,judge granting summary judgment to janet ellis ellis on her claim under the fair debt collection practices act,et.fdcpa or the act.
within five days of a debt collector initial communication with a debtor referred to in the act as a consumer,the debt collector must send the consumer a written validation notice setting forth,among other things,the consumer right to dispute the debt.see a.the consumer has thirty days from receipt of the validation notice to send the debt collector a notification disputing the debt.see a,b.unless the consumer disputes the debt,the debt collector is generally free to continue its collection activities and to communicate with the consumer during the validation period.see b jacobson healthcare fin,cir.collection activities and communications by the debt collector during the validation period must not,however,overshadow or be inconsistent with the disclosures the act requires be provided in the validation notice.see b russell equifax,cir.
after sending a validation notice,and during the validation period,the defendants caused a connecticut state marshal to serve ellis with a summons and complaint.the defendants failed to inform ellis that commencement of the lawsuit had no effect on the information contained in the validation notice.the district court found that the service of the summons and the compliant overshadowed the validation notice in violation of the fdcpa.the defendants argue that under the controlling least sophisticated consumer standard,service of the summons and complaint did not overshadow the disclosures made in the validation notice.we disagree,and for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court.

the above named creditor has referred this account to our office for collection with a notation that all communications cease and desist.under federal law,however,we must provide you with certain disclosures.

ellis acknowledges that she received the letter and that she never disputed the debt.
shortly after the letter was sent,ellis file was given to farina for review.farina decided to take legal action and had another solomon attorney prepare a summons and complaint to be filed on citibank behalf in a collection action against ellis in connecticut superior court.the complaint,which farina signed,claims that ellis failed to make payments on credit extended by citibank and demands in damages in addition to costs and disbursements.both farina and fisher signed the summons,which has a return date of july.under the heading,notice to each defendant,the summons states,in bold and in capital letters you are being sued.the summons also states that t o respond to this summons,or to be informed of further proceedings,you or your attorney must file a form called an appearance with the clerk of the court at the above court address on or before the second day after the return date.defendants who believe that they have insurance coverage for the claim asserted in the complaint are advised to immediately take the summons and complaint to your insurance representative.defendants with questions about the summons are directed to consult an attorney promptly.
ellis was personally served with the summons and complaint by a connecticut state marshal at her home on may,when there were two more weeks to run on the validation period.on june,the summons and complaint were filed in connecticut superior court.the defendants never said anything to ellis regarding the effect of the lawsuit on the information conveyed in the may,letter.
on october,ellis filed suit against the defendants under the fdcpa,and on april,ellis amended the complaint.the amended complaint asserts that the defendants violated numerous provisions of the fdcpa,including,in the course of their efforts to collect the debt allegedly owed by ellis to citibank.as relief,ellis sought damages and equitable relief,in addition to attorneys fees and costs.
ellis moved for partial summary judgment,and defendants for summary judgment on all of the claims in the amended complaint.the district court granted ellis summary judgment on her claim that the defendants violated of the fdcpa by serving her with the summons and complaint during the validation period,holding that,
in a case such as this,where plaintiff is served with a summons and complaint in a collection action against her by a within the validation period but no accompanying communication is given to the consumer assuring her that the validation period and rights remain in force and are not affected by service of the lawsuit,the earlier notice of the consumer rights is overshadowed.having filed suit against ellis without any clarifying communication that her dispute right continued notwithstanding the pendency of the suit,defendants violated the fdcpa 
ellis solomon solomon,d.
since a single violation of the fdcpa is sufficient to impose liability,the district court dismissed ellis remaining claims as moot,denied the defendants motion for summary judgment on the claim,and denied the remainder of the defendants motion as moot.ellis was awarded in statutory damages in addition to costs and attorneys fees.this timely appeal ensued

discussion 
congress enacted the fdcpa to eliminate abusive practices in the debt collection industry,and to ensure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged.jacobson,at quoting e.the act focuses on regulating interactions between debt collectors and consumers.ellis,as a natural person obligated or allegedly obligated to pay any debt,clearly fits the definition of consumer,and the parties agree that the defendants are debt collectors.see heintz jenkins,d.
fdcpa,validation of debts,was enacted to eliminate the recurring problem of debt collectors dunning the wrong person or attempting to collect debts which the consumer has already paid,at,reprinted in,see also bartlett heibl,cir these provisions are intended for the case in which the debt collector,being a hireling of the creditor rather than the creditor itself,may lack knowledge of the debt.unless set forth in the debt collector initial communication with the consumer,the debt collector must send the consumer a written validation notice within five
