these consolidated appeals arise from a lease of a toyota the toyota by plaintiff and appellant katrina lachapelle from faa concord t,incorporated the dealer.the lease agreement recites,among other things,that the value of the toyota was,the gross capitalized cost would be and the residual value at the end of the lease would be.appellant agreed to pay at the time of the lease signing or delivery and to make additional monthly payments of.at the end of the lease term she was to have the option of purchasing the toyota for defined as its residual value.the agreement further recites that appellant was trading in a honda civic the honda.blanks for the value of the honda,and for the value that would be applied against the gross capitalized cost of the toyota,however,were marked.
by her complaint,appellant alleged that she leased the toyota only after the dealer told her that she could not qualify for a purchase loan,and the only means by which she could acquire the toyota was by leasing it.the dealer allegedly concealed that appellant would pay more for leasing the toyota than for purchasing it,and falsely represented that she could convert the lease to a purchase without penalty if she were to make a substantial down payment at some later date.appellant sought rescission of the agreement and damages,alleging that the transaction violated various provisions of the vehicle leasing act vlap,et the consumers legal remedies act crla,et and california unfair competition laws bus,et.appellant vla and clra claims were asserted not only against the dealer,but also against toyota lease trust,the agency that financed the transaction,and toyota motor credit corporation,to whom the lease was assigned.toyota lease trust and toyota motor credit corporation are the respondents in these consolidated appeals.

appeal no.judgment 
of good faith settlement with the dealer 
as a threshold issue,respondents claim that appellant entered into a good faith settlement agreement with the dealer by which appellant,among other things,released respondents from all liability.the settlement agreement submitted by respondents in support of this argument,however,is unsigned.we have augmented the record to include a copy of the signed agreement,which,unlike the draft submitted by respondents,does not release the dealer assigns.as respondents liability,if any,arises from their status as assignees of the lease,the settlement agreement does not act to release them from that liability.

vehicle leasing act 
the vla regulates the leasing of automobiles.as relevant here,civil code section states requirements for the form of the lease agreement,and sets forth the terms that must be contained in a single document to be furnished to the lessee before the leased vehicle may be delivered to the lessee.section imposes civil liability on the lessor for failing to comply with the act,also allowing a lessee to recover any actual damages sustained as the result of such failure.section permits the lessee to seek rescission as an alternative to an action brought under section.
two provisions of the act expressly pertain to assignees such as respondents.
civil code section subdivision e,provides 
except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter,any civil action for a violation of this chapter which may be brought against the original lessor in any lease transaction may be maintained against any subsequent assignee of the original lessor where the violation from which the alleged liability arose is apparent on the face of the lease instrument assigned unless the assignment is involuntary.
civil code section provides 
a an assignee of the lessor rights is subject to all equities and defenses of the lessee against the lessor,notwithstanding an agreement to the contrary,but the assignee liability may not exceed the amount of the obligation owing to the assignee at the time of the assignment.
b the assignee shall have recourse against the lessor to the extent of any liability incurred by the assignee pursuant to this section regardless of whether the assignment was with or without recourse.
appellant claims 
appellant cites civil code section,subdivision c a,which requires every lease contract to disclose t he value of the vehicle as equipped at the time of the lease.appellant contended in the trial court that the defendants violated the act because the lease agreement falsely reported the value of the toyota as,when,in fact,the dealer had not even mentioned the value of the toyota.appellant contended that a second violation occurred because the lease agreement failed to describe her honda as a vehicle or to state any gross value assigned to the honda.appellant sought actual damages,rescission of the lease,restitution,civil penalties,punitive damages and attorney fees.
in granting summary judgment to respondents,the trial court found that neither violation alleged by appellant was apparent on the face of the lease,and that respondents,as assignees of the lease,therefore could not be held liable for the alleged violations.the court further concluded that the fact that the alleged violations did not appear on the face of the lease agreement not only precluded appellant from seeking damages and civil penalties from respondents,but also precluded her from seeking rescission of the lease agreement against them.
appellant argues that summary judgment was improper because there is a triable issue of fact as to whether respondents connection with the dealer and the lease agreement was such that they should be characterized not simply as assignees,but lessors under the act that at least one alleged violation appears on the face of the lease and that the face of the instrument limitation of civil code section does not apply to rescission actions.
respondents as lessors 
the first of appellant respondents must be characterized as lessors for purposes of the not raised by her in the trial court.the validity of such an argument turns on the facts in any particular case,whether an assignee connection with the original purchase or lease transaction is so close as to justify viewing the assignee as the original creditor.see ford motor credit cenance,d,and boncyk cavanaugh motors cir.appellant is not entitled to raise for the first time on appeal a theory that involves a controverted factual situation not put in issue below.city of san diego rider th,d.
appellant,in her reply brief,claims that she did put into issue the question of respondents status as lessors,citing arguments made in connection with the federal trade commission holder rule,code of federal regulations,section the record,however,does not bear out this claim.
appellant argued in the trial court,as she argues here,that she is entitled to seek rescission from respondents even if the violations of the act alleged by her do not appear on the face of the lease,because civil code section provides that the rights of an assignee are subject to all equities and defenses of the lessee against the lessor.appellant claimed,in part,that in order to make the vla consistent with the holder rule,the vla,through section,must be construed to permit lessees to state affirmative claims against assignees even when a basis for those claims does not appear on the face of the lease.
the holder rule requires credit consumer contracts to provide notice that any holder of the contract is subject to all claims and defenses that a buyer could assert against the seller,and appellant argued that it follows that respondents,as assignees,were subject to any claims she could have asserted against the dealer.nonetheless,in what appears to be little more than an afterthought,appellant also asserted that a seller under is defined as including a person who,in the ordinary course of business,leases goods to consumers.when that sic toyota motor credit accepts assignment of a lease contract from the leasing dealer,it in effect becomes a lessor,a person who leases goods and is therefore subject to the holder rule.appellant supported this an assignee is subject to the holder rule not just as an assignee but as a a footnote reference to the federal reserve board official staff commentary on regulation,implementing the consumer leasing portions of the tila,and also to ford motor cenance,supra,d,which appellant cited as authority for the proposition that an assignee may be a lessor.
we do not view this an assignee is subject to the tila holder encompassing an assertion that respondents are lessors under the vla.moreover,ford motor cenance,supra,establishes only that there are circumstances under which an assignee may be deemed a creditor for purposes of the tila.finally,even if the holding in cenance could be extended to support an assertion that there are circumstances in which an assignee may be deemed a lessor under the vla,and even if appellant assertions in the trial court could be characterized as the argument that respondents should be deemed to be lessors,the merits of such an argument necessarily turn on the facts present in a given transaction.appellant stated no facts to support her claims.appellant,accordingly,provided no basis for a ruling that respondents were lessors under the vla.
the face of the lease instrument 
appellant has not renewed her argument that respondents might be liable for the alleged failure of the dealer to negotiate an value of the toyota,apparently recognizing that because the lease agreement recites an value of,the dealer failure,if any,does not appear on the face of the lease agreement.she claims only that the face of the lease instrument discloses a discrepancy relating to the value of her honda,and a violation of the federal trade commission ftc holder rule.
civil code section,subdivision c requires every lease to include a brief description of each vehicle or other property being traded in and the value thereof if the amount due at the time of signing the lease or upon delivery is paid in whole or in part with a net allowance or the itemization of gross capitalized cost includes any portion of the outstanding prior credit or lease balance from the property.the lease recites that appellant traded in a honda civic,but a blank for net trade in allowance is filled in with the notation.
appellant contended in the trial court that it therefore appears from the face of the lease that there had been a violation of civil code section.by its terms,civil code section,however,requires disclosure of an value of a vehicle only if the amounts due or owed as a result of the are made part of the financing of the lease.in the present case,as appellant conceded in the trial court,she received cash,in the form of a check,for her equity in the honda.it appears that the dealer handled appellant as a courtesy to appellant,and,after the value of the was determined,sent her a check for her equity interest in the honda.the was not a part of the financing for the lease.
appellant does not renew the specific argument made by her in the trial court,arguing instead that the face of the lease reveals a violation of the single document rule of civil code section,subdivision a every lease contract shall be in writing and shall contain in a single document all of the agreements of the lessor and lessee with respect to the obligations of each party.appellant apparently contends that noting the of the honda,but not assigning it a value,established on the face of the lease that the parties entered into a transaction that was not detailed in the lease agreement.
the single document rule can not reasonably be read as requiring a lease agreement to detail a transaction that is not a part of the lease transaction.a main purpose of the vla,including the single document rule,is to protect consumers by improving the disclosure of lease terms and standardizing lease requirements.assem.com.on appropriations,analysis of bill reg.sess,com.aug,and see kroupa sunrise ford th,fn,d.this purpose would be hindered,rather than furthered,by compelling dealers to place terms of a separate transaction on the face of the lease agreement.such a requirement could only lead consumers to conclude,incorrectly,that the terms of the separate transaction have some bearing on the terms of the lease.it follows that a dealer failure to recite the terms of a agreement on the face of a lease does not violate the single document rule unless that agreement is a part of the lease agreement.it further follows that the fact that a lease agreement notes a but does not set forth the details of that transaction,does not demonstrate,on the face of the lease agreement,that the single document rule has been violated.
kroupa sunrise ford,supra,th,d,cited by appellant,does not support her claim that the lease agreement here was required to disclose the terms of the.the plaintiffs in that case traded in two vehicles in connection with the lease of a truck.they had a negative equity in both vehicles,and the transaction included the application of the negative proceeds of the two to the lease.the appellate court,accordingly,determined that the and the lease were part of a single transaction.appellant citation to kroupa would be persuasive if appellant equity in the honda had been applied to her lease,but as it was not,the reasoning followed by the court in kroupa has no application here.
it also is not persuasive that the trial court in the present case denied a motion for summary judgment,filed by the dealer,finding,in part,that material issues of fact existed as to whether the lease agreement met the single document rule.appellant made claims against the dealer that she did not make against respondents.she claimed,for example,that the dealer representative had made a number of promises that were not reflected in the lease agreement.she also claimed that she never discussed the value of the toyota with the dealer,and complained that the lease agreement nonetheless set forth an value for that vehicle.these claims involved issues of fact,and the trial courtpresumably determined that they might,in some way,implicate the single document rule.there is no reason to read the court ruling as a finding that there was a disputed issue of fact relating to appellant claim that the failure to list the transaction violated the single document rule.
the ftc holder rule 
as discussed above,the ftc holder rule requires consumer credit contracts to recite that any holder of the contract is subject to all claims and defenses that the debtor could assert against the seller.the lease agreement at issue here does not contain such a notice,and appellant claims that this failure is a defect appearing on the face of the lease.
for purposes of the rule,a consumer credit contract is defined as a ny instrument which evidences or embodies a debt arising from a purchase money loan transaction or a financed sale,subd.i.a purchase money loan transaction involves a cash advance received by the customer,subd.d.appellant did not receive a cash advance.financing a sale refers to e xtending credit to a consumer in connection with a credit sale within the meaning of the truth in lending act and regulation,subd.e.regulation z defines a credit sale as a sale in which the seller is the creditor,and the consumer agrees to pay an amount substantially equivalent to or in excess of the total value of the property involved,and either will become,or has the option of becoming,the owner of the property upon compliance with the agreement for no additional consideration or for nominal consideration,subd.a.here,although the lease agreement gave appellant the option of becoming the owner of the toyota at the termination of the lease,she could do so only by paying amount that can not be characterized as nominal.the lease agreement therefore does meet the definition of a consumer credit contract,and that the ftc holder rule,therefore,does not apply to it.
civil code section and the right to rescind 
as noted above,a n assignee of the lessor rights is subject to all equities and defenses of the lessee against the lessor,notwithstanding an agreement to the contrary,but the assignee liability may not exceed the amount of the obligation owing to the assignee at the time of the assignment,subd.a.appellant,pointing out that civil code section confers on lessees the right to rescind as an alternative to seeking relief under civil code section,contends that her right to rescind against the lessor for a violation of the vla is an equity or defense that may be raised not only against the lessor,but against an assignee.
in civil code section,the legislature struck a balance between the interests of innocent lessees and innocent assignees,creating liability on the part of assignees for a dealer violations of the vla only when the violation appears on the face of the lease and therefore should be apparent to the assignee.it would be odd,indeed,if the legislature,having determined that the competing interests should be balanced in that manner,also established a kind of back door liability for assignees by means of civil code section.it is far more likely that the legislature simply recognized that lessees have equities and defenses against assignees aside from the remedies provided by the vla,and adopted section to prevent any limitation of those equities and defenses.a lessee,for example,has the right to rescind the contract if the contract was induced by fraud,or if the vehicle is wholly defective.section reasonably can be read as affirming that this right to rescind survives any assignment of the lease,as opposed to providing that lessees can rescind a lease agreement for a violation of the vla notwithstanding that the assignee is unaware of the violation and notwithstanding the face of the lease limitation of civil code section.
our construction of civil code section is supported by the fact that the section was patterned after similar provisions in the unruh act,and the rees levering act,and by the legislative history of all three acts.at the time vla was adopted,in stats,ch,operative march,retail installment sales generally were regulated by the unruh act,and installment sales of motor vehicles,in particular,were regulated by the rees levering act.it long had been recognized that buyers under installment sales contracts had the right to raise against assignees any defenses they might have against sellers and both acts protected consumers from any attempt to limit this right by means of a contractual waiver although both acts protected the same right,they used different language,and in,both were amended to employ identical later adopted in civil code section.stats,ch,and.
in,the supreme court decided vasquez superior court cal d.one of the issues in vasquez was whether civil code section should be read as precluding a buyer from bringing an affirmative action against an assignee for rescission when the assignee had notice of a defense to the contract at that time,section provided that the rights of a buyer under the section could be asserted only as a defense to a claim by the assignee.the court found that the defense only limitation of section did not apply if the assignee had taken the contract with notice of the buyer defenses.vasquez superior court,supra,cal d at.several months later,senator george moscone,by means of senate bill,proposed an amendment of civil code sections and to clarify the law in light of the decision in vasquez.among other things,senator moscone proposed the removal of the defense only limitation.recognizing the concern that removal of this language might expose assignees to claims for injury to person or property,senator moscone further proposed that a buyer rights against an assignee should be limited to the amount due on the contract at the time the assignee received notice of the buyer defenses and equities.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.the legislature ultimately adopted senator moscone proposal,except that it limited the buyer rights against an assignee to the amount of the debt owing at the time of the assignment.
the legislative history of the language in civil code sections,and,ultimately,therefore indicates an intent to carry forward consumers existing common law rights against assignees as an adjunct to consumer protection legislation.it does not indicate an intent to add to the statutory remedies available to consumers for violations of the relevant act by authorizing rescission against an assignee even when a violation does not appear on the face of the contract.
we hold that a lessee has a right to rescind the lease agreement,notwithstanding its assignment,for a violation of the vla,only if the violation appears on the face of the lease,and the buyer therefore would be entitled to a remedy against the assignee under civil code section,subdivision e.as we find no violation appearing on the face of the lease agreement,we further find that appellant asserted no basis for relief against respondents under the vla.
california uniform commercial codecalifornia uniform commercial code section 
california uniform commercial code section provides,in subdivision e,that a transfer of the lease or of all my rights under the lease,or a transfer in similar general terms,is a transfer of rights and,unless the language or the circumstances,as in a transfer for security,indicate the contrary,the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the transferee.acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by the transferee to perform those duties.the promise is enforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease.
appellant contends that under this section,the dealer,in assigning the lease to respondents,must be deemed also to have delegated to them its duties,including the duty to comply with the vla and the clra.the dealer obligations under the vla or the clra were or the time the parties entered into the lease agreement.the dealer could not delegate to respondents the duty to do something that was done before the assignment.indeed,appellant is not actually arguing that the dealer delegated those duties.she is arguing that respondents are responsible for the lessor failure to comply with its statutory duties.nothing in california uniform commercial code section suggests that an assignment includes a duty to guarantee that the assignor previously executed contractual duties were performed properly.in all events,california uniform commercial code section provides that where a conflict exists between a provision of the california uniform commercial code and a consumer law of this state,the latter controls.california uniform commercial code section,therefore,can not be read as overriding the limitations on consumer rights set forth in the vla and clra.
appellant also cites california uniform commercial code section,subdivision a,which provides that the right to enforce the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is subject to a claim in recoupment of the obligor against the original payee of the instrument if the claim arose from the transaction that gave rise to the instrument but the claim of the obligor may be asserted
