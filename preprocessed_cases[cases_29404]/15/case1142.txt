michael avery and other named plaintiffs brought a class action in the circuit court of williamson county against defendant,state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm.representing a nearly nationwide class of state farm policyholders,plaintiffs alleged claims sounding in breach of contract and statutory consumer fraud,in addition to a claim seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.
the circuit court certified the class.the breach of contract claim was tried before a jury,and the remaining claims received a simultaneous bench trial.the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim,and the circuit court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the consumer fraud claim.with regard to the third count,the circuit court granted declaratory relief but declined to grant injunctive relief.the damages awarded to plaintiffs totaled.
the appellate court affirmed the judgment,with one exception.the appellate court reversed a portion of the damages,lowering the total award to.d.we allowed state farm petition for leave to appeal.a.
plaintiffs suit centers on certain automobile repair part categories which have been identified in the record and to which we refer throughout our discussion.crash parts refers to automobile components that are used to replace parts damaged in a crash,rather than parts that have failed mechanically.they are primarily sheet metal and plastic parts that are attached to the outer shell of the car.crash parts consist of two categories.the first category is comprised of new parts made by or on behalf of the automobile original manufacturer.these parts are commonly referred to as original equipment manufacturer parts,or oem crash parts.the second class includes aftermarket parts made by companies not affiliated with original equipment manufacturers.these parts are referred to as crash parts 
a succinct general overview of plaintiffs theory of the case may be found in plaintiff memorandum in support of application of illinois law to the claims of class members under illinois choice of law doctrine 
in this case,plaintiffs have placed at issue the propriety of state farm uniform practice of specifying the use of crash parts to repair its policyholders car s in every instance in which such cheaper parts are available.plaintiffs contend that this policy breaches state farm standard contract because it is not designed to restore policyholders cars to their condition by using parts of like kind and quality.plaintiffs further contend that this practice violates illinois consumer law because the practice itself and its economic ramifications constitute a violation of illinois consumer statutes,which prohibit misrepresentations as to the standard,quality,or grade of the goods and services provided under state farm policies.citation.at trial,the court and jury must resolve the classwide question of whether state farm,by requiring the uniform use of crash parts,and through the course of conduct it designed to conceal the true import of this practice from its policyholders,breached its contractual obligations and committed consumer fraud.
this opinion is divided into two principal sections breach of contract and consumer fraud.in a third section,we deal with plaintiffs claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.these sections are further subdivided,as required by the various arguments and issues,as follows

we begin with plaintiffs breach of contract count.
breach of contract 
plaintiffs original class action complaint,which was filed in july,was amended several times.the trial,which took place in,was predicated upon plaintiffs third amended class action complaint.count i breach of contract of the third amended complaint alleged that state farm breached its uniform insurance contract with its policyholders.plaintiffs alleged that,under the terms of this contract,state farm promised to restore plaintiffs vehicles to their condition using parts of like kind and quality.according to plaintiffs,the term like kind and quality,as stated in this promise,meant like kind and quality to oem parts.however,plaintiffs also alleged that the parts at issue in this case were categorically inferior to their oem counterparts.under plaintiffs view,parts could never satisfy state farm like kind and quality obligation.plaintiffs alleged as a practical matter,state farm obligation could be met only by requiring the exclusive use in repairs of or oem parts.emphases added.
in urging the certification of their claim as a class action,plaintiffs alleged that state farm contractual agreement with its policyholders was a uniform policy,in the singular,with the same or common general terms.state farm argued,to the contrary,that there was no uniform state farm automobile insurance policy nationwide,and individual issues therefore would dominate the contract claims,rendering classwide determinations impossible.see ilcs west.according to state farm,some of its policies included a promise to pay to repair the vehicle with parts of like kind and quality,but other policies did not contain this provision.state farm added that,in many states,its policies explicitly provided for the specification of parts sufficient to restore the vehicle to its condition.still other state farm automobile insurance policies contained neither the like kind and quality nor the condition language.state farm pointed,for example,to its massachusetts policies,which promised simply to pay the actual cash value of parts at the time of the collision.another group of policies that contained neither the like kind and quality nor the condition language were the majority of state farm assigned risk contracts,which were written for the residual market of consumers whom states required insurers to cover.according to state farm,most of these assigned risk policies promised simply to pay the a mount necessary to repair or replace the property.
state farm also argued that there were substantive conflicts of law between illinois and other states,and therefore it would be improper to apply illinois law to the contract claims of class members nationwide.state farm contended,in addition,that illinois lacked significant contacts with the claims of class members in other states and the imposition of illinois law with regard to their claims would violate constitutional rights.see phillips petroleum shutts,d.
following a hearing,the circuit court certified plaintiffs claims as a class action.the circuit court rejected state farm arguments,finding that illinois law could be applied to the claims of the entire class and that this imposition of illinois law presented no constitutional difficulties.the court also rejected state farm argument that there was no standard form insurance policy.the court took the position that the specific form of the individual policies was immaterial so long as the operative contractual language in each policy was susceptible of uniform interpretation.the court declined to address this issue at the certification stage,maintaining instead that the question of whether the language in state farm various policies could be given a uniform interpretation should be resolved at trial.
in reaching its decision to certify the class,the court concluded that there were questions of fact or law that were common to the class,and these questions predominated over any questions affecting only individual members.ilcs west.the court pointed to what it termed state farm uniform practice throughout the united states of specifying parts on policyholders repair estimates.according to the court,the members of the plaintiff class had a common interest in determining whether this practice constituted a breach of state farm contractual obligation.in the court view,this common interest predominated over questions affecting individual class members.
in an order regarding law to be applied to class members claims,the circuit court explained its reasoning for applying illinois law to class members claims nationwide.the court stated 
with respect to the breach of contract claims,the court finds that there are no true conflicts of law raised by the specific claims or facts at issue in this case which require application of the law of any state other than illinois.illinois possesses sufficient contacts such that the application of illinois law to the breach of contract claims in this case is neither arbitrary nor unfair and comports with due process.application of illinois law to the breach of contract claims does not implicate the interests of any other jurisdiction and application of its law to these claims.finally,the application of illinois breach of contract standards,which are identical to those in other jurisdictions,does not interfere with any state legislative or legal choices.
based on its finding that class members had a common interest in determining whether state farm uniform practice of specifying parts breached state farm contractual obligation,and that illinois law could be applied to class members claims nationwide,the circuit court certified the following class 
all persons in the united states,except those residing in arkansas and tennessee,who,between july,and february,were insured by a vehicle casualty insurance policy issued by defendant state farm and made a claim for vehicle repairs pursuant to their policy and had authorized original equipment manufacturer crash parts installed on their vehicles or else received monetary compensation determined in relation to the cost of such parts.excluded from the class are employees of defendant state farm,its officers,its directors,its subsidiaries,or its affiliates.
in addition,the following persons are excluded from the class persons who resided or garaged their vehicles in illinois and whose illinois insurance policies were prior to april,and persons who resided in california and whose policies were prior to september.
following entry of the circuit court order certifying the class,state farm sought from this court a writ of mandamus directing the circuit court to reverse the order.state farm suggested in the alternative that this court reverse the circuit court certification order pursuant to our supervisory authority.state farm also moved for transfer,consolidation,and a stay of proceedings.this court entered an order in which we took no action on state farm various requests because there were insufficient votes either to allow or to deny.
in the circuit court,state farm subsequently moved for summary judgment on the class claims and for decertification of the class.the circuit court denied these motions.state farm also moved for summary judgment against each of the named plaintiffs.this motion was denied as well.
prior to trial,the parties tendered a number of motions in limine.one of plaintiffs motions sought to bar state farm from presenting evidence to the jury that the regulation of insurance varied from state to state,and another of plaintiffs motions sought to prohibit any disclosure of the states where the class members policies were filed.still another of plaintiffs motions sought to preclude the introduction of evidence regarding differences in state farm contractual obligations to class members.in opposing these motions,state farm argued,as it had in opposing class certification,that there were significant variances in its contractual obligations to the members of the class,and these variances resulted,at least in part,from differing insurance regulations in the various states.state farm asserted 
n othing is more basic in the trial of a contract claim than that the rights and duties of the parties to a contract are defined by that specific contract.but plaintiffs ask to exclude that very starting point,t he contract of the individual class members,a contract which varies depending on troublesome differences in state farm obligations toward members of the class.the contractual rights of the members of the class,your honor,do vary,and those variances are not only relevant but fundamental.
the circuit court granted several of plaintiffs motions in limine,including those barring state farm from disclosing the states where the class members policies were filed,introducing evidence regarding variances in the states insurance regulations,and introducing evidence regarding differences in state farm contractual obligations to members of the class.
the trial began on august.as previously indicated,the breach of contract claim was tried before the jury,and the remaining claims were tried before the court after the jury had left for the day.at the start of the trial,and over the objection of state farm,the circuit court gave preliminary jury instructions.in these instructions,the court told the jury that state farm contractual obligation was exactly the same,whether state farm promised to pay for crash parts of like kind and quality or promised to pay for crash parts which restore a vehicle to its condition.the court added that,under state farm policies,the company was allowed to specify either oem parts or parts,so long as the crash parts are of like kind and quality which restore the damaged vehicle to its condition.according to the circuit court,crash parts were of like kind and quality only if they restore d a vehicle to its condition,which the court defined as the condition of the vehicle immediately prior to the time it is damaged.
it is unnecessary to recount in detail the evidence presented at trial.we note that the trial lasted several days,and involved hundreds of exhibits and testimony by dozens of witnesses.much of the testimony dealt with whether parts were categorically inferior to oem parts.each side presented the testimony of experts and witnesses in support of their respective positions.at this point,we summarize only the testimony of the named plaintiffs,the testimony of plaintiffs damages expert,and that of a state farm claims consultant.other facts relevant to our analysis will be introduced as they become pertinent.
five named plaintiffs testified at trial.michael avery,of louisiana,testified by video deposition.the remaining four gave their testimony in person mark covington,a resident of mississippi sam defrank,who lived in illinois carly vickers,a resident of pennsylvania and todd shadle,who was living in massachusetts when his accident occurred.
two of the witnesses,avery and shadle,did not have parts installed on their vehicles.both testified that before their respective accidents,their cars were in very good condition,and they would not consider parts.accordingly,both had oem parts installed on their vehicles,rather than the parts specified in the estimate,and both paid the difference in cost.for shadle,the difference was about,and for avery it was about.
covington,defrank and vickers did have parts installed on their vehicles.all three expressed dissatisfaction with the parts.vickers testified that,following the collision that gave rise to her suit,her car was involved in a subsequent,more serious accident and was declared a total loss.vickers admitted that state farm paid her book value for the car.she added that,so far as she knew,state farm did not value her car any less because of the parts that had been used in its repair.defrank testified that,several months after his truck was repaired,he sold the vehicle to his for an amount that was slightly below blue book value.however,defrank asserted that,even though the truck had been repaired with parts,he did not discount the sale price based on this fact.defrank characterized the sale of the truck to his as an arm length transaction.
plaintiffs damages expert,iqbal mathur,testified that there were two types of damages being sought for breach of contract.the first was what mathur termed direct,or specification,damages.according to mathur,these damages were incurred when state farm specified a part on the repair estimate.under this theory,everyone in the class was eligible to receive specification damages.
on,mathur acknowledged that a plaintiff would be entitled to receive specification damages even if his car were restored to its preloss condition.mathur also conceded that specification damages would apply even if the car were repaired with an oem part or with a part that was of the same quality as an oem part.
the second type of contract damages,which mathur described as consequential,or installation,damages,was determined by calculating the cost of replacing parts with oem parts on a class member vehicle.only those class members who actually had parts installed on their vehicles were eligible to receive installation damages.
on,mathur acknowledged that,with regard to installation damages,it was necessary to determine whether a part was installed on a class member vehicle.however,mathur conceded that he had no way of making this determination.mathur also acknowledged that he had no opinion as to how many class members had parts installed on their vehicles but later received fair market value for them.mathur admitted that his calculations as to installation damages might be incorrect by as much as billion.
among the witnesses appearing for defendant was don porter,a state farm property consultant in auto general claims.porter testimony was directed primarily to state farm basic philosophy of handling auto damage claims,rather than any specific contractual obligation.in describing this philosophy,porter testified repeatedly that state farm goal was to pay to restore a policyholder car to its preloss condition.according to porter,state farm has always had a commitment to restoring the vehicle to its condition.porter also testified that the parts specified must be as good as the part that was on the car prior to the loss.porter never mentioned the massachusetts or assigned risk policies,and never stated that all the state farm policy forms at issue in this case were uniform.
following the close of evidence,the circuit court,in conferring with the parties,reiterated the view that state farm contractual obligation was the same for each member of the class.in describing this uniform obligation,the circuit court pointed to porter testimony.according to the court,porter testified that state farm promise always was that when the car was repaired,the parts would be of like kind and quality which restores the vehicle to its condition.the court ruled that this uniform interpretation of the contractual obligation would apply to all of state farm policies,including the assigned risk policies and the massachusetts policies neither of which contained the like kind and quality or the condition language.
during the conference on jury instructions,state farm objected to the use of the term contract in the instructions state farm argued reference to a singular contract is factually inaccurate.there were numerous contracts.counsel for state farm informed the circuit court that,with regard to the court interpretation of the contractual obligation as uniform,state farm wanted to preserve its objections as to variations in contract terms based on either differing policy language or differing state regulations.counsel stated 
we understand that not going to be a part of this trial.so we merely want to preserve that for appellate purposes.
the circuit court noted the objection,and subsequently instructed the jury.the instructions regarding state farm contractual obligation essentially repeated what the court had given in its preliminary instructions.the essence of these contractual obligation instructions was that state farm contractual obligation was the same for every class member.
the verdict form given by the circuit court was general and classwide.it stated,in pertinent part do you find that defendant state farm failed to perform its obligations under the contract and breached its contract with the plaintiff class the circuit court denied state farm request to give,in addition,individual verdict forms for each named plaintiff.
the jury found that defendant state farm failed to perform its obligations under the contract and breached its contract with the plaintiff class.contract damages awarded to the plaintiff class totaled,which consisted of in specification damages and in installation damages.the circuit court entered judgment on the jury verdict in favor of plaintiffs on the contract claim.the court also entered judgment in plaintiffs favor on the consumer fraud claim,finding that state farm had,by its practices,violated the consumer fraud act.the court awarded plaintiffs an additional million in disgorgement damages and million in punitive damages,resulting in a total award of on all claims.
on appeal,state farm argued that,with regard to plaintiffs breach of contract claim,individual questions predominated over any purported common questions,and the claim for breach of contract therefore should not have been certified as a class action.ilcs west.in its brief to the appellate court,state farm contended that,contrary to the conclusion of the circuit court,the operative contractual language in state farm policies was not susceptible of uniform interpretation.while acknowledging that most of its auto insurance contracts contained the like kind and quality or the condition language,state farm insisted that a significant number of policies did not.state farm pointed,for example,to its policies in massachusetts,as well as its assigned risk policies in alaska,illinois,indiana,and minnesota,which state farm averred did not use either the like kind and quality or condition language.in its brief to the appellate court,state farm asserted 
neither of these formulations the massachusetts policy provision or the assigned risk policy provision expressly imposes any standard of part quality.in fact,the assigned risk policies deliberately delete the like kind and quality and condition language that appears in other state farm policies.emphases in original.
focusing on the circuit court interpretation of its contractual obligation as uniform,state farm told the appellate court 
rather than trying to deal with the variations in policy language and the governing state laws,the circuit court chose to ignore them completely.the court instructed the jury that there was only one policy form,even though there are a number of different forms.then the court made up its own interpretation of that policy form,without citing any law to support it.finally,in order to enforce the artificial uniformity it had created,the court barred state farm from telling the jury about any different contract language or differing state laws governing the specification of parts.
the circuit court decision to force this case into the mold of a class action by fabricating a single contract and a single interpretation is an error of law of constitutional dimension that requires reversal by this court.
the appellate court affirmed the certification of plaintiffs breach of contract claim as a class action.the appellate court concluded,as had the circuit court,that state farm contractual promise was the same for each member of the class.the appellate court stated 
the record demonstrates that plaintiffs presented evidence to show that state farm made the same promise,to pay for parts of like kind and quality to restore condition to its policyholders throughout the country.state farm own witness,don porter,a claims consultant,acknowledged that state farm had a uniform nationwide obligation to policyholders.this promise was to specify parts of like kind and quality to oem parts so as to restore preloss condition.emphasis added.d at.
the appellate court also affirmed the circuit court finding that illinois law could be applied to the contract claims of all the class members nationwide and that this imposition of illinois law presented no constitutional difficulties.
with regard to the merits,the appellate court upheld the circuit court judgment that state farm breached its contractual obligation to the plaintiff class.the appellate court stated 
plaintiffs claimed that the parts specified by state farm were categorically inferior and failed to restore the vehicles to their condition.the claim was supported with expert testimony,from which it could be reasonably inferred,if accepted as true,that the lot of parts specified by state farm was inferior in terms of appearance,fit,quality,function,durability,and performance.d at.
the appellate court also upheld most of the damages awarded for breach of contract.in affirming the award of specification damages,the appellate court explicitly concluded that these damages applied even where an inferior part was specified on the estimate,but the body shop provided an oem part at no additional cost to the class member,and parts were used in the vehicle repair,but the class member subsequently sold the vehicle for fair market value with no diminution in value because of the use of parts.d at.the appellate court also upheld the award of installation damages,rejecting state farm criticism that these damages were speculative.d at.
however,the appellate court concluded that the million in disgorgement damages constituted an impermissible double recovery,and the appellate court therefore reversed this award.as a result,plaintiffs total award was reduced to.
state farm appeals from those portions of the judgment of the appellate court affirming the judgment of the circuit court we granted state farm petition for leave to appeal.a.
propriety of the nationwide contract class 
before this court,state farm argues,as it did before the circuit and appellate courts,that the class should not have been certified.state farm contends that individual questions predominate over any questions common to the class and that illinois law should not have been applied to the contract claims of class members nationwide.with regard to the merits,state farm argues that plaintiffs failed to establish a breach of state farm contractual obligation and plaintiffs failed to establish that they were entitled to damages.we turn first to state farm contention that the class should not have been certified.
class certification is governed by section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west,which is patterned after rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.see getto city of chicago,forde,illinois new class action statute,chi.rec.given the relationship between these two provisions,federal decisions interpreting rule are persuasive authority with regard to questions of class certification in illinois.see,schlessinger olsen,citing.case in analyzing class certification issue see forde,illinois new class action statute,chi.rec,southwestern refining bernal.under section,a class may be certified only if the proponent establishes the four prerequisites set forth in the statute numerosity t he class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable commonality t here are questions of fact or law common to the class,which common questions predominate over any questions affecting only individual members adequacy of representation t he representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the class and appropriateness t he class action is an appropriate method for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.ilcs west.
decisions regarding class certification are within the sound discretion of the trial court and should be overturned only where the court clearly abused its discretion or applied impermissible legal criteria.mccabe burgess,eshaghi hanley dawson cadillac,d.however,a trial court discretion in deciding whether to certify a class action is not unlimited and is bounded by and must be exercised within the framework of the civil procedure rule governing class actions.conte newberg,newberg on class actions,at ed see also broussard meineke discount muffler shops,cir noting that,while a trial court has broad discretion in deciding whether to certify a class,this discretion must be exercised within the framework of.
in the case at bar,state farm argues that it was an abuse of discretion to certify the class.state farm argument focuses on the commonality and predominance requirement of section.according to state farm,it was error for the lower courts to conclude that common questions predominated over questions affecting only individual class members.
with regard to the class that was certified for plaintiffs contract claim,the common question identified by the circuit court in its certification order was whether state farm practice of specifying parts on repair estimates constituted a breach of state farm contractual obligations.according to the circuit court,this question of contractual interpretation predominated over other issues.in reaching this conclusion,the circuit court acknowledged state farm argument that its insurance contracts took varying forms and there was thus no standard form contract to be interpreted.however,in the court view,the specific form of the individual insurance policies was immaterial so long as the operative contractual language contained in each policy was susceptible of uniform interpretation.the court concluded that this question of whether the various policies language could be given uniform interpretation should be decided at trial,rather than at the class certification stage.
notwithstanding this assertion by the court,the issue of uniform contractual interpretation was never decided on the merits.as previously noted,prior to trial the circuit court granted plaintiffs motions in limine barring the introduction of evidence regarding differences in state farm contractual obligations and prohibiting any mention of the states where the class members policies were filed.as a result of these rulings,the jury was prevented from hearing evidence regarding any variations in state farm contractual obligations to the class members.moreover,by the time the trial began,the circuit court itself had decided the issue of whether the contractual language in state farm various policies was susceptible of uniform interpretation.in its preliminary instructions to the jury,the court stated the contractual obligation of state farm under its policies or insurance contracts is exactly the same,whether state farm promised to pay for crash parts of like kind and quality or promised to pay for crash parts which restore a vehicle to its condition.emphasis added.following the close of evidence in the jury trial,the circuit court expressed this uniform contractual interpretation in even broader terms,ruling that it applied to all of state farm policies,including the assigned risk policies and the massachusetts policies neither of which contained the like kind and quality or the condition language.
in our view,the circuit court was incorrect in concluding,in the first instance,that the question of uniform contractual interpretation should be decided at trial rather than at the class certification stage.apparently the circuit court came to this realization as well although belatedly,as is evinced by the court deciding the uniform interpretation issue prior to trial.the reason why this question should have been resolved during the certification stage is that,had the court answered the question in the negative rather than the affirmative,the class could not have been certified.in order to satisfy the second requirement of section a common question of fact or law predominates over other questions affecting only individual class members,it must be shown that successful adjudication of the purported class representatives individual claims will establish a right of recovery in other class members.goetz village of hoffman estates,d,accord society of francis dulman,d,hagerty general motors,see also mace van ru credit,cir noting that the typicality and commonality requirements of.ensure that only those plaintiffs or defendants who can advance the same factual and legal arguments may be grouped together as a class.in the case at bar,if the circuit court had concluded that the operative contractual language in state farm various policies was not susceptible of uniform interpretation,this would have raised the possibility that there was a breach of contract with some class members but not with others.see broussard,at.in such a situation,the successful adjudication of the claims of some class members would not necessarily establish a right to recovery in others.if there were significant differences in the operative contractual language of the various policies,the commonality and predominance requirement of section could not be met,and the class could not be certified.accordingly,the circuit court erred in declining to decide the question of uniform contractual interpretation at the class certification stage.as noted,the circuit court apparently realized this error and decided the uniform interpretation issue prior to trial.
the question before us is whether the circuit court decided this issue correctly.in other words,was it error for the circuit court to conclude that the operative language in state farm various policies could be given a uniform interpretation such that the successful adjudication of the contract claims of some class members would establish a right to recovery in other class members the determination of this issue requires an examination of the relevant contracts.the starting point of any contract analysis is the language of the contract itself.church general motors,cir dugan smerwick sewerage,cir.as a general rule,the construction,interpretation,or legal effect of a contract is a matter to be determined by the court as a question of law.prac.contracts,at see chicago daily news,kohler,sindelar liberty mutual insurance,cir.our review of this issue is therefore de novo.see hessler crystal lake,d.
we begin with the two main policy forms at issue in this case.the first includes the like kind and quality language and provides,in pertinent part 
we have the right to settle a loss with you or the owner of the property in one of the following ways 
pay to repair or replace the property or part with like kind and quality.if the repair or replacement results in better than like kind and quality,you must pay for the amount of the betterment.emphases in original.
the second policy form contains the condition provision,as well as language expressly providing that state farm contractual obligation could be met by specifying parts.this policy form states,in pertinent part 
the cost of repair or replacement is based upon one of the following 
an estimate written based upon the prevailing competitive price.we will include in the estimate parts sufficient to restore the vehicle to its condition.you agree with us that such parts may include either parts furnished by the vehicle manufacturer or parts from other sources including equipment manufacturers.emphasis in original.
in our view,these two policy forms are not the same.as noted,the second one contains,in addition to the condition promise,an explicit agreement between state farm and the policyholder regarding the use of parts you agree with us that such parts may include either parts furnished by the vehicle manufacturer or parts from other sources including equipment manufacturers.emphasis in original.in its brief to this court,state farm points in particular to this language,explaining that it expressly provided that state farm could meet the preloss condition obligation by specifying parts.in contrast,the first policy form set forth above,which contains the like kind and quality promise,makes no mention of oem or parts,nor does it expressly allow for the specification of parts.if,as plaintiffs claim,the specification of parts constitutes a breach of state farm contractual obligation,plaintiffs who were insured under policies containing the like kind and quality promise would be in a different position regarding this claim than would plaintiffs with policies containing the you agree language.class members with a like kind and quality policy would have a stronger case for breach of contract than would those whose policies expressly allowed the practice that is alleged to constitute the breach.it follows that the successful adjudication of the claims of class members with the like kind and quality language would not necessarily establish a right of recovery in those with the you agree language.see hagerty,at,goetz,d at,dulman,d at,mace,at.there is thus a material difference between the policies containing the you agree provision and those that do not contain this language 
this difference between the like kind and quality policies,on the one hand,and the condition policies containing the you agree provision,on the other,is not the only instance in this case of material differences in policy language.the putative class also includes state farm insureds with policies that contain neither the like kind and quality nor the condition promise.state farm massachusetts policies,for example,simply promise to pay the actual cash value of parts at the time of the collision.the same is true of most of state farm assigned risk policies,which are used in the residual market of consumers that insurers are required to cover.just as with the massachusetts policies,the majority of the assigned risk policies contain neither the like kind and quality nor the condition language.instead,the assigned risk policies promise to pay an a mount necessary to repair or replace the property.
as state farm points out,neither of these massachusetts policy provision or the assigned risk policy imposes any standard of part quality.it follows that plaintiff class members who were insured under either of these policies would be in a different position than their like kind and quality and condition counterparts regarding the claim that the specification of parts constituted a breach of their insurance contract.the successful adjudication of the claim of a like kind and quality policyholder,for example,would not necessarily establish a right to recovery in a class member with either a massachusetts or an assigned risk policy.see goetz,d at,dulman,d at.
notwithstanding the foregoing,the circuit court,following the close of evidence in the jury trial,reiterated its pretrial conclusion that state farm contractual obligation was the same for each member of the class.the circuit court determined that all of state farm policies,including the massachusetts policies and the assigned risk policies,conveyed the same contractual promise.the court stated 
after having heard all the testimony,and i wrote down in particular when it was done,porter testimony that state farm agreement,promise,however you choose to characterize it,always was that when the car was repaired,the parts would be of like kind and quality which restores it to its condition.
the appellate court also referred specifically to porter testimony in concluding that state farm contractual obligation was uniform state farm own witness,don porter,a claims consultant,acknowledged that state farm had a uniform nationwide obligation to policyholders.d at.plaintiffs take this same position,pointing to porter testimony and contending that state farm contractual obligations to its policyholders were uniform.we disagree.
first,porter testimony about state farm commitment to restoring the vehicle to its condition referred to a basic philosophy goal of the company,rather than a contractual obligation.porter never testified that all of the policy forms at issue in this case were uniform.second,to the extent that his testimony could be read as referring to state farm insurance contracts,the most that can be said about this testimony is that porter was referring to individual policy terms rather than all of the relevant policy forms.viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,porter testimony may be read as supporting the position that the like kind and quality and the condition phrases mean the same thing state farm promised to pay to restore the policyholder vehicle to its preloss condition using parts as good as the parts that were on the vehicle at the time of the loss.however,there is nothing to indicate that porter testimony encompasses any other policy language.
an example of a policy provision that falls outside the scope of porter testimony is the you agree language,which expressly allows for the specification of parts.while porter made brief mention of the you agree language in his testimony,he discussed this language only as an example of the notice that state farm provided to policyholders regarding its practices.porter did not state in his testimony that a policy containing language that expressly allows for the specification of parts is the contractual equivalent of a policy that omits this language.his testimony simply contains no comment with regard to this matter.accordingly,with respect to state farm allegedly uniform contractual obligation,porter testimony supports only the view that the like kind and quality phrase and the condition phrase mean the same thing that state farm obligation was to pay to restore the policyholder vehicle to its preloss condition.porter testimony does not support the position of the lower courts,and of plaintiffs,that the presence of the you agree language makes no difference and that policies containing this language convey the same contractual promise as do policies that omit it.
equally important,porter testimony does not encompass state farm massachusetts policies or its assigned risk policies,neither of which contain the like kind and quality or the condition language.we have carefully examined the more than transcript pages of porter testimony.we find no mention of either the massachusetts policies or the assigned risk policies.the assertion that porter uniform obligation testimony encompasses these policies is simply not supported by the evidence.accordingly,porter testimony does not support the position of the lower courts,and of plaintiffs,that state farm policies which omit the like kind and quality and the condition language state the same contractual promise as policies that include this language.
moreover,there is no other record evidence that can sustain the conclusion that material policy,the you agree language and the assigned risk no difference,and that all of state farm various policy formulations are the same.plaintiffs do point to evidence in addition to porter testimony,but this other evidence consists essentially of statements that are equivalent to porter assertions or reflect them.there is nothing to support the conclusion that the you agree language,for example,or the massachusetts or assigned risk policies are irrelevant and that all of state farm policy variations therefore are susceptible of the same contractual interpretation.indeed,state farm has argued from the beginning of this case that such variances are relevant and that they preclude class certification.
in sum,there is simply no evidentiary support for the lower courts conclusion that all of state farm various policies are uniform.where a putative class includes members who are insured under policies that are materially different,the commonality and predominance requirement of section can not be met.ilcs west.see hagerty,at,goetz,d at,dulman,d at,mace,at.accordingly,it was an abuse of discretion for the circuit court to certify plaintiffs breach of contract claim as a class action.see broussard,at p laintiffs simply can not advance a single collective breach of contract action on the basis of multiple different contracts.we therefore reverse the certification of the nationwide contract class.
whether the verdict may be affirmed with respect to subclasses 
having determined that the certification of the nationwide contract class should be reversed,we note that there remains a question whether the jury breach of contract verdict may be affirmed with regard to any subclass comprised of policyholders who were insured under any of the relevant individual policy forms.for the reasons set forth below,we answer this question in the negative.
we note initially that there are serious questions as to whether the breach of contract verdict may be upheld for any group of class members.under the verdict form given by the circuit court,the jury found that defendant state farm failed to perform its obligations under the contract and breached its contract with the plaintiff class.emphases added.this verdict form followed naturally from the jury instructions,which stated that there was a single contract at issue with a uniform contractual obligation.
however,we have concluded,as a matter of law,that this was error.there was no single contract.rather,there were multiple policy forms which differed materially.on its face,therefore,the verdict is improper.it included no finding,for example,that state farm breached the policy form containing the you agree language,which allowed the practice that plaintiffs claim constituted the breach.indeed,there could not have been such a finding.the jury was never instructed as to the you agree provision.nor was there any finding in the verdict that state farm breached its contractual obligation in the massachusetts policies or the assigned risk policies.once again,the jury was not instructed as to these policies.the verdict simply stated,incorrectly,that state farm breached a single contract with the plaintiff class.
accordingly,the breach of contract verdict can not be upheld with respect to any subclass of policyholders insured under any of the individual policy forms at issue.however,we do not decide this case on this ground alone.instead,we also look at the individual relevant policy forms and consider whether plaintiffs established a breach of any of them.we also consider whether plaintiffs established damages.for the reasons set forth below,we answer these questions in the negative.
the massachusetts and assigned risk policies 
with regard to the massachusetts policies and the assigned risk policies,we conclude that there was no breach.neither of these policy forms contained the like kind and quality or the condition language.the massachusetts policies promised to pay the actual cash value of parts at the time of the collision,and the assigned risk policies promised to pay an a mount necessary to repair or replace the property.as state farm has noted,neither of these massachusetts policy provision or the assigned risk policy imposed any standard of part quality.the specification of parts would not constitute a breach of these contracts.so long as,with regard to the massachusetts policies,state farm paid the actual cash value of parts at the time of the collision,and so long as,with regard to the assigned risk policies,state farm paid an a mount necessary to repair or replace the property,the contractual obligation would be met.it would not matter whether the parts specified were,oem,or some other type.thus,the jury breach of contract verdict may not be affirmed with respect to a subclass consisting of policyholders insured under these provisions.
the you agree policies 
we turn next to the policies containing the condition and the you agree language.as noted,these provisions state 
the cost of repair or replacement is based upon one of the following 
an estimate written based upon the prevailing competitive price.we will include in the estimate parts sufficient to restore the vehicle to its condition.you agree with us that such parts may include either parts furnished by the vehicle manufacturer or parts from other sources including equipment manufacturers.emphasis in original.
we can not affirm the jury verdict with respect to a subclass of policyholders who were insured under these provisions.first,pursuant to the you agree language,the insured expressly agrees that such parts,parts sufficient to restore a vehicle to its preloss condition,may include parts from equipment manufacturers.in other words,the insured agrees that the condition promise may be met by specifying parts.in their brief to this court,plaintiffs do not explain,in any way,how a contract containing the you agree language,which expressly permits the specification of parts,may be breached by the specification of parts.plaintiffs have established,in support of their claim,that parts were specified by state farm in class members estimates.however,in view of the you agree language,this specification of parts,by itself,can not constitute a breach of the condition promise.
second,in order to establish a breach of the condition promise,plaintiffs would have to show that the parts specified or used by state farm,whether oem or parts,did not restore the vehicle to its preloss condition.a necessary first step in making this showing would be to examine each class member vehicle to determine its preloss condition.at trial,timothy ryles and paul griglio,two of plaintiffs expert witnesses,conceded the necessity for such a determination.the following colloquy took place between state farm counsel and ryles 
good point,ryles.to determine whether a particular car has been restored to its condition,you have to know what the condition of that car was is that right 
a.you need to,yes.
griglio made a similar concession in this exchange with state farm counsel 
similarly,sir,to know whether or not a car was restored to condition,you would need to know what the condition of that car was,would you 
yes,you would.
in the case at bar,the determination of the preloss condition of each subclass member vehicle would require the individual examination of hundreds of thousands,if not millions,of vehicles.undoubtedly,these examinations would overwhelm any question common to the subclass,rendering it impossible for such questions to predominate.as noted,class certification is improper unless common questions predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.ilcs west.for this reason,a claim for breach of the preloss condition promise can not be maintained as a class action.see augustus progressive,wl,schwendeman usaa casualty insurance,snell geico,no.civ,slip op.at,wl.august.accordingly,the jury breach of contract verdict may not be affirmed for a subclass comprised of policyholders insured under the preloss condition provision.
the like kind and quality policies 
the remaining policy form is the one containing the like kind and quality promise.before analyzing this provision,we note that the record appears to include the policies of only two of the named plaintiffs,defrank and covington.both defrank and covington policies contain the condition and you agree language.in addition,although we were unable to find a copy of avery policy in the record,testimonial evidence indicates that avery policy also contained the condition and you agree language.
with regard to the remaining two named and record does not appear to include their policies.on this record,therefore,it is unclear that the contracts of any of the named plaintiffs contained the like kind and quality language.if none of the named plaintiffs policies contained the like kind and quality language,state farm could not have breached this provision in any of the named plaintiffs policies.accordingly,plaintiffs claim for breach of the like kind and quality promise fails for lack of proof.we can not uphold a subclass based on this policy form.it is well settled that a class can not be certified unless the named plaintiffs have a cause of action.spring mill townhomes ass osla financial services,d,citing landesman general motors,accord,perlman time,d.assuming,arguendo,that there were named plaintiffs with this policy form,we conclude that there was no breach of the like kind and quality promise.
the like kind and quality promise states 
we have the right to settle a loss with you or the owner of the property in one of the following ways 
pay to repair or replace the property or part with like kind and quality.if the repair or replacement results in better than like kind and quality,you must pay for the amount of the betterment.emphases in original.
according to the appellate court and plaintiffs,like kind and quality,as stated in this promise,meant like kind and quality to oem parts.d at.plaintiffs contention throughout this case has been that the parts that were at issue were categorically inferior to their oem counterparts.it follows that,under this theory,state farm specification of parts could never satisfy the obligation to pay for parts of like kind and quality.in their third amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged as a practical matter,state farm obligation could be met only by requiring the exclusive use in repairs of or oem parts.emphases added.
in our view,there are several difficulties with this theory that the like kind and quality promise is necessarily breached by the specification of parts.first,the language of the promise itself contradicts the view that state farm may meet its contractual obligation only by specifying oem parts.if the purpose of state farm promise to repair or replace the property or part with like kind and quality emphasis added were to require the specification of oem parts,then there is no reason why the indirect phrasing like kind and quality would have been used.the provision could simply have promised that oem parts would be specified.implicit in the phrase like kind and quality is the likeness or similarity of one thing to another.common sense indicates that an item that is of like kind and quality to another is not that very item,but rather is something of like kind and quality to it.
also contradicting the position that like kind and quality means oem parts is the contract language accompanying the like kind and quality promise.in the like kind and quality provision as set forth above,the sentence immediately following the like kind and quality promise states if the repair or replacement results in better than like kind and quality emphasis added,you must pay for the amount of the betterment emphasis in original.this policy language,which requires an insured to pay for repair or replacement which results in better than like kind and quality emphasis added,presumes a standard of quality that is better than like kind and quality.however,under plaintiffs reasoning,there is nothing better than like kind and quality.
recall the position taken by plaintiffs.according to plaintiffs,all the parts at issue in this case are categorically inferior to oem parts.this means,of necessity,that oem parts represent the highest possible standard of quality.in addition,according to plaintiffs,because parts are categorically inferior to oem parts,the like kind and quality promise can only be met by specifying oem parts.thus,because oem parts are the best possible parts,and because the like kind and quality promise means oem parts,plaintiffs also necessarily take the position that the term like kind and quality refers to the highest possible standard of quality.
but this reasoning can not be correct.state farm policy can not be referring to oem parts when it uses the term like kind and quality because the policy itself says that there is a standard of quality which is better than like kind and quality parts.plaintiffs are clearly incorrect in equating like kind and quality with oem parts.
as previously indicated,state farm defines like kind and quality differently from plaintiffs and the appellate court.in state farm view,like kind and quality means sufficient to restore a vehicle to its condition.there is substantial legal support for state farm view.
courts in other jurisdictions have adopted a similar interpretation of the term like kind and quality.in siegle progressive consumers insurance,so d,the issue was whether,under like kind and quality policy language similar to that in the case at bar,an insurer was obligated not only to complete a repair which returns the vehicle to its level of performance,appearance,and function,but also to compensate the insured in money for any diminution in market value that resulted from the repaired vehicle status as a wrecked car.siegle,so d at.the court ruled that there was no such dual obligation on the part of the insurer.the court explained that,under the policy language at issue,the insurer had a choice of either reimbursing the insured through a money payment or paying to repair or replace the automobile with other property of like kind and quality.if,as in the case that was before the court,the repair option was chosen,the insurer liability was limited to the monetary amount necessary to repair the car function and appearance,commensurate with the condition of the auto prior to the loss.emphasis added.siegle,so d at.thus,in the court view,a promise to repair damaged property with like kind and quality meant that the insurer was obligated to restore the vehicle to its preloss condition.see also ray farmers insurance exchange,d,to the extent that plaintiff automobile was repaired to its safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition,defendant obligation under the policy of insurance to repair to like kind and quality was discharged emphasis added berry state farm mutual automobile insurance,under court interpretation of the texas insurance code,whether a part is of like kind and quality depends on the age or condition of the covered vehicle prior to the accident schwendeman usaa casualty insurance,under the insurance policy at issue,whether a replacement part is of like kind and quality to the part it replaces necessarily requires ascertaining the condition of the vehicle before the accident in terms of its age,mileage,and physical condition,and the quality of the replacement part snell geico,no.civ,slip op.at,wl.august,preloss condition of each individual vehicle must be established in order to determine whether insurer like kind and quality promise was breached.
state farm maintains that condition is what defines like kind and quality,rather than the other way around.for state farm it is irrelevant whether parts are of like kind and quality to oem parts.the determinative issue is whether the parts specified are sufficient to restore the vehicle to its preloss condition,the condition of the vehicle shortly before the accident.under this definition of like kind and quality,the specification of parts would not necessarily breach the like kind and quality promise.
we agree with state farm.the term like kind and quality,as used in the relevant policies,meant sufficient to restore a vehicle to its condition.we therefore conclude that the specification of parts would not necessarily constitute a breach of the like kind and quality promise.thus,we can not affirm the jury breach of contract verdict with respect to a subclass consisting of policyholders insured under this provision.
in sum,the jury breach of contract verdict may not be upheld for any subclass comprised of policyholders insured under any of the individual relevant policy forms.state farm specification of parts did not constitute a breach of the massachusetts policies or the assigned risk policies,neither of which expressly imposed any standard of part quality.nor did the specification of parts constitute a breach of the policies containing the condition and the you agree provisions.under the you agree language,the insured agrees that the condition promise may be met by specifying parts.further,the individualized proof needed to establish a breach of the condition promise would destroy the commonality required of a class action.finally,plaintiffs claim for breach of the like kind and quality promise fails for a number of reasons.first,the claim fails for lack of proof.in addition,state farm specification of parts did not constitute a breach of the policies containing the like kind and quality provision.the term like kind and quality,as used in the relevant policies,meant sufficient to restore a vehicle to its condition.this obligation,which is satisfied so long as the parts are sufficient to restore the vehicle to its preaccident condition,is not necessarily breached by the specification of parts.moreover,as noted above,the individualized proof required to establish a breach of the condition promise would overwhelm any questions common to the subclass,thus prohibiting certification of the claim as a class action.
there is an additional reason why the breach of contract verdict may not be upheld with regard to any subclass.plaintiffs have failed to establish damages.
specification damages 
two types of damages were awarded to the plaintiff class for breach of contract direct,or specification,damages,and consequential,or installation,damages.the first type of damages,which is based on plaintiffs theory that the contract was breached by the specification of parts,was calculated as the cost difference between the oem parts that plaintiffs claimed should have been specified and the parts that state farm listed on the repair estimate.according to plaintiffs,this figure constituted the amount that state farm saved by specifying cheaper parts.plaintiffs damages expert,iqbal mathur,calculated that specification damages for the class as a whole would total.under plaintiffs theory,everyone in the class was eligible to receive specification damages.
in our view,plaintiffs theory of specification damages has no basis in the law.under this theory,loss occurs when a part is specified on the estimate rather than when the part is installed on the vehicle.plaintiffs damages expert,mathur,conceded at trial that specification damages apply to any class member whose repair estimate specified a part,regardless of whether a part was used in the repair of the vehicle.thus,a policyholder who had been quoted a part on his estimate could receive specification damages even if his vehicle was repaired with an oem part,or his car was restored to its preloss condition.by this same reasoning,specification damages would apply where a part was specified on the estimate and was used in the repair,but the policyholder subsequently sold his vehicle for fair market value.if it is the simple specification of the part in a repair estimate that inflicts the damage,it is irrelevant,under plaintiffs theory,what happens afterwards,even if the policyholder ultimately suffers no actual damage.
it should be noted that,given this focus on the specification,rather than the installation,of parts,plaintiffs theory stands in contrast to their third amended complaint,as well as to the definition of the plaintiff class as certified by the circuit court.in their third amended complaint,plaintiffs describe state farm alleged breach of contract in terms of state farm use of parts in repairs that result,inter alia,in plaintiffs receipt of such parts 
defendant state farm common practice of using inferior,imitation parts in repairs constitutes a breach of its obligation to all insureds who either received such parts or were obligated to pay the difference in price between imitation parts and the oem parts actually installed.emphases added.
similarly,the circuit court,in defining the plaintiff class,refers to plaintiffs who had parts installed on their vehicles.in the judgment in favor of plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim,the plaintiff class was defined,in pertinent part,as 
all persons in the united states,except those residing in arkansas and tennessee,who,between july,and february,were insured by a vehicle casualty insurance policy issued by defendant state farm and made a claim for vehicle repairs pursuant to their policy and had authorized original equipment manufacturer crash parts installed on their vehicles or else received monetary compensation determined in relation to the cost of such parts.emphasis added.
given the contrast between the focus of the theory on the estimate listing of parts,on the one hand,and the references in the complaint and the class definition to the use or installation of parts,on the other,a question arises as to why plaintiffs devised their theory in the first instance.the answer lies in plaintiffs belated realization that they would be unable to establish damages and still maintain the commonality required of a class action.if,in keeping with the complaint and the class definition,loss did not occur until parts were installed,plaintiffs would need to show which class members vehicles had actually been repaired with parts,as well as which class members still owned vehicles that had been repaired with parts.however,state farm records did not contain this information accordingly,any determinations as to which plaintiffs were eligible for damages would require the examination of each individual class member vehicle and repair.such an undertaking,however,would mean that questions affecting individual class members would predominate over common questions,destroying the commonality required for a class action.see ilcs west magro continental toyota.
faced with this dilemma,plaintiffs created their theory,under which the alleged breach of contract and the resulting damages occurred when parts were specified in repair estimates,rather than when the parts were installed.if damage occurred when parts were specified,there would be no need for individual inquiry as to whether such parts were actually used in the repair of a particular vehicle,or whether the claimant still owned the vehicle in question.under plaintiffs theory,the damage occurred when the part was listed on the estimate,and it did not matter whether the part was actually used in the repair or whether the policyholder still owned the vehicle.
while plaintiffs specification damages theory appeared to preserve the commonality necessary for a class action,it achieved this goal at the expense of denoting real damages.common sense dictates that any injury resulting from parts would be inflicted,not by the mere specification of such parts in an estimate,but by the use of the parts in the repair of a vehicle.no possible damage could come to a policyholder simply because a part was listed on his repair estimate.only if the part were actually installed,and only if it were shown that this part failed to restore the vehicle to its preloss condition,could it possibly be said that the policyholder suffered damage.
indeed,plaintiffs own damages expert,mathur,acknowledged at trial that plaintiffs theory of specification damages made no economic sense.during,the following colloquy took place between state farm counsel and mathur 
so,from an economic perspective,which is all that you are qualified to testify about,you would have to tell us that your theory of direct damages does make economic sense is that true,sir 
a.that is correct.
thank you.so,according to you,as an economist,and not as a lawyer,using theories that plaintiffs lawyers have tried to give you,is a policyholder entitled to damages merely because state farm quoted a part on their estimate,as long as state farm did restore the car to its condition 
no.emphasis added.
we agree with plaintiffs damages expert that plaintiffs theory of specification damages makes no sense.in our view,plaintiffs notion of specification damages contravenes the basic theory of damages for breach of contract,under which the claimant must establish an actual loss or measurable damages resulting from the breach in order to recover.see,economy fire casualty gab business services,d.we reject,as a matter of law,plaintiffs theory of specification damages.
installation damages 
the second type of contract damages awarded was installation damages.unlike specification damages,installation damages were derived from a theory based on an actual loss.however,as explained below,the evidence offered in support of plaintiffs installation damages was so speculative and uncertain that awarding damages based on this evidence constituted an arbitrary deprivation of property in violation of state farm due process rights.see state farm mutual automobile insurance campbell,d,due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits imposition of arbitrary punishments.
installation damages consisted of the additional costs to be incurred by plaintiffs in removing parts from their vehicles and replacing them with oem parts.included in these damages was an amount to cover two days of car rental while the parts were being replaced.only those class members who actually had parts installed on their vehicles were eligible to receive installation damages.plaintiffs expert,mathur,explained that,for a variety of reasons,many plaintiffs who had parts specified on their repair estimates did not,in fact,have parts installed on their vehicles.these plaintiffs were not eligible for installation damages.thus,in order to calculate the amount of installation damages for the nationwide class,it was necessary to estimate the number of plaintiffs who were eligible for such damages.mathur estimated that,of the total number of plaintiffs who were quoted parts,the percentage whose vehicles were,in fact,repaired with parts ranged from to.in other words,although each class member estimate,by definition,specified parts,oem parts were actually installed on the class members cars as often as of the time.mathur testified that,in his view,the actual figure for repairs using parts probably was closer to than.he calculated that,if of class members received parts,installation damages for the class as a whole would total.if,on the other hand,the correct figure were,installation damages would total billion.
on,mathur acknowledged that,with regard to installation damages,it was necessary to determine whether a part had been installed on a class member vehicle.however,mathur conceded that he had no way of making this determination.mathur also acknowledged that he had no opinion as to how many class members had parts installed on their vehicles but later received fair market value for them.mathur admitted that his calculations as to installation damages might be incorrect by as much as billion.
the following exchange took place between counsel for state farm and mathur.
from an economic perspective,there is simply no way for you to identify which members of the class are entitled to damages is that right 
well,i do have the data,and so i really can not identify who the class members are.
therefore,there is no way for you to identify who is and who is not entitled to damages is that right,sir 
a.that is correct.
the jury awarded plaintiffs in installation damages.this was about billion less than mathur estimate.
while it has become acceptable to use statistical inference in determining aggregate damages in a class action suit,conte newberg,newberg on class actions,at ed,it also is understood that the possibility of error involved in such an approach may exceed constitutional bounds.see,bell farmers insurance exchange,th,d.in bell,for example,the court rejected a determination of aggregate damages,noting that the possible inaccuracy of the estimate of unpaid compensation presents an issue of constitutional dimension.bell.at,d at.see also in re chevron,cir a procedure is inherently unfair when the substantive rights of the defendant are resolved in a manner that lacks the requisite level of confidence in the reliability of its result.
in the case at bar,the range between mathur and estimates for installation damages was half a billion dollars.moreover,as previously indicated,mathur conceded that his estimates could be incorrect by as much as billion.a due process violation is clearly established where the method for determining damages has the potential to increase a defendant aggregate liability by as much as billion over what is warranted.see bell.at,d at hilao estate of marcos,cir.
notwithstanding the foregoing,the appellate court below concluded that there was little danger that ineligible class members will receive a share of this award installation damages.d at.in support of this view,the appellate court pointed,inter alia,to the size of the jury award,which was approximately billion less than the expert estimate.d at.unlike the appellate court,we find little comfort in the size of the jury award.in our view,it is troubling,rather than reassuring,that mathur range for installation damages was found by the jury to be too narrow,by another dollars.in other words,the jury had so little confidence in even the lowest estimate for installation damages that the jury found it necessary to reduce that figure by million.this suggests that the jury award of aggregate installation damages was based,not on mathur expert testimony,but on pure speculation and conjecture.
the potential for inaccuracy in mathur estimates is simply too great to support an award of damages.see bell,th at,d at.while expert testimony in support of damages awards may be couched in terms of probabilities or possibilities,there is a need for a reasonable degree of certainty in such testimony.see brown chicago north western transportation,d.here,given the fact that mathur conceded that the margin of error in his estimate of the amount of installation damages was a billion dollars,the requisite degree of reasonable certainty is lacking.in our view,there is no valid basis for upholding the award of installation damages for the nationwide class and,thus,no valid basis for awarding such damages with regard to a subclass.
in sum,the jury verdict on the breach of contract claim can not be affirmed.the jury was incorrectly instructed that the operative language in state farm various policy forms could be given a uniform interpretation.further,the verdict can not be affirmed for any subclass comprised of policyholders who were insured under any of the relevant individual policy forms.the reason is that plaintiffs claim for breach of contract fails on the merits.state farm specification of parts did not constitute a breach of any of the relevant individual policy forms,whether the policies at issue were those containing the like kind and quality promise,or those containing the condition and the you agree language,or whether the policies at issue were the massachusetts or assigned risk policies.moreover,plaintiffs have failed to establish contract damages.with regard to specification damages,there is no basis in the law for this theory.in addition,while the installation damages were derived from a model based on an actual loss,the evidence offered in support of them was too speculative and uncertain to support an award of damages.accordingly,we reverse the jury verdict that state farm breached its contractual obligations.in view of our disposition of plaintiffs contract claim,we need not reach state farm other arguments with regard to breach of contract.
one point raised by the dissent merits response.the dissent states that this court has ben t over backwards to rule in state farm favor at.at,at freeman,concurring in part and dissenting in part,joined by kilbride,that we have vilifi ed and humiliated plaintiffs counsel at.at,at,freeman,concurring in part and dissenting in part,joined by kilbride,and demeaned the courts below at.at,at freeman,concurring in part and dissenting in part,joined by kilbride,and that the result in this case has not been arrived at by an evenhanded application of the law,but because this court has developed a new hostility to class actions and wishes to send a message that different standards will be applied to cases arising out of the fifth district of our appellate court at.at,at freeman,concurring in part and dissenting in part,joined by kilbride,in other words,according to the dissent,this court decision to reverse the verdict on plaintiffs breach of contract count is the result of bias and extralegal considerations.this is emphatically not true.this appeal has been decided pursuant to the same standards that are applied to every case that is brought before this court.moreover,we have not fashioned any changes to the legal rules governing class actions,let alone ones that are hostile to this procedural device.in deciding plaintiffs breach of contract claim we have not acted with bias or favoritism but,instead,have applied the law objectively to the facts of record with no purpose other than to reach a just result.the dissent assertions to the contrary are unfounded and inappropriate.
ii.consumer fraud act 
state farm raises several arguments regarding the circuit court judgment that state farm violated the consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act consumer fraud act or act ilcs west.before addressing these arguments,we examine the factual background of plaintiffs consumer fraud count in detail.
this case did not begin as a consumer fraud action.as originally pled,plaintiffs class action complaint contained only a single count for breach of contract.plaintiffs added count ii,in which they alleged that state farm violated the consumer fraud act,in their second amended class action complaint a.
although their class action complaint was subsequently amended,the relevant portion of plaintiffs consumer fraud count remained unchanged.in their consumer fraud count,plaintiffs alleged the following 
among the unlawful practices that defendant engaged in was the practice of installing crash parts in its insureds vehicles that were inferior,substandard parts,when state farm had promised and was obligated to undertake repairs on damaged vehicles using only parts of like kind and quality,so as to restore the vehicles to their condition.
by way of false or deceptive pretenses,acts,or practices,defendant did not disclose to plaintiffs that they were a using inferior,imitation parts that diminished the value of their vehicles b paying the cost of cheaper imitation parts when available and refusing to pay for oem parts,thereby causing class members their repair shops to absorb the cost difference.
after plaintiffs added their consumer fraud count,state farm argued that it was simply a duplicate of the breach of contract count and,therefore,should be dismissed.state farm pointed in particular to the language in plaintiffs complaint which asserts that state farm violated the consumer fraud act by installing inferior parts despite having promised to use parts of like kind and quality.this language,according to state farm,was nothing more than a restatement by plaintiffs that state farm had breached a contractual promise.and,state farm argued,under decisions such as deleon beneficial construction,d,and petri gatlin,a breach of a contractual promise can not serve as the basis for a statutory consumer fraud action.
confronted with the argument that its consumer fraud count was simply a redressed version of its breach of contract count,plaintiffs retreated somewhat from the language in their complaint.during the hearing on state farm motion to decertify the class and motions for summary judgment,plaintiffs clarified to the circuit court that the consumer fraud count was not premised on the drafting,or the sale or even the interpretation of a contract.instead,according to plaintiffs,the consumer fraud count was based on actions,representations and omissions which occurred during the claims process,after the policyholder brought his or her car to an adjuster or body shop to receive an estimate and repair.this shift in emphasis was significant.by focusing on statements and actions which occurred during the claims process,rather than promises contained in the contract,plaintiffs were able to persuade the circuit court that the consumer fraud count was truly independent from the breach of contract count.thus,as the circuit court noted,the jury could say there a breach of contract,but that does necessarily mean there been consumer fraud.
in support of their argument that state farm made fraudulent representations and omissions during the claims process,plaintiffs relied on four documents.the first document was the estimate given to each of the named plaintiffs after his or her car had been examined by a state farm claims adjuster.each of these estimates consisted of a printout that listed the parts that were to be put on the plaintiff car,along with the prices of the parts.the estimates also give the source or type of each part.parts are listed as quality replacement parts,while oem parts are listed along with the manufacturer name.although the named plaintiffs estimates varied because of the individual nature of the repairs,each estimate used the term quality replacement part.thus,for example,on plaintiff sam defrank estimate,the part type for the various parts on the estimate is listed as quality replacement part,gm part or order from dealer.plaintiffs alleged that each member of the class,like defrank,received an estimate that included the term quality replacement part.a copy of defrank estimate is attached to this opinion as appendix 
stamped on defrank estimate in the upper corner of the first page are the words,read the attached information regarding quality replacement parts not made by the original equipment manufacturer.this statement refers to a document,known as a half sheet,which was attached to repair estimates that included parts.on the half sheet is a disclosure which states,in part,this estimate has been prepared based sic on the use of aftermarket crash parts supplied by a source other than the manufacturer of your motor vehicle.a copy of the half sheet is attached to this opinion as appendix 
the second item relied upon by plaintiffs was a brochure produced by state farm titled quality replacement parts.this brochure was allegedly given to each member of the consumer fraud class,usually at the time the insured received his or her estimate.in this brochure,state farm refers to parts as quality replacement parts and states that o nly those parts which meet our very high performance criteria are acceptable.also included in the brochure is a guarantee which states that if the policyholder is unsatisfied with the fit and corrosion resistance qualities of the replacement parts,then state farm will repair or replace the parts at no cost to the policyholder.a copy of the brochure is attached to this opinion as appendix 
unlike the estimates and the brochure,the third and fourth items identified by in a newsletter and a not given to the policyholders during the claims process.instead,these items were promotional or informational materials produced by state farm.plaintiffs used these materials to illustrate state farm marketing and use of the term quality replacement parts.
the newsletter which the plaintiffs relied upon is titled good neighbor news and is dated fall.the newsletter which is of record is in the form of a mailing and has a return address of a state farm agent based in michigan.the mailing address on the newsletter states generically,policyholder name policyholder address.a brief article discussing the high price of oem parts appears on the third page of the newsletter.in the middle of the article there is this quote high prices for parts is a major reason why it costs so much to repair a car that been damaged.and that why state farm is a big fan of what we call quality replacement parts.these parts are identical better original equipment manufacturers parts,but cost a lot less.
the fourth and final item identified by plaintiffs is an article from the april issue of a magazine called reflector,a state farm publication circulated to state farm agents.the article at issue,titled quality replacement parts,gives a general overview of state farm use of parts.underneath the title to the article appears this caption one of the bumpers on the cover of this reflector was produced by the original equipment manufacturer.the other is a quality replacement part produced by another company.the same is true of the other pairs of parts shown.the parts are identical except for one price.
as noted,the plaintiffs focus on the actions taken by state farm during the claims process made it possible for plaintiffs to pursue a separate count for consumer fraud.it also made possible a second important objective of certification.because the consumer fraud claim was based on the uniform representations contained in state farm written claims documents and not,for example,on the myriad different oral representations that occurred during the sales of the class members policies,plaintiffs were able to convince the circuit court that there was a common question of fact which predominated over the class.in its order certifying the nationwide consumer fraud class in language taken verbatim from plaintiffs filing in support of certification,the circuit court stressed the uniformity of the representations made during the claims process 
as to the consumer fraud allegations,the facts presented at the certification hearing on state farm methods of disclosing to policyholders its use of parts also demonstrates a course of conduct common to all class members.when such parts are used on an estimate,the policyholder is given a state farm brochure discussing the use of parts.defendant exhibit certification hearing at.the estimate is then stamped indicating the use of parts.defendant exhibit.state farm has also promoted the use of the term quality replacement parts nationwide in an effort to promote its substitution of for oem parts.plaintiffs exhibits and.
the court finds that the evidence introduced at the certification hearing demonstrate a series of essentially identical transactions,miner gillette company,at,at,between state farm and its insureds,which transactions routinely result in the use of parts.
in its certification order,the circuit court also determined that the consumer fraud act could,as a matter of statutory interpretation,be applied to members of the plaintiff class who did not reside in illinois.the court further concluded that applying the consumer fraud act to the entire class presented no or constitutional problems.in its subsequent order regarding law to be applied to class members claims,the circuit court explained its reasoning 
with respect to the claims under the illinois consumer fraud act,the court finds there are no true conflicts of law raised by the specific claims or facts at issue in this case which require application of the law of any state other than illinois.martin heinhold heinold commodities,ill d,and gordon boden,d,dist have approved the application of the illinois consumer fraud act to the claims of plaintiffs.state farm was chartered and is headquartered in illinois.state farm affirmatively uses and consents to the jurisdiction of illinois courts.it is alleged that the conduct at issue emanated from activities in illinois.given the aggregation of contacts of state farm with this jurisdiction,and the allegations that the conduct at issue emanated from activities in illinois,illinois possesses sufficient contacts so that the application of the illinois consumer fraud act to all class claims is neither unreasonable nor unfair and comports with due process.further,application of the illinois consumer fraud act to all claims will not interfere with any other jurisdictions legislative,regulatory or administrative policies.
based on its finding that a common fact predominated,and that the consumer fraud act could be applied to residents,the circuit court certified a nationwide class consisting of 
a ll persons in the united states,except those residing in arkansas and tennessee,who,between july,and february,were insured by a vehicle casualty insurance policy issued by defendant state farm and made a claim for vehicle repairs pursuant to their policy and had authorized crash parts installed on their vehicles or else received monetary compensation determined in relation to the cost of such parts.
at trial,the five named plaintiffs testified to the representations made and actions taken by state farm during each of their claims proceedings.each plaintiff stated that he or she had received a estimate,and all but one stated that they had received the quality replacement parts brochure.the point in the repair process at which the plaintiffs received the brochure,and whether they read it,varied from plaintiff to plaintiff.shadle,for example,testified that he received his estimate and quality replacement parts brochure when the claims adjuster first looked at his car,but that he did not read the brochure.avery stated that he received his estimate and brochure in the mail after taking his car to an adjuster,that he read the brochure,and that he was extremely concerned about what it said.vickers first saw her written estimate when she went to pick up her car after it was repaired,although her body shop told her early in the repair process that parts were going to be used.she did not say whether she received or read the brochure.like vickers,covington did not see his estimate prior to the repairs being started,although his body shop informed him that parts were being used.covington received and read his brochure after the repairs were finished.defrank testified that he received his estimate and brochure from the claims adjuster prior to the repair of his pickup truck.he read the brochure and became very upset.notably,none of the five plaintiffs testified that they saw,read or were aware of the articles in the good neighbor news newsletter or the reflector magazine.
at the conclusion of trial,the circuit court found that state farm had violated the consumer fraud act with respect to the five named plaintiffs and the class as a whole.in its judgment order,the circuit court noted that a violation of the consumer fraud act could not be proven simply by showing a breach of a contractual promise 
the court,after considering all the evidence,finds,as did the jury,that state farm did breach its contract with the plaintiffs,that the crash parts specified and used by state farm were not of like kind and quality and did not restore plaintiffs vehicles to their condition as required by the insurance contract between state farm and the plaintiffs.these findings do not on their own establish a violation of the act.the court must now consider whether the evidence also establishes the elements,set forth above,which are required to prove a violation of the consumer fraud act.
after stating the above,the circuit court set forth what it concluded were the deceptive acts perpetrated by state farm.the circuit court stated 
the plaintiffs allege,under count ii and count iii of the third amended class action complaint,that state farm violated the consumer fraud act.the plaintiffs allegations include,without limitation,that state farm installed inferior crash parts on the plaintiffs vehicles when it was obligated under its insurance policies with the plaintiffs to use crash parts of like kind and quality which would restore plaintiffs vehicles to their condition and that state farm failed to disclose to plaintiffs that it was using and paying for cheaper,inferior crash parts to repair plaintiffs vehicles.
after considering all the testimony and evidence admitted at trial,the court finds that the plaintiffs have proven that state farm violated the consumer fraud act and that none of the defenses asserted by state farm bar plaintiffs right to recover under the act or reduce the amount of plaintiffs recovery.
state farm,prior to and during the class period for the consumer fraud act plaintiffs,knew that the crash parts it was specifying on its policyholders repair estimates were not of like kind and quality and would not restore their policyholders vehicles to condition.state farm knowledge of the inferiority of the crash parts is clearly shown sic the testimony of witnesses,state farm own internal documents,capa documents state farm was instrumental in the creation of capa.capa stated purpose was to certify quality crash parts and state farm officers and management served on capa board prior to and during the class period for consumer fraud act plaintiffs of which state farm had knowledge,and other documents,all of which were admitted into evidence and appear in the trial court record.rather than telling its policyholders of the known problems with the crash parts,including possible safety concerns,state farm chose to adopt and use on its estimates the misleading term quality replacement parts,and to tell its policyholders,in various written documents which were admitted into evidence,that the parts were as good,or better than,oem parts.further,the written disclosures stamped on or attached to the repair estimates or which were delivered with the repair estimates,did nothing to advise the state farm policyholder of the inferiority of the parts.finally,state farm guarantee improperly and unfairly placed the burden of securing a quality repair on the policyholder,not state farm.
state farm is a mutual insurance company which operates for the benefit of its policyholders.state farm occupies a position of trust with its policyholders,who pay the required premiums and are entitled to receive all the benefits state farm promises to provide in its insurance contract with them.state farm violated this trust.the court finds that state farm,in light of its knowledge of the inferiority of crash parts,misrepresented,concealed,suppressed or omitted material facts concerning the crash parts,with the intent that its policyholders rely upon on sic these deceptions,in violation of the consumer fraud act.
in succinct fashion,the circuit court also held that state farm deceptive acts had proximately caused the named plaintiffs and the class as a whole actual damages and that the actual damages were defined in the same terms as they were under the breach of contract count 
the court further finds that as a direct and proximate result of state farm violation of the consumer fraud act,the plaintiffs were injured and incurred actual damages namely the damages and installation damages which occurred during the class period for consumer fraud act plaintiffs.
because the consumer fraud damages were identical to the breach of contract damages,the circuit court reasoned that an award of actual damages for consumer fraud would constitute a double recovery.the circuit court therefore declined to award plaintiffs actual economic damages ilcs a west under the consumer fraud act.the circuit court did,however,award plaintiffs million in disgorgement damages and million in punitive damages.
on appeal,the appellate court affirmed the circuit court certification of a nationwide class for consumer fraud.as in the circuit court,the appellate court held that a common question of fact predominated for the class based upon state farm uniform practice of specifying parts and providing its insureds with a written estimate and a quality replacement parts brochure 
in regard to the claim,the record contained evidence that state farm engaged in an ongoing course of conduct nationwide,in which it specified inferior parts whenever those parts were cheaper and available,that state farm knew those parts were inferior,that state farm did not inform its policyholders of the problems with those parts,and that state farm affirmatively misrepresented the condition of those parts by assuring the damage estimates and in it specified only quality replacement parts and that it guaranteed the parts at no additional cost.d at.
like the circuit court,the appellate court also held that the consumer fraud act could be applied to consumers residing.citing martin heinold commodities,the appellate court determined that consumers are permitted to pursue an action under the act against a resident defendant where the deceptive acts and practices are perpetrated in illinois.d at.the appellate court then concluded the evidence demonstrates that the deceptive claims practices occurred in illinois.it was in illinois that the claims practices were devised and procedures for implementation were prepared for dissemination in other states.d at.finally,the appellate court affirmed the circuit court finding that there were no true conflicts between the consumer fraud act and other states consumer fraud laws and that illinois has significant contacts to the claims asserted by each class member.d at.from this,the appellate court concluded that there was no constitutional barrier to applying the consumer fraud act to the claims of plaintiffs who resided.d at.
with respect to the merits of the claim,state farm repeated its argument to the appellate court that plaintiffs consumer fraud claim was nothing more than a restatement of the breach of contract claim.citing to several decisions from the appellate court in support of this argument,including zankle queen anne landscaping,d,state farm argued that the trial court finding of liability under the consumer fraud act should be reversed.the appellate court rejected this contention,finding that t he evidence of state farm deceptive claims practices moves this case beyond a mere contract breach.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule.
state farm also argued to the appellate court that it was not liable under the consumer fraud act for the affirmative representations it made to plaintiffs because those representations were merely puffing and,therefore,not actionable.the appellate court rejected this argument,stating 
in our view,state farm representations assigned virtues to parts that they did not possess.see totz continental du page acura,d,rumford countrywide funding,d.they are representations that a reasonable policyholder would have interpreted as fact.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule.
finally,state farm argued to the appellate court that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the actions,representations or omissions which occurred during the claims process proximately caused injury to any of the class members.the appellate court rejected this argument too 
plaintiffs presented evidence that the parts which state farm specified were categorically inferior,that state farm specified parts that it knew to be inferior,that state farm did not inform its policyholders that the parts it specified were inferior,and that state farm knowingly represented on its estimates,in its quality replacement part s brochures,and through its estimators that these parts were of equal quality or better than oem parts.there is evidence that state farm material misrepresentations led numerous class members to blindly accept the parts specified,without knowledge of the inferior condition of those parts.see perona volkswagen of america,d at,johnston anchor organization for health maintenance,d.there is overwhelming evidence of state farm calculated deception of its policyholders in a deliberate disregard of its express written promises contained in the policies issued.the deceit was deliberate and universally employed for the purpose of obtaining unearned,illegitimate monetary gain.this was an gain,acquired at the expense of persons that trusted and relied upon state farm for honest,fair treatment.there is an abundance of evidence to support the trial court finding that the class members injuries were proximately caused by state farm deceptive conduct.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule.
based on this reasoning,the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court holding that state farm had violated the consumer fraud act.the appellate court also affirmed the circuit court million punitive damage award.however,the appellate court reversed the million in disgorgement damages,holding that it constituted an impermissible double recovery.state farm then appealed.
on appeal,state farm contests the circuit court certification of a nationwide consumer fraud class,as well as the circuit court judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the merits.we first examine,however,the nature of plaintiffs consumer fraud claim.
plaintiffs consumer fraud claim 
surprisingly,although plaintiffs allegation of consumer fraud has been in litigation for several years,and a statutory consumer fraud claim must be pled with specificity connick suzuki motor,there is still some evinced by plaintiffs arguments before this to exactly what conduct of state farm is at issue under the consumer fraud claim.to clarify what is at issue,it will be helpful to identify that conduct which we can readily conclude does not support plaintiffs consumer fraud claim.
plaintiffs consumer fraud claim may not be based on a breach of a promise contained in their insurance policies 
before the circuit court,plaintiffs maintained that their consumer fraud count was not based on the drafting,or the sale or even the interpretation of any class member insurance policy.yet in their brief before this court,plaintiffs repeatedly point to state farm contractual promises to define the consumer fraud.plaintiffs state,for example,that state farm disregarded the express written promises in its policies,that there was no evidence that plaintiffs or the class knew,expected or understood that state farm would specify parts that failed to fulfill its contractual obligations,and that t he law implies and recognizes the expectation,understanding and belief that state farm would fulfill its contractual obligation.similarly,although both the circuit court and the appellate court stated that plaintiffs consumer fraud count was not based on a breach of a contractual promise,each court referenced state farm failure to fulfill its policy obligations in its analysis of plaintiffs consumer fraud claim.the appellate court in particular,in upholding the circuit court consumer fraud judgment,pointedly relied on state farm deliberate disregard of its express written promises contained in the policies issued.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule.these repeated references to simple breaches of contractual promises in support of the consumer fraud count are in error.
a breach of contractual promise,without more,is not actionable under the consumer fraud act.american airlines,wolens,d,quoting golembiewski hallberg insurance agency,d.as our appellate court has explained 
what plaintiff calls consumer fraud or deception is simply defendants failure to fulfill their contractual obligations.were our courts to accept plaintiff assertion that promises that go unfulfilled are actionable under the consumer fraud act,consumer plaintiffs could convert any suit for breach of contract into a consumer fraud action.however,it is settled that the consumer fraud act was not intended to apply to every contract dispute or to supplement every breach of contract claim with a redundant remedy.see law offices of william stogsdill cragin federal bank for savings,d,golembiewski hallberg insurance agency,d.we believe that a deceptive act or practice involves more than the mere fact that a defendant promised something and then failed to do it.that type of misrepresentation occurs every time a defendant breaches a contract.zankle queen anne landscaping,d.
accord,kleczek jorgensen,d,lake county grading of libertyville,advance mechanical contractors,d,exchange national bank farm bureau life insurance of michigan,d,deleon beneficial construction,d,petri gatlin.
both the circuit court and appellate court recognized this principle but both courts failed to apply it consistently.as a matter of law,plaintiffs consumer fraud claim may not be based on the assertion that state farm breached its promise to restore plaintiffs vehicles to their condition or that state farm breached its promise to repair plaintiffs vehicles using parts of like kind and quality.
this case is not about the specification of defective parts 
before this court,plaintiffs do not claim to have proven that any of the parts specified by state farm in its repair estimates were defective.this is in keeping with plaintiffs position at trial.plaintiffs deliberately avoided any theory relating to defective parts at trial because such a theory would have significantly increased their burden of proof.such a theory would also have rendered class certification far less likely,since the common question of fact or law necessary for certification would have been more difficult to establish if plaintiffs had been forced to prove that each individual part,or grouping of parts,was defective.thus,before the circuit court,plaintiffs counsel made it very clear that they were not trying to prove that any of the parts at issue were defective,at one point saying a s we stated this is not a defect case.we are not proving and we are not required to prove that the parts are defective.
what plaintiffs do claim to have established at trial is a proposition far more general than whether any of the specified parts were defective.plaintiffs claim to have proven that parts,as a whole,are not as good as oem parts.or,to use plaintiffs terminology,that parts are categorically inferior to oem parts.but categorically inferior is not the same thing as categorically defective.this point is important.
in their written opinions,both the circuit court and the appellate court refer to state farm specification of categorically inferior parts as if the act of specifying nondefective parts,by itself,is fraudulent.the appellate court,for example,in describing state farm allegedly deceptive acts,notes that p laintiffs presented evidence that the parts which state farm specified were categorically inferior,and that state farm specified parts that it knew to be inferior.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule.however,it is no more and of specify parts while knowing that they are not as good as oem parts than it is to sell chevrolet automobiles while knowing that they are not as good as cadillacs.whether the consumer product is automobiles,toasters or something else,there will always be some brands of that product that are not as good as,or which are categorically inferior to,other brands of the same product.the state economy would come to a grinding halt if the sale of anything less than the single,best brand of every consumer good were considered fraudulent.
what makes the specification of the nondefective,part potentially fraudulent are the statements which are made,or not made,about the product.it is the omissions and representations state farm made about simply the act of specifying must form the basis of plaintiffs consumer fraud action.
the representations which form the basis of plaintiffs cause of action for consumer fraud do not include the statement that parts are as good as oem parts 
the appellate court based its holding that state farm violated the consumer fraud act,in part,on its findings that state farm knowingly represented on its estimates and in its quality replacement parts brochures that parts were of equal quality or better than oem parts.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule.these findings,however,are incorrect.neither the written estimates nor the quality replacement parts brochures which the named plaintiffs received from state farm contain the statement that parts are of equal quality to or better than oem parts.see appendix a and appendix 
as previously noted,two of the state farm documents relied upon by plaintiffs in this case,the good neighbor news newsletter and the reflector magazine,do contain the statement that parts are as good as,or better than,oem parts.however,there is no evidence that any of the named plaintiffs ever read,saw or were in any way aware of these documents.this is not surprising.the good neighbor news newsletter which is of record is dated fall,one year before the starting date of the consumer fraud class period and approximately three years before the earliest of the five named plaintiffs accidents occurred.the reflector magazine article was circulated to state farm agents,not policyholders,and was published in,some six years before the earliest of the named plaintiffs accidents and four years before the starting date of the class period.
in its order certifying the nationwide consumer fraud class,the circuit court wrote that state farm has also promoted the use of the term quality replacement parts nationwide in an effort to promote its substitution of for oem parts.this sentence seems to suggest that the circuit court found the newsletter and magazine articles relevant to all policyholders,regardless of whether they saw them or not,because the articles helped create a nationwide market for parts.however,we explicitly rejected this market theory of causation in oliveira amoco oil,and again,more recently,in shannon boise cascade.accordingly,neither the good neighbor news newsletter nor the reflector magazine has any relevance to this case,and the statement that parts are of equal quality to or better than oem parts simply does not support plaintiffs consumer fraud claim.
describing a part as a quality replacement part is puffing and,hence,not actionable 
plaintiffs object to two phrases describing parts which appear in the named plaintiffs estimates and in the quality replacement parts brochure.the first phrase plaintiffs point to is quality replacement parts.this phrase appears in both the named plaintiffs estimates,as a line entry under part type see,appendix a,and in the brochure received along with the estimate see appendix c.the second phrase is very high performance criteria,which appears in the brochure in this sentence only those parts which meet our very high performance criteria are acceptable.see appendix plaintiffs maintain that both these phrases are deceptive under the consumer fraud act.
state farm,however,contends that these phrases are merely puffing and,hence,can not form a basis for plaintiffs consumer fraud claim.we agree.puffing denotes the exaggerations reasonably to be expected of a seller as to the degree of quality of his or her product,the truth or falsity of which can not be precisely determined.see,speakers of sport,proserv,cir puffing in the usual sense signifies meaningless superlatives that no reasonable person would take seriously,and so it is not actionable as fraud.such statements include subjective descriptions relating to quality.see,evanston hospital crane,d,breckenridge cambridge homes,d,expert workmanship,custom quality,perfect zimmerman northfield real estate,d,magnificent,comfortable spiegel sharp electronics,d,picture perfect see also state american tv appliance of madison,a general statement that one products are best is not actionable as a misrepresentation of fact.describing a product as quality or as having high performance criteria are the types of subjective characterizations that illinois courts have repeatedly held to be mere puffing.thus,as a matter of law,neither phrase can be considered deceptive under the consumer fraud act.
plaintiffs nevertheless point out that the circuit court found that the phrase quality replacement parts was misleading.however,the circuit court did not cite to,or distinguish,any of the decisions cited above which hold that subjective statements of quality are merely puffing.moreover,the circuit court did not cite any evidence to support its finding that the phrase was misleading and never made any determination that the phrase quality replacement parts stated a deceptive fact.
the appellate court,unlike the circuit court,did conclude that state farm made representations that a reasonable policyholder would have interpreted as fact.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule.the appellate court determined that state farm representations assigned virtues to parts that they did not possess and,therefore,the representations violated the act.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule.however,the appellate court conclusion that state farm representations assigned virtues to parts that they did not possess is based on a misstatement of the facts.the appellate court found that state farm represented on its estimates and in its quality replacement part s brochures that parts were of equal quality or better than oem parts.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule.as noted,this is incorrect.the statement that parts are as good as oem parts does not appear in either the named plaintiffs estimates or the quality replacement parts brochure.
there is no basis for concluding,as plaintiffs contend,that the phrases quality replacement parts and high performance criteria are anything other than puffing.thus,these phrases can not support plaintiffs consumer fraud claim.
the guarantee provided by state farm can not form a basis for plaintiffs consumer fraud claim 
the circuit court held that state farm violated the consumer fraud act by providing a guarantee which states that if the policyholder is unsatisfied with the fit and corrosion resistance qualities of a replacement part,then state farm will repair or replace the part at no cost.the circuit court concluded that this guarantee violated the act because it improperly and unfairly placed the burden of securing a quality repair on the policyholder,not state farm.plaintiffs point to this conclusion in support of their contention that state farm violated the act.
it is not clear what the circuit court meant when it held that state farm guarantee improperly put a burden on policyholders.every guarantee places a burden on the manufacturer or retailer must be notified when there is a problem with the product that is produced or sold and the guarantee must be invoked.for this reason,the circuit court can not be correct if it meant that the guarantee is fraudulent because it required the policyholders to take action.if this were true,every guarantee,no matter how comprehensive or generous,would be inherently fraudulent.
plaintiffs argue,however,that the guarantee put an improper burden on policyholders because it was simply too difficult to use.according to plaintiffs,state farm adjustors would brush off attempts to use the guarantee,getting an oem replacement part once the guarantee was invoked could take up to three to five days,and e ven when a body shop showed state farm that a crash part did not fit,state farm would still sometimes not authorize oem parts.however,several witnesses,including some who testified on behalf of plaintiffs,stated that the guarantee was honored in a routine fashion.for example,plaintiffs witness dave beyers,the manager of a body shop in williamson county,testified that if he had a problem with a fender he would simply fax up a form to state farm and p ut the oem fender on.
more important,none of the named plaintiffs in this case testified that they had problems using the guarantee.indeed,none of the named plaintiffs made any attempt to invoke it.avery and shadle refused to have parts put on their vehicles,so for them,the guarantee was not at issue.the other named plaintiffs,covington,defrank and vickers,did not attempt to use the guarantee.defrank was specifically asked whether he took advantage of state farm guarantee that had been provided to him at the time the estimate was prepared.he answered that he had not.accordingly,there is no basis in the record for concluding that the guarantee was unduly burdensome for the named plaintiffs,let alone for the class members as a whole.
finally,plaintiffs point out that when a policyholder successfully used the guarantee,the amount paid to replace the part was recorded as an indemnity payment and became part of the insured claim file.plaintiffs speculate that the inclusion of this information in the claim file could possibly rais e the insured rates.however,plaintiffs point to no testimony or other evidence of record to support this assertion.thus,we conclude that the guarantee offered by state farm can not form a basis for plaintiffs consumer fraud claim.
the crux of plaintiffs consumer fraud claim is a failure by state farm to disclose the categorical inferiority of parts during the claims process 
having eliminated that conduct which clearly can not support a claim for consumer fraud,what remains is the core allegation stated in plaintiffs complaint by way of false or deceptive pretenses,acts,or practices,defendant did not disclose to plaintiffs that they were a using inferior,imitation parts.
plaintiffs complaint does not allege that state farm failed to disclose an inferior characteristic of any specific part.this is to be expected,since the characteristics of one part were not always present in every other part and did not always apply to every member of the class.for example,while plaintiffs contended at trial that some parts were not as safe as oem parts a proposition which state farm vigorously disputed,this contention applied only to some of the parts at issue,such as bumpers,which not every member of the class received.similarly,plaintiffs assertion that some parts were inferior because they were not properly galvanized applied only to metal parts,not plastic.thus,the allegedly deceptive act which was common to the entire class and every repair was not the failure to disclose a specific inferior characteristic but,rather,the failure to disclose the supposed categorical inferiority of parts.this failure to disclose,according to plaintiffs,constitutes the concealment,suppression or omission of any material fact ilcs west in violation of the act.
further,the failure to disclose occurred during the claims process.recall that state farm practice of giving its policyholders a written estimate and a which the alleged categorical inferiority of parts was not precisely the basis on which the circuit court found,in its order certifying the consumer fraud class,that state farm conduct was common to all class members.as the circuit court stated 
as to the consumer fraud allegations,the facts presented at the certification hearing on state farm methods of disclosing to policyholders its use of parts also demonstrates a course of conduct common to all class members.when such parts are used on an estimate,the policyholder is given a state farm brochure discussing the use of parts.defendant exhibit certification hearing at.the estimate is then stamped indicating the use of parts.defendant exhibit.
the appellate court below correctly stated the core allegation of plaintiffs consumer fraud claim plaintiffs claimed that by adopting and employing this claims practice,state farm deceived its policyholders in that it failed to inform them of the inferior quality of specified replacement parts.d at.it is this allegation we must keep in mind when considering the remaining challenges raised by state farm in this appeal.
propriety of the nationwide consumer fraud class 
state farm contends that the circuit court certification of a nationwide consumer fraud class was improper.according to state farm,the circuit court application of the consumer fraud act to policyholders across the country was impermissible because the act,by its own terms,does not apply to consumer transactions involving nonresidents that occur outside illinois.moreover,in state farm view,the certification of the nationwide class violated illinois rules,as well as the full faith and credit clause,the due process clause,and the commerce clause of the federal constitution.a determination by this court that the consumer fraud act does not apply,by its own terms,to the transactions at issue in this case would render it unnecessary to address state farm and constitutional arguments.accordingly,we consider the scope of the consumer fraud act first.see,beahringer page,holding that constitutional questions will not be decided if case can be decided on other grounds.because the scope of the act is a question of statutory interpretation,our review is de novo.lucas lakin.
scope of the consumer fraud act 
section of the consumer fraud act provides that deceptive acts or practices or the concealment,suppression or omission of any material fact,with intent that others rely upon the concealment,suppression or omission of such material fact in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.ilcs west.section a of the act authorizes private causes of action for practices proscribed by section.section a states,in pertinent part any person who suffers actual damage as a result of a violation of the act committed by any other person may bring an action against such person.ilcs a west.to prove a private cause of action under section a of the act,a plaintiff must establish a deceptive act or practice by the defendant,the defendant intent that the plaintiff rely on the deception,the occurrence of the deception in the course of conduct involving trade or commerce,and actual damage to the plaintiff proximately caused by the deception.oliveira,at.
as noted,state farm maintains that a nonresident consumer may not pursue a private cause of action under the act when the disputed consumer transaction occurs.plaintiffs dispute this contention.to support their positions,both plaintiffs and state farm note that a plaintiff can not recover under the act unless the defendant disputed conduct involves trade or commerce.ilcs west oliveira,at.both parties then point to section f of the act,the provision of the act which defines the terms trade and commerce 
f the terms trade and commerce mean the advertising,offering for sale,sale,or distribution of any services and any property,tangible or intangible,real,personal or mixed,and any other article,commodity,or thing of value wherever situated,and shall include any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this state.ilcs f west.
plaintiffs initially state that section f expressly notes that it applies to transactions wherever situated.this is incorrect.the words wherever situated do not refer to fraudulent transactions,but to the nouns any property,tangible or intangible,real,personal or mixed,and any other article,commodity,or thing of value.ilcs f west.the words wherever situated do not expand the scope of the act to apply to consumer transactions that take place.
state farm,in its argument,points to the language of section f,which states that the trade or commerce must affect the people of this state.ilcs f west.emphasizing the words this state,state farm contends that the act is limited to transactions which take place in illinois.further,according to state farm,the consumer fraud act does not provide a cause of action to nonresidents whose claims processes took place outside of illinois because those transactions had no effect on the people of illinois.plaintiffs,in reply,argue that the language of section f is broadly worded,and emphasize that the trade or commerce need only indirectly affect ilcs f west the people of illinois.from this,plaintiffs maintain that there is no geographic limit to the trade or commerce covered by the act.
the language of section f has been interpreted by courts in a variety of ways.this divergence of interpretation is most notable in the federal district courts.in one of the earliest opinions to address the statute,seaboard seed bemis,the district court concluded that section f defines trade and commerce in a geographically limited manner.see also bettarini citicorp services,c,wl noting the geographical scope of the act and rejecting a claim under the act where the defendant complained of conduct impacted on plaintiff only at his home base in london swartz schaub.other district courts,however,have expressly disagreed with the notion that the act is limited geographically.see nichols motorcycle supply dunlop tire,this court believes that the illinois consumer fraud act,although intended to protect illinois consumers,does not contain a geographic limitation see also continental xre,c,wl same.
still other district courts interpreting section f have concluded that the section limits the scope of the act based on the residency of the plaintiff.some of the courts adopting this focus have concluded that the act is intended only to protect and benefit illinois residents.lincoln national life insurance silver,c,cited in nichols.at.other courts,however,have concluded that nonresidents may pursue a cause of action,although these courts typically hold that the transaction at issue must occur in illinois or that there be an adequate connection to illinois.see,tylka gerber products,noting that c ourts in this district are split as to whether the consumer fraud act may apply to consumers who are not citizens of illinois and holding that the act could apply where the transactions giving rise to the action took place in illinois man roland,quantum color,d,rejecting interpretation of the act which extends standing only to consumers who are illinois residents and holding that the act could apply where the nonresident consumer purchased a product in illinois from an illinois corporation rohlfing manor care,even under those cases allowing nonresidents to pursue a cause of action under the act,the residents in this case could not do so because their claims had little or no connection to illinois peters northern trust,c,wl noting split in the district courts based on residency and holding that plaintiffs consumer fraud claim failed because the conduct underlying the claims had no connection to illinois.
additional interpretations of section f also exist in the district courts.one court has stated that what is important in determining whether a plaintiff may pursue a cause of action under section f is not the plaintiff residency,but the state of illinois interest in protecting its consumers ivanhoe financial,mortgage essentials,c,wl,while another court has referred to section f as imposing illinois contact requirements uniroyal goodrich tire mutual trading.still other permutations can be found in the district courts this list is not exhaustive.
like the federal district courts,our appellate court has also divided over the question of how best to interpret section f.in oliveira amoco oil,d,vacated in part rev on other grounds,the fourth district of our appellate court declined to hold that the act applied to consumers.oliveira,d at,citing scott association for childbirth at home,international.the appellate court decision in oliveira was subsequently cited by a first district decision in prime leasing,kendig,d,where the court stated in dicta that the act normally does not apply to consumers.prime leasing,d at.
in the case at bar,the fifth district concluded,without discussing the statutory language of section f or any of the federal district court decisions discussing this issue,that consumers are permitted to pursue an action under the act against a resident defendant where the deceptive acts and practices are perpetrated in illinois.d at.more recently,in bunting progressive,d,the first district elected to follow the appellate court decision in this case and rejected the defendant argument that the act is inapplicable because plaintiff is a nonresident.bunting,d at.
it is not clear from the plain language of section f which,if any,of the many interpretations noted above accurately captures the meaning of that provision.indeed,the wealth of competing interpretations of section f is a compelling indication of the statute ambiguity.see,krohe city of bloomington,a statute is ambiguous if it is capable of being understood by reasonably persons in two or more different ways.because the language of section f is ambiguous,it is appropriate for us to consider other sources,including legislative history,in order to discern the statute meaning.see,people jameson.
although there is not a great deal of legislative history with respect to section f,we do find relevant a statement from senator sours,the senate sponsor of the bill which created a private cause of action under the act and which added section f.see pub.act,eff.september.just before the vote in the senate was taken,senator sours made the following remarks 
just to conclude briefly president and senators,i like to just read a couple of excerpts from this bill and the excerpts are very brief to indicate the broad terms of the bill.i reading line on page the terms trade and commerce and that really is what we talking about.we talking about trade and commerce that is not included within the interstate concept.means the advertising and how much of that we see offering for sale,sale or distribution of any services and any property tangible or and intangible,real,personal or mixed and every other article,commodity or thing of value wherever it situated and shall include any trade or commerce,directly or indirectly affecting the people of this state.emphasis added,senate proceedings,june,at statements of senator sours.
in addition to senator sours statement,we note the rule of construction in illinois which holds that a statute is without extraterritorial effect unless a clear intent in this respect appears from the express provisions of the statute.industrial comm n,graham general grant post,see also sale haitian centers council,d,acts of congress normally do not have extraterritorial application unless such an intent is clearly manifested d statutes.given the statement of senator sours and the rule against giving statutes extraterritorial effect unless an intent to do so is clearly expressed,we conclude that the general assembly did not intend the consumer fraud act to apply to fraudulent transactions which take place outside illinois.
having concluded that the act does not have extraterritorial effect,the next step in our analysis is to determine whether the transactions at issue in this case took place outside illinois.we first observe,however,that it can be difficult to identify the situs of a consumer transaction when,as plaintiffs in this case allege,the transaction is made up of components that occur in more than one state.to solve this problem,courts have often directed their focus to the site of injury or reason being that,until a deceptive statement has been communicated to a plaintiff and there has been an injury,there is no fraudulent transaction and no cause of action.the court of appeals of new york followed this approach in goshen mutual life insurance.in that decision,the new york court considered whether hatching a scheme or originating a marketing campaign in new york constituted an actionable deceptive act under a consumer fraud statute which limited the definition of trade or commerce to that which occurred.goshen,at,at.the court concluded that it did not.the court explained that t he origin of any advertising or promotional conduct is irrelevant if the deception is,the advertisement or promotional not result in a transaction in which the consumer was harmed.goshen,at,at.because there was no fraudulent transaction until the deception occurred,the location of the deception was the controlling factor.thus,the court held that to qualify as a prohibited act under the statute,the deception of a consumer must occur in new york.goshen,at,at.see also graham general grant post,no cause of action under illinois dram shop act where the injury to plaintiff occurred.
the position taken by the goshen court is not unreasonable.in a misrepresentation case,there is no fraudulent transaction until the misrepresentation has been communicated.but the goshen court view of the situs of a consumer transaction is a narrow one.the place of injury or deception is only one of the circumstances that make up a fraudulent transaction and focusing solely on that fact can create questionable results.if,for example,the bulk of the circumstances that make up a fraudulent transaction occur within illinois,and the only thing that occurs is the injury or deception,it seems to make little sense to say that the fraudulent transaction has occurred outside illinois.stated otherwise,we believe that there is a broader alternative to the position taken by the goshen court,namely,that a fraudulent transaction may be said to take place within a state if the circumstances relating to the transaction occur primarily and substantially within that state.
the general assembly has stated that the consumer fraud act shall be liberally construed to effect its purposes.ilcs west.given this fact,we believe that the general assembly intended the broader understanding of an transaction noted above.accordingly,we hold that a plaintiff may pursue a private cause of action under the consumer fraud act if the circumstances that relate to the disputed transaction occur primarily and substantially in illinois.in adopting this holding,we recognize that there is no single formula or test for determining whether a transaction occurs within this state.rather,each case must be decided on its own facts.accordingly,the critical question in this case becomes whether the circumstances relating to plaintiffs disputed transactions with state farm occurred primarily and substantially in illinois.
whether the consumer fraud act applies to the transactions at issue in this case 
the appellate court below concluded that the consumer fraud act could be applied to the plaintiffs in this case.the appellate court explained the evidence demonstrates that the deceptive claims practices occurred in illinois.it was in illinois that the claims practices were devised and procedures for implementation were prepared for dissemination in other states.d at.
we agree with the appellate court that the place where a company policy is created or where a form document is drafted may be a relevant factor to consider in determining the location of a consumer transaction.however,in this case,it does not follow that because a single factor relating to state farm claims practices with its policyholders took place in illinois,the claims practice itself occurred in illinois.in fact,just the opposite is true.the overwhelming majority of circumstances relating to the disputed transactions in this farm claims outside of illinois for the plaintiffs.
plaintiff michael avery transaction with state farm during the claims process is representative of the situation of the plaintiffs.avery resides in louisiana,not illinois.his car was garaged in louisiana and his accident occurred there as well.avery estimate was written in louisiana and he received his quality replacement parts brochure in louisiana.the alleged deception in this failure to disclose the inferiority of occurred in louisiana.the repair of avery car took place in louisiana.damage to avery,if any,occurred in louisiana.moreover,there is no evidence that avery ever met or talked to a state farm employee who works in illinois.avery contact with state farm was through a louisiana agent,a louisiana claims representative,and a louisiana adjustor.in sum,the overwhelming majority of the circumstances which relate to avery and the other plaintiffs claims disputed transactions in this outside illinois.we conclude,therefore,that the plaintiffs in this case have no cognizable cause of action under the consumer fraud act.
in support of the appellate court,plaintiffs rely on martin heinold commodities,martin i,to which the appellate court cited.in martin i,a plaintiff class consisting of both illinois and residents brought suit against an illinois company that had served as broker for the plaintiffs in commodities transactions.the broker relationship had been established by a contract that allegedly contained deceptive statements.this court allowed certification of the plaintiffs claims under the illinois consumer fraud act,even with respect to the plaintiffs.martin i,at.
martin i is of little help to plaintiffs.in addressing the propriety of the class before it,martin i considered only whether the class comported with the due process principles laid out in phillips petroleum shutts,d.martin i,at.martin i did not address the scope of the consumer fraud act as a matter of statutory interpretation that issue simply was not presented.see nix smith,a judicial opinion is a response to the issues before the court,and these opinions,like others,must be read in light of the issues that were before the court for determination.nevertheless,to the extent that martin i is relevant here,it is distinguishable.
in martin i,this court specifically based its decision on the following facts the contracts containing the deceptive statements were all executed in illinois the defendant principal place of business was in illinois the contract contained express and clauses specifying that any litigation would be conducted in illinois under illinois law complaints regarding the defendant performance were to be directed to its chicago office and payments for the defendant services were to be sent to its chicago office.given these circumstances,this court concluded that the act could apply to the whole class.martin i,at.
in contrast to martin i,there are virtually no circumstances relating to the disputed claims practices at issue in this case which occurred or existed in illinois for those plaintiffs who are not illinois residents.the appellate court conclusion that a scheme to defraud was disseminated from state farm headquarters is insufficient.see,rohlfing manor care,where the only connection with illinois is the headquarters of the defendant or the fact that a scheme emanated from illinois,the consumer fraud act does not apply to the claims of the plaintiffs even under the broad application of the act endorsed by martin and other similar cases.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that the circuit court erred in certifying a nationwide class that included class members whose claims proceedings took place outside illinois.because we have decided the propriety of the certification order on statutory interpretation grounds,we need not consider whether certification of the nationwide class was unconstitutional or violated rules.
the only putative class that can exist in this case under the consumer fraud act is a class consisting of policyholders whose vehicles were assessed and repaired in illinois.four of the five named plaintiffs in this case,avery,covington,shadle and vickers,are not residents of illinois,the damage to their vehicles did not occur in illinois,they did not receive their repair estimates in illinois,and they did not have their cars repaired in illinois.these individuals have no cause of action under the act.the only named plaintiff in this case whose vehicle was assessed and repaired in illinois and,therefore,the only named plaintiff who can serve as a representative plaintiff for the putative illinois class,is sam defrank.because a failure of defrank claim would render discussion of class certification issues moot see,oliveira amoco oil,we now turn to the propriety of the judgment in favor of defrank.
propriety of judgment named plaintiff 
to succeed in a private cause of action under the consumer fraud act,a plaintiff must prove a deceptive act or practice by the defendant,the defendant intent that the plaintiff rely on the deception,the occurrence of the deception in the course of conduct involving trade or commerce,and actual damage to the plaintiff proximately caused by the deception.oliveira,at.in general,a trial court decision as to whether these elements have been proven in any case is reviewed under the manifest weight of the evidence standard.kirkruff wisegarver,d.
state farm contends that the named plaintiffs,including defrank,failed to prove several of the elements required to establish a private cause of action.state farm also contends that the circuit court held plaintiffs to the wrong burden of proof.we address this issue first.
burden of proof 
the circuit court below held,as a matter of law,that plaintiffs must prove the elements of a private cause of action under section a of the act by a preponderance of the evidence.the appellate court agreed.d at.state farm contends that these holdings are incorrect and that the proper burden of proof in this case is clear and convincing evidence.
in the ordinary civil case,because there are no sound reasons for favoring one party over another,the party with the burden of persuasion must prove his or her case by a preponderance of the evidence.a proposition proved by a preponderance of the evidence is one that has been found to be more probably true than not true.occasionally,however,policy considerations require a court to impose a higher standard of proof.in such a case,the party with the burden of persuasion must prove his or her case by clear and convincing evidence.bazydlo volant,see arrington walter heller international,d.
in the context of common law fraud,the law presumes that transactions are fair and honest fraud is not presumed.accordingly,fraud must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.racine fuel rawlins,see gordon dolin,d,observing that in a common law fraud action,the plaintiff carries a heavy responsibility.
the consumer fraud act does not expressly provide the standard of proof required to succeed in a private cause of action.however,as noted,the act is to be liberally construed to effect its purpose,which is to provide broader protection to consumers than an action for common law fraud.accordingly,based on the liberal intent of the legislature behind the act,and based on the fact that the act does not expressly require a greater standard of proof,the appellate court has held that the appropriate standard of proof for a statutory fraud claim is preponderance of the evidence.see cuculich thomson consumer electronics,d,malooley alice,d.
in this case,the appellate court agreed with this reasoning and conclusion.d at.we do likewise and so hold.cases requiring a clear and convincing standard of proof see,general motors acceptance grissom,d,munjal baird warner,d,are overruled on this point.
the deceptive act or practice 
when state farm specified a part in one of its repairs,it disclosed the use of that part in the policyholder estimate and.see appendix a and appendix b.as noted previously,the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint against state farm is that this disclosure was inadequate.according to plaintiffs,state farm should also have disclosed the categorical inferiority of parts.its failure to do so,plaintiffs contend,constituted a deceptive act or practice under the act.
there are several difficulties with plaintiffs argument.recall that plaintiffs do not contend that all parts are defective,only that they are all not as good as oem parts.state farm knew this fact,plaintiffs allege,and should have disclosed it to all policyholders.but many businesses undoubtedly sell products with the knowledge that those products are not as good as other brands on the market.under plaintiffs reasoning,it would appear that to avoid liability under the act,every knowing sale of a brand of product which is not the top brand would have to carry a disclaimer notice,our brand is not,on the whole,as good as our competitor.thus,adopting plaintiffs argument would appear to work a significant expansion of liability under the act.
further,and of equal importance,we note that the disclosure provided by state farm was required by,and complied with,state law.
section of the insurance code provides 
a purpose.the purpose of this section is to regulate the use of aftermarket crash parts by requiring disclosure when any use of an aftermarket equipment manufacturer crash part is proposed and by requiring that the manufacturers of such aftermarket crash parts be identified.
b definitions.
c identification.any aftermarket crash part supplied by a equipment manufacturer for use in this state after the effective date of this act shall have affixed thereto or inscribed thereon the logo or name of its manufacturer.the manufacturer logo or name shall be visible after installation whenever practicable.
d disclosure.no insurer shall specify the use of aftermarket crash parts in the repair of an insured motor vehicle,nor shall any repair facility or installer use aftermarket crash parts to repair a vehicle unless the customer is advised of that fact in writing.in all instances where an insurer intends that aftermarket crash parts be used in the repair of a motor vehicle,the insurer shall provide the customer with the following information 
a written estimate that clearly identifies each aftermarket crash part and 
a disclosure settlement incorporated into or attached to the estimate that reads as follows this estimate has been prepared based on the use of crash parts supplied by a source other than the manufacturer of your motor vehicle.warranties applicable to these replacements parts are provided by the manufacturer or distributor of these parts rather than the manufacturer of your vehicle.ilcs west.
state farm compliance with section of the insurance code raises an important issue.like most state consumer fraud statutes,the illinois consumer fraud act exempts from its coverage practices or transactions which are permitted by other laws.section of the consumer fraud act provides 
nothing in this act shall apply to any of the following 
actions or transactions specifically authorized by laws administered by any regulatory body or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the united states.ilcs west.
interpreting illinois decisions which have addressed this provision,the seventh circuit has stated 
taken together,the illinois cases stand for the proposition that the state consumer fraud act will not impose higher disclosure requirements on parties than those that are sufficient to satisfy federal regulations.if the parties are doing something specifically authorized by federal law,section will protect them from liability under the act.on the other hand,the consumer fraud act exemption is not available for statements that manage to be in technical compliance with federal regulations,but which are so misleading or deceptive in context that federal law itself might not regard them as adequate.emphasis omitted.bober glaxo wellcome plc,cir.
the insurance code does not require insurance companies to disclose that parts are categorically inferior to oem parts.indeed,contrary to the findings of the circuit court below,it would appear that by allowing and regulating the use of parts in illinois,the general assembly has made the policy determination that at least some number of parts are not inferior to oem parts.otherwise,the general assembly decision to permit their use makes little sense.see snell geico,no.civ,slip op.at,wl.august,reasoning that,if state insurance commissioners would not sanction the use of inferior parts,and if,nevertheless,they sanctioned the use of parts in some instances,these insurance commissioners must have determined that parts are not categorically and universally inferior emphases in original.
in light of section of the insurance code,and section of the act,we believe that there is a serious question as to whether state farm failure to disclose to its policyholders that parts are not as good as oem parts can be considered a deceptive act or practice.however,state farm does not press this issue and we need not explore it further.we express no opinion as to the proper scope of section of the act or the correctness of the bober decision,or whether state farm committed a deceptive act or practice within the meaning of the consumer fraud act.instead,we conclude that defrank claim fails because he suffered no actual damage,as required under the act,and because he failed to establish proximate causation.
actual damage 
the most striking deficiency in defrank claim that state farm violated the consumer fraud act is his lack of actual damage.in order to sustain a private cause of action under the act,a plaintiff must prove that he or she suffered actual damage as a result of a violation of the act.ilcs a west oliveira,at,in this case,defrank did not suffer any damage as a result of state farm specification or use of parts.
the incident that gave rise to defrank claim occurred on november,when his chevrolet pickup truck was damaged in an accident.defrank testified that state farm estimate for repair of his truck included parts and that these parts were used in the truck repair.defrank stated that several months later he sold his truck to his for,slightly below the blue book value of,in what defrank himself agreed was an arm length transaction.defrank was asked by plaintiffs counsel at trial whether the parts on the truck were a factor in the sale.his answer was no.on,this point was made clear 
counsel for state farm and there were no discounts in the price that you sold the truck for to your on account of the fact that there were parts on the car is that right 
defrank right.
is that correct 
the language of the consumer fraud act is plain.a plaintiff must prove actual damage before he or she can recover under the act.that did not occur here.defrank own testimony establishes that,when he sold his truck to his,he received the same value for the truck that he would have received if only oem parts had been used in the repair.it simply made no difference that parts were present on the truck.clearly,defrank suffered no actual damage as a result of state farm specification or use of parts and,therefore,he can not recover under the act 
the appellate court offered no explanation as to how defrank,or any other members of the class,suffered actual damage within the meaning of the consumer fraud act,while the circuit court offered only a brief statement on the issue.in a single sentence in its judgment order,the circuit court held that plaintiffs damages under the consumer fraud count were defined in the same manner as they were under the breach of contract count.thus,according to the circuit court,actual damages were defined as specification and installation damages.as with the breach of contract count,specification damages occurred at the moment state farm specified a part in a policyholder repair estimate.installation damages consisted of the cost of replacing parts with oem parts on those vehicles which had actually had parts installed.neither of these theories establishes that defrank suffered any damage under the consumer fraud act.
first,defrank no longer owns his truck,which was sold for fair market value.accordingly,as plaintiffs own damages expert,mathur,acknowledged at trial,defrank is not entitled to installation damages.
second,reliance on specification damages is entirely inappropriate for defrank consumer fraud claim.as explained in our discussion of plaintiffs breach of contract count,specification damages are not,in fact,real or measurable damages and,hence,in no way constitute actual damage within the meaning of the act.in addition,with respect to defrank consumer fraud claim,specification damages make no chronological sense.under plaintiffs theory of specification damages,the damage done to defrank occurred at the moment state farm specified parts in its repair estimate.however,the alleged misrepresentations made to defrank,and the alleged failure to disclose the categorical inferiority of parts,occurred after specification,when defrank was handed his estimate and the brochure.actual damage can not be the result of omissions and misrepresentations which are made after the damage has already occurred.connick suzuki motor.
perhaps aware of the temporal problems that arise when actual damage is defined as the mere specification of parts,the appellate court offered an additional explanation of damage which,at least implicitly,resolves this problem.the appellate court stated 
there is evidence that state farm material misrepresentations led numerous class members to blindly accept the parts specified,without knowledge of the inferior condition of those parts.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule 
notice what the appellate court has done here.with this sentence,it is no longer the case that damage occurred when parts were specified.instead,the damage occurred when parts were accepted.this is not the theory of damages which was adopted by the circuit court,nor is it the theory advanced by plaintiffs.
the new theory of damages offered by the appellate court has the virtue of making chronological sense because it places the deception before the damage.applying this reasoning to defrank case,defrank would first have received an estimate and a brochure,and the omissions in those documents would then have deceived him into blindly accept ing the parts specified without knowledge of their categorical inferiority.however,this theory still does not explain how defrank was actually damaged within the meaning of the consumer fraud act.as noted above,even though defrank accepted the parts that were placed on his truck,he suffered no damage whatsoever as a result of that acceptance.accordingly,because state farm specification or use of parts did not cause defrank any actual damage,his consumer fraud claim is without merit.
proximate deception 
the appellate court conclusion that state farm representations led numerous class members to blindly accept the parts specified without knowledge of their categorical inferiority can not apply in defrank case for an additional of proximate causation.
in a series of three cases,this court has held that in a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation brought under the consumer fraud act,a plaintiff must prove that he or she was actually deceived by the misrepresentation in order to establish the element of proximate causation.the three cases are zekman direct american marketers,oliveira amoco oil,and shannon boise cascade.
in the case at bar,state farm argues that under zekman and oliveira shannon was not yet filed at the time of briefing and argument,defrank consumer fraud claim must fail because he has not established that he was actually deceived by any omissions or representations made by state farm.plaintiffs,in response,argue that zekman and oliveira are distinguishable from the present case because those cases involved deceptive advertising and alleged fraud on the market,misrepresentations made to the public at large,rather than misrepresentations directed specifically at plaintiffs as policyholders.according to plaintiffs,a covenant of good faith is implied in every contract and the presence of such a covenant here gave rise to a relationship quite different than the attenuated nexus between a merchant and prospective consumer in an impersonal deceptive advertising campaign.
though not entirely clear,it appears that plaintiffs are arguing in favor of a different definition of causation for those individuals who have contracts with a consumer fraud defendant versus those who do not.to the extent that this is plaintiffs argument,we reject it.further,and more importantly,we reject plaintiffs attempt to distinguish zekman and oliveira.the critical point of these cases is not that they involved advertising.rather,the important legal principle established in zekman,oliveira and shannon is that in a case alleging deception under the act,it is not possible for a plaintiff to establish proximate causation unless the plaintiff can show that he or she was,in some manner,deceived by the misrepresentation.oliveira,at.proximate causation is an element of all private causes of action under the act.thus,defrank must establish that he was deceived by state farm representations or omissions in order to prove his claim.
the circuit court did not discuss deception in its judgment order and the court entire analysis of proximate causation is contained in its finding that as a direct and proximate result of state farm violation of the consumer fraud act,the plaintiffs were injured and incurred actual damages.the appellate court did address deception,although in a summary fashion.the court stated,without further explanation,that t here is overwhelming evidence of state farm calculated deception of its policyholders.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule.
the notion that defrank was deceived by the omissions or representations in his estimate and brochure into accepting parts is categorically refuted by the record.at trial,defrank gave the following testimony 
plaintiffs counsel i may have asked you this.did you report the collision to state farm 
defrank yes.
q.did you report it promptly 
okay.tell the jury what happened,sam,after you called state farm.
a.they made an appointment with me to take my truck to the claims center which is out by the airport.
and which i did on that particular day.
okay.was it on november the that you did that 
okay.tell the jury what happened on november the when you went out there.
well,i took my truck to the claims center.i pulled it inside.and the fellow there started looking it over.and i said,oh,yeah.by the way,i said,i want all gm parts on that truck.
q.why did you happen to bring that up 
seeing commercials on tv where they say,you know,keep your gm car all gm.
okay.that was all you knew about it 
a.that was all i knew about it at the time.
q.what did he tell you 
a.he said,we will talk about that later.
q.did that indicate did you think 
i figured something was up.
okay.did you talk to a man claim representative or somebody named richard hill 
okay.when did you do that 
yeah.when did you do that was that while the truck 
a.while this other fellow was looking at my truck and,i guess,writing the estimate on that,we went into his office.
richard hill 
richard hill office.
okay.and did what sic hill give you 
a.we talked for a little bit,and then he handed me a little brochure from state farm.
a.that stated their policy.
okay.did it tell you their policy about what 
a.if they used parts on your vehicle.
q.that they would use 
a.that they stand behind it.yeah.
q.what was your reaction to finding out that they were going to use parts on your vehicle 
i was very upset.
q.did you complain 
a.did i to hill at that time yes.
and what was hill response to you 
a.he just promised me basically said that there was how they do it,and that they stand behind their parts.if i had any trouble they would take care of me.
defrank testimony makes it abundantly clear that he was not deceived by anything state farm said,or did not say,regarding the quality of parts.even before he spoke to the state farm adjuster,defrank believed,in his own mind,that parts were not as good as oem parts.otherwise,he would not have insisted that gm parts be installed on his truck.further,defrank would not have become,in his words,very upset upon learning that parts were to be used on his truck unless he believed that parts were not as good as oem parts.
neither the appellate court nor the circuit court addressed defrank testimony or explained how,in light of that testimony,it can be said that he blindly accepted the parts without knowledge of their categorical inferiority.d,quote contained in a portion of the opinion unpublished under supreme court rule.defrank plainly was not deceived by state farm estimate or quality replacement parts brochure.because he was not deceived by state farm,defrank failed to establish the proximate causation necessary to recover under the consumer fraud act.
in light of the above,it is clear that defrank suffered no actual damage,and that he failed to establish proximate causation.for these reasons,defrank failed to prove a private cause of action under the consumer fraud act.because defrank,as the representative plaintiff,has not proven his claim for consumer fraud,there can be no illinois class for plaintiffs consumer fraud count.see,oliveira,at,charles hester enterprises,illinois founders insurance.therefore,we reverse the judgments of the circuit and appellate courts in favor of plaintiffs on the consumer fraud count.
d.other issues 
in light of our disposition of plaintiffs consumer fraud claim,we need not reach other issues raised by state farm in relation to that claim,including the propriety of the circuit court punitive damages award.
iii.equitable and declaratory relief 
in count iii of their third amended complaint,plaintiffs sought a declaration of rights and a permanent injunction that would,inter alia,prohibit state farm from representing that crash parts are of like kind and quality to oem crash parts or that crash parts can restore a vehicle to its condition.the circuit court granted plaintiffs declaratory relief.the court entered a declaration which stated,in essence,that state farm contractual obligation was the same with respect to each member of the class,regardless of variations in policy language and state regulations.however,the court declined to award plaintiffs injunctive relief,finding that money damages constituted an adequate remedy at law.
in light of our disposition of plaintiffs claims for breach of contract and statutory consumer fraud,we affirm the circuit court denial of equitable relief.we reverse the circuit court granting of declaratory relief.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,that portion of the circuit court judgment which denied plaintiffs request for equitable relief is affirmed.all other portions of the circuit court judgment are reversed.those portions of the appellate court judgment which affirmed the denial of equitable relief and which reversed the circuit court award of disgorgement damages are affirmed.all other portions of the appellate court judgment are reversed.
appellate court judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part circuit court judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.
i agree with my colleagues with respect to some,but not all,of the issues raised in this appeal.apart from my disagreement on these legal matters,i am troubled by the tone and tenor of today opinion.i,therefore,write separately to explain my views.
breach of contract 
the court reverses the jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff class outright,based on several different rationales.i agree with two major points.first,i concur in the judgment that the nationwide class certification can not stand.while i disagree with the court analysis,i believe its conclusion is correct.further,although the court rightly concludes that the specification damages have no basis in law,thus necessitating reversal,i can not completely join in this portion of the court opinion because of some unnecessary dicta.
notwithstanding the above,i respectfully disagree with the remainder of the court conclusions on the breach of contract claim,and dissent therefrom.as i will explain,the court errs in its conclusion that plaintiffs can not prove a breach of any of the various insurance policies in effect during the class period.moreover,i do not believe that the jury engaged in improper speculation in awarding installation damages,such as would necessitate this court stepping in and overruling the jury verdict.
nationwide certification 
the court concludes that nationwide certification was erroneous because the various contracts state farm uses in different states can not all be interpreted as promising the same thing.although i agree with the ultimate result reached by my,too,would find that the circuit court erred in certifying the nationwide disagree with the court reasoning.
as an initial matter,the court analysis with respect to this issue is plagued by inconsistencies.for example,the court criticizes the circuit court conclusion that there is a unitary contractual promise,noting that the various contracts contain different language and that there is no evidence to support the conclusion that the language is irrelevant to determining state farm obligations to its insureds.see at.at,at.the court specifically holds that the like kind and quality policy form and the condition form are not the same.emphasis in original.at.at,at.but later,the court inexplicably accepts state farm argument that t he term like kind and quality,as used in the relevant policies,meant sufficient to restore a vehicle to its condition.at.at,at.in other words,despite what the court said earlier,it ultimately concludes that the promises in the two contracts are the same.if the promises are the same,then any differences between the forms are irrelevant.
in another example of inconsistency,the court states that the circuit court should have ruled before trial on the issue of whether state farm various contract forms had a unitary promise.at.at,at.however,when it comes to reviewing the lower courts rulings,the court holds that there is simply no evidentiary support for the lower courts conclusion that there is a unitary promise.emphasis added.at.at,at.the evidentiary support the court considers but finds wanting consists,of course,of information adduced at trial.see at.at,at.this is clearly inconsistent with the earlier statement that the circuit court ought to have decided the issue before trial began,in light of the fact that the court properly,in my to entertain the possibility that evidence adduced at trial could demonstrate that state farm had a common obligation to all of its policyholders,regardless of variations in the contracts state farm drafted.
moreover,the court rejection of the evidence adduced at,the testimony of don withstand scrutiny.first,i note that the court characterizes porter as a state farm property consultant in auto general claims.at.at,at.this description connotes that porter is the equivalent of a lower level employee.in reality,porter,a state farm witness,worked at the state farm home office in bloomington as one of only state farm property consultants in the entire nation.at the time of trial,he had been a state farm employee for years.porter specifically testified that he was here to testify to what we do as an organization and what i know that my comrades do when we talk about the use of these parts.
porter testified,as the court admits,that state farm had a uniform nationwide practice restoring the vehicle to its condition.at.at,at.the court,however,determines that it may ignore this testimony because porter did not specifically refer to each and every form of contract which state farm used.i do not believe that the court is respecting the standard of review.had porter testified that he arranged his bookshelves in alphabetical order by title,we would not refuse to accord this testimony weight because he did not specifically testify that he placed moby dick before wuthering heights.porter was no neophyte,and he was testifying to the practices of state farm as an organization.his testimony can not be brushed away on the basis that he might not have been talking about state farm as a whole.
the court also interprets porter testimony in the light least favorable to the result reached by the circuit court,stating that his general testimony regarding state farm practices related only to state farm philosophy,and not its contractual obligations.in other words,the court overrules the circuit court because although state farm might have had a nationwide philosophy,its various policies might have promised,state farm might as a matter of philosophy give its policyholders more than the benefits for which they have paid.although it might make a nice sound bite for state farm advertisements,this is simply conjecture,not a valid basis for overruling the circuit court.we must defer to the circuit court interpretation of testimony unless it is clearly erroneous.that standard clearly has not been reached here.at best,the court is suggesting another possible interpretation of the testimony at issue and substituting its judgment for the circuit court.this is not a reviewing court role.porter,during his testimony,made a general,categorical statement that state farm had an overarching consistent obligation.as the court admits,porter knew that state farm had several differently worded policies it is not as if he were unaware that state farm chose to use different language in its policies in different states.nevertheless,he testified that its obligation was everywhere the same.
the court also makes much of porter numerous statements that state farm only intent was to restore its insureds vehicles to their condition.indeed,porter repeated this phrase no less than times during the course of his testimony.but sometimes,another answer slipped through.for instance,when asked whether state farm treated all insureds equally with respect to specifying crash parts,porter testified,in my experience,we do.it does make any difference the age of the vehicle,the type of the vehicle.emphasis added.this cuts against the court argument that state farm obligation depends on the preloss condition of every individual vehicle,as a vehicle age is a component of its preloss condition.at another point,counsel for state farm asked porter to supply his definition of the term part.he responded 
well,a part to me is a part that made by other than the original manufacturer.and,you know,but it simply to me,is you buy a part from ford and if the ford fender was made by ford,but you can buy that fender that that originally produced by ford by another manufacturing firm that has produced the same type of fender or fenders as good as the fender that was the oem fender.emphasis added.
here porter clearly testified that parts had to be as good as oem parts.
on,porter was asked about a confidential internal state farm memorandum,titled general claims memorandum gcm i will return to this document later.porter admitted that this document required that parts must be of oem quality.plaintiffs counsel subsequently posed the following question to porter,and received the following response 
yes,sir.now,is there a guarantee else other than this general claims memo that guarantees that these parts will be made out of the same construction and have the same structural integrity as the oem parts 
a.you know,sir,i would have to say that,yes,it does after all because it says quality replacement part,and when we say quality replacement part,we mean those parts that are as good as the parts that were on the vehicle at the time of the loss.emphases added.
porter here made clear that the term quality replacement part,which meant parts that are as good as the parts that were on the vehicle at the time of the loss,was a guarantee of oem quality.thus,here,porter equated the guarantee to restore the vehicle to preloss condition with a guarantee of replacement parts.this telling admission wholly undermines the court theory that preloss condition destroys commonality,because if preloss condition means oem quality,then a vehicle can not be restored to preloss condition with a part which falls short of oem quality,and thus individual examinations of plaintiffs vehicles is not necessary if,as the jury concluded,all parts are of lesser quality than oem parts 
the jury was entitled to believe porter admissions in plaintiffs favor over his constant repetition of a term favoring state farm,his employer.the court proffered reasons for disregarding porter testimony are simply untenable.
the court treatment of porter testimony,moreover,is not an isolated event.i am troubled by the court more appropriately its lack of the evidence adduced at trial.this case comes before this court on appeal from a trial which lasted more than seven days elapsed between opening statements on august,and the jury october verdict.over the course of the trial,witnesses testified,with the circuit court admitting into evidence well over exhibits.before the case even went to trial,there were over two years of pretrial proceedings between the filing of plaintiffs original class action complaint in july and the august beginning of trial.the common law record alone runs to more than pages of filings.and yet,in an opinion,the court devotes less than two full pages to its initial recitation of the facts.it concerns me,as it ought to concern anyone,to see that the actual evidence adduced in this case is given such short shrift.
as i stated at the outset of this separate opinion,however,i do ultimately agree with my colleagues that the nationwide class can not stand.initially,i believe that the circuit court abused its discretion in applying illinois law to the contracts between state farm and residents.illinois follows the restatement second of conflict of laws in making decisions.morris chapman associates,kitzman.the restatement provides that when the parties have not made an effective choice of law,the factors of possible relevance to choice of law in breach of contract cases are 
a the place of contracting,
b the place of negotiation of the contract,
c the place of performance,
d the location of the subject matter of the contract,and 
e the domicil,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties,
which are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.restatement second of conflict of laws,at.in the context of insurance contracts,
t he rights created thereby are determined by the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy,unless with respect to the particular issue,some other state has a more significant relationship to the transaction and the parties,in which event the local law of the other state will be applied.restatement second of conflict of laws,at.
accord westchester fire insurance heileman brewing,d.with respect to automobile insurance contracts,the principal location of the insured risk is that location in which the vehicle is to be garaged during most of the insurance policy term.restatement second of conflict of laws,comment b,at.
of the above factors,the only one which would appear to militate in favor of applying illinois law to the contracts is the fact that state farm is an illinois resident.the most important factor,the location of the insured insureds cut against application of illinois law.the contracts would not have been delivered in illinois.the insureds would not be domiciled in illinois.and the last act to give rise to a valid the insureds signatures or the deposit of checks in the likely would not have occurred in illinois.consideration of the relevant factors would appear to militate strongly against applying illinois law to the entire multistate class in this case.
moreover,even if the fact of state farm illinois domicile sufficed to uphold application of illinois law according to illinois choice of law principles,doing so would not pass constitutional muster.in phillips petroleum shutts,d,the supreme court reviewed a class action brought in kansas against phillips petroleum for recovery of interest on royalties in oil and gas contracts.the contracts at issue were entered into in different states.even though most of the contracts were entered into outside kansas,the kansas supreme court upheld its trial court decision to apply kansas law to the entire action.
the supreme court reversed.the court stated that even in a case where multiple choices of law might be possible,the forum court choice of law had to comply with constitutional guarantees of due process.shutts,at.at,d at in many situations a state court may be free to apply one of several choices of law.but the constitutional limitations must be respected even in a nationwide class action.the court rejected the rule formulated by the kansas supreme court that where a state court determines it has jurisdiction over a nationwide class action and procedural due process guarantees of notice and adequate representation are present,we believe the law of the forum should be applied unless compelling reasons exist for applying a different law.shutts,at.at,d at,quoting shutts phillips petroleum.the court also noted that a plaintiff choice of the forum state evinced by having filed the suit of little relevance.shutts,at.at,d at.rather,the court held that to apply its own law,the forum state must have a significant contact or significant aggregation of contacts to the claims asserted by each member of the plaintiff class,contacts creating state interests,in order to ensure that the choice of the forum state law is not arbitrary or unfair.shutts,at.at,d at.the court concluded that,in the case before it,g iven the forum state lack of interest in claims unrelated to that state,and the substantive conflict with jurisdictions such as texas,we conclude that application of the forum state law to every claim in this case is sufficiently arbitrary and unfair as to exceed constitutional limits.shutts,at.at,d at.
the same shortcomings that caused the supreme court to find a constitutional violation in shutts are present in the instant case.as in shutts,there are significant differences between the law of illinois and the laws of other states regarding the breach of contract action.for instance,our circuit and appellate courts determined that state farm promise to have repairs performed with parts of like kind and quality meant of like kind and quality to oem parts,a conclusion with which i agree.however,as state farm observes,courts in other jurisdictions have not so construed the language.see,ray farmers insurance exchange,d,like kind and quality means substantially the same condition as before the accident,quoting owens pyeatt,d,schwendeman usaa casualty insurance,see also berry state farm mutual automobile insurance.other states have expressly provided by statute or regulation that parts may be used in repairs so long as they are the equivalent of the part on the vehicle immediately prior to the accident.see.tit.admin.regs.application of these jurisdictions laws would change the outcome of the instant case.
it is possible for a forum state to have a sufficient interest in the resolution of the claims of litigants as to render the application of the forum state law neither arbitrary nor fundamentally unfair despite differences.shutts,at.at,d at.however,i do not believe that illinois has such an interest in the instant action.it is true that state farm is an illinois corporate citizen,and illinois does have an interest in regulating its conduct.however,illinois does not have any particularly compelling interest in protecting the rights of the citizens of other states,especially given that there is no indication that the other states are unable or unwilling to vindicate the rights of their citizens within their own court systems,according to their own laws.moreover,neither state farm nor any policyholder would appear to have had any reasonable expectation that illinois law would govern their contractual dispute.see shutts,at.at,d at fairness calculus must take into account the reasonable expectations of parties as to which state law would control.thus,i believe that applying illinois law to the entire nationwide class which the circuit court certified in this case would run afoul of the due process concerns spelled out in shutts,and i would reverse the multistate certification for this reason.see state ex rel.american family mutual insurance clark.
contract interpretation 
having determined that the nationwide class can not stand,the court next examines whether the verdict may be upheld with respect to any subclass.at.at,at.the court concludes that the question must be answered in the negative.the court actually answers this question in two paragraphs,with no analysis nor citation to authority,based on the verdict form.see at.at,at.this ought,perhaps,to be the end of the opinion.but,the court quickly turns the reader eye away from the paucity of its analysis of what is apparently the determinative issue in the case by turning to a lengthy exegesis of the individual policy forms.
before reviewing the court conclusion that,as a matter of law,the plaintiffs failed to prove a breach of any promise state farm made in any of the various policies state farm drafted,it is helpful to recall the overarching theme of the plaintiffs complaint.at its heart,plaintiffs complaint was that state farm promised policyholders that their vehicles would be repaired with parts,but the parts state farm specified for repairs were simply not as good as oem parts and that state farm knew it.state farm knowingly specified the inferior parts,plaintiffs contended,because they were cheaper.these contentions can not be ignored,when one considers the evidence adduced at trial.plaintiffs presented to the jury numerous internal state farm memoranda that detailed problems with parts,some of which criticized parts as a class.one such memorandum went so far as to state specifically,in contrasting galvanized oem parts with nongalvanized parts,that we may well say it is like kind and quality,but the bottom line is that it is not the same.plaintiffs also presented expert testimony to the effect that parts were categorically inferior to oem parts and thus were never of like kind and quality.state farm does not challenge these experts bona fides on review,and thus their conclusions must be accepted.i believe it is important to note that a reviewing court neither can substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact nor can it set aside a verdict simply because the trier of fact could have drawn different conclusions from conflicting testimony.doser savage manufacturing sales.although state farm presented its own expert witnesses,a battle of the experts is a situation in which reviewing courts are especially loathe to the findings made by the trier of fact.see in re glenville.
the court avoids discussing the evidence presented by plaintiffs by holding that state farm never promised any policyholders that repairs would utilize parts of equal quality to oem parts.thus,according to my colleagues,it does not matter whether state farm was knowingly repairing its policyholders vehicles with inferior parts,because state farm never promised to use noninferior parts.i suggest that the court has perhaps insufficiently considered the policy implications of overturning a billion dollar verdict on the basis that an insurer knowing usage of inferior parts is good enough.i am not stating that parts are by definition inferior my point is that plaintiffs alleged,and by its verdict the jury found,that as of now parts are not up to the standards of oem factual conclusion the court avoids addressing.the quality of parts could change in the future,but the court does not dispute that the crash parts state farm was actually specifying for repairs were inferior to their oem counterparts.
in addition to being bad policy,the court conclusion is also based on a flawed analysis of the relevant contractual provisions.in this regard i note a piece of evidence which the court has remarkably determined to be irrelevant.in,state farm vice president of claims penned a confidential internal memorandum,known as general claims memorandum hereinafter gcm.therein,he discussed the quality of the parts to be used in repairs.is,state farm vice president of distinguished between what was required of aftermarket parts and what was required of salvage parts.as an aid to understanding the memorandum,i note that it is uncontroverted that aftermarket is a synonym for,and it is also uncontroverted that salvage parts are,as the name implies,a lower grade than parts.in comparing the two grades of parts,state farm vice president of claims had this to say 
aftermarket parts must be of oem quality that quality must be guaranteed by the supplier 
salvage parts must be of equal,or better,quality compared to the parts being replaced.emphases in original.
thus state farm specifically required that parts be of equal quality to oem parts,only holding salvage parts to the lesser standard of equivalence to the parts being replaced.
one might think that this would be the end of the matter.a reasonable reader might expect that a reviewing court would affirm the lower court conclusion that parts had to be of equal quality to oem parts,given a memorandum by state farm vice president of claims which precisely so stated.the court,however,does not consider whether gcm ought to be treated as a binding admission by state farm,because the court,in a footnote,concludes that gcm is irrelevant.see at.at,at.instead,the court performs its own investigation into the policies at issue,ignoring the fact that state farm has already said that its aftermarket parts must be of oem quality,as opposed to salvage parts,a lower grade,which are merely required to be of equal quality to the parts being replaced.
even if the court were correct to so blatantly ignore the evidence,its analysis of the contracts is logically faulty.for instance,in what the court calls the you agree policies see at.at,at heading,state farm promises to restore the insured vehicle to its condition.this particular form of the contract also contains what the court calls the you agree language you agree with us that such parts may include either parts furnished by the vehicle manufacturer or parts from other sources including equipment manufacturers.emphasis in original.see at.at,at.
the court defense of this policy form is twofold,and begins by focusing on the you agree language.the court reasons that by agreeing to this language a policyholder has implicitly admitted that there must exist at least some parts capable of satisfying state farm promise.the court construes this admission strictly against the policyholder in startling contrast to the court treatment of state farm admission in gcm that parts must be of equal quality to oem parts.see at.at,at.
first,one must recall that this is an insurance classic contract of adhesion.see cramer insurance exchange agency,freeman,specially concurring it is well established that an insurance contract is one of adhesion see also williams illinois state scholarship comm n,adhesion contracts are those in which the parties are in a disparate bargaining position,and one party has no hand in drafting the agreement but,rather,must take it or leave it as the other party has drafted.contractual clauses which are part of a boilerplate agreement in a contract of adhesion have their significance greatly reduced because of the inequality in the parties bargaining power.williams,at.the average person has no ability to bargain over the individual clauses of his or her auto insurance policy.the court ignores this fact,and seriously damages the credibility of its analysis by doing so.the notion that a policyholder has entered into a binding,factual admission simply by purchasing an auto insurance policy would merely be laughable if the court was not seriously suggesting it as a basis for overturning a billion dollar verdict produced by a trial in which the evidence supports the conclusion that an insurer knowingly specified inferior crash parts for repairs of its policyholders vehicles.
more overridingly,however,even ignoring the injustice of strictly construing a contract of adhesion in favor of the drafter,the court analysis is logically flawed.the you agree language is not an admission that there exist parts which will restore vehicles to their preloss condition.it is merely an agreement that if state farm proposes to perform a repair with a part which is sufficient to restore a vehicle to its preloss condition,the insured can not object to the part simply because it is.but if parts are not sufficient to restore vehicles to their preloss condition,as plaintiffs have consistently maintained and as the jury by its verdict found,the policyholder can not be not forced to accept it simply because of the you agree language.
the fallacy of the court position is better viewed when one examines how it would play out in the context of other policies state farm could have issued.suppose,for example,that state farm knew that all of the major auto manufacturers were considering building plants in a foreign country that i shall designate as country a.in anticipation of the plants being built and in order to forestall any complaints by policyholders about receiving parts produced in country a,state farm amended its policy so as to provide that 
you agree with us that such parts may include parts furnished by the vehicle manufacturer,including parts manufactured in country 
the reasoning employed by the court in the instant case would hold that everyone insured under this policy has entered into a binding admission that there are general motors parts manufactured in country a which are of sufficient quality to restore their vehicles to preloss condition.this is logically fallacious.recall that the policy language in my hypothetical was drafted in advance of the plant in country a being built,and thus at the time it went into use,there did not exist any general motors parts made in country a.a plain reading of this language is,rather,a concession by the insured that if a part manufactured in country a suffices to restore his vehicle to its preloss condition,he may not reject the part simply because of its origin in country 
my colleagues might protest that this hypothetical is it may no more so than the court tortured reading of language in a contract of adhesion against innocent policyholders in order to avoid having to acknowledge the proofs adduced at trial.the underlying point remains that the language upon which the court relies is not an admission by an insured that there exist parts which suffice to restore a vehicle to its preloss condition.it is merely an agreement that if there are such parts,the insured may not refuse to accept them simply because they are parts.
the second stage of the court defense of this policy form focuses on the fact that state farm promise is to restore the insured vehicle to its condition.the court believes that this policy form is unsuited to be the basis of a class action because to determine whether a vehicle has been restored to its preloss condition requires determination of the condition of each individual policyholder vehicle before the loss and after repair,and this multitude of individual questions would overwhelm any question common to the subclass.at.at,at.
however,as i have already noted,state farm witness porter testified that the term quality replacement part,which meant parts that are as good as the parts that were on the vehicle at the time of the loss,was a guarantee of oem quality.this testimony equates the guarantee to restore the vehicle to preloss condition with a guarantee of replacement parts,which undermines the court theory that preloss condition destroys commonality.if preloss condition means oem quality,as porter testimony reveals,then a vehicle can not be restored to preloss condition with a part which falls short of oem quality.thus if,as the jury concluded,all parts are of lesser quality than oem parts,individual examinations of plaintiffs vehicles are not necessary.state farm does not argue in its briefs to this court that the circuit court erred in determining that the condition and like kind and quality promises are the same.indeed,to the contrary,state farm affirmatively argues that the promises are the same,an argument the majority accepts.see at.at,at.
accordingly,the court has failed to demonstrate any reason that plaintiffs would be barred from recovering under the you agree policies.
the court analysis of the like kind and quality policies also falls short.here,the court examines those policies in which state farm has written that it promises to pay to repair or replace the property or part with like kind and quality.the court construes this language in the most favorable way possible for state farm,concluding ultimately that this is an unambiguous promise to restore the vehicle to its preloss term which appears nowhere in this form of the contract.
the court acknowledges see at.at,at plaintiffs argument that like kind and quality means of like kind and quality to oem parts.this interpretation is well supported by state farm own analysis of the standards required of parts,in gcm 
aftermarket parts must be of oem quality that quality must be guaranteed by the supplier 
salvage parts must be of equal,or better,quality compared to the parts being replaced.emphases in original.
i respectfully suggest that this ought to be the end of the matter.plaintiffs argue that like kind and quality means like kind and quality to oem parts state farm has admitted in its internal memoranda that this is precisely the quality standard it requires of parts case closed.
instead,the court once again ignores the memorandum by state farm vice president of claims and construes the language state farm drafted in state farm favor,even going so far as to draw inferences advantageous to state farm.see at.at,at.in so doing,the court abandons our rule that ambiguities in insurance contracts are to be strictly construed against the drafter.see travelers insurance eljer manufacturing,american states insurance koloms,outboard marine liberty mutual insurance.
the phrase like kind and quality is clearly ambiguous.the language itself gives no clue as to whether it means of like kind and quality to oem parts or to the part which existed on the vehicle immediately prior to the crash.but instead of construing this phrase against state farm,as mandated by our precedent,the court bends over backwards to find an interpretation that favors state farm.for instance,the court reasons that if parts never satisfied this promise as plaintiffs have alleged,there would be no need for this indirect phrasing.at.at,at.in other words,the court finds that the very vagueness of state farm contract of adhesion is a point in state farm favor.
moreover,the court misses the fundamentally obvious point that state farm and the plaintiffs disagreed as to whether parts were of like kind and quality to oem parts.state farm,of course,has maintained all along that parts are or can be of like kind and quality to oem parts.given this professed belief,there was no reason for state farm to restrict itself only to using oem parts.the proofs at trial,however,convinced the jury that this was not the case.essentially,the court is saying that state farm must not have promised that any parts it used would be of oem quality because the plaintiffs argued and proved that state farm never fulfilled this promise.this defies reason.we do not automatically adopt a defendant interpretation of a contract it drafted whenever a plaintiff proves a breach of its interpretation of the contract.to so suggest is absurd.
the court also draws inferences in favor of state farm from the sentence which follows the like kind and quality promise if the repair or replacement results in better than like kind and quality,you must pay for the amount of the betterment.clearly this statement by state farm in its contract of adhesion is meant to cover state farm in the unlikely event that a repair left the policyholder better off.but the court argues on state farm behalf that the very existence of this statement shows that like kind and quality can not mean like kind and quality to oem parts,because if it did,nothing could ever run afoul of the better than like kind and quality language.emphasis omitted.at.at,at.first,this reasoning is faulty in much the same way as the court reasoning regarding the you agree language state farm could just as easily have provided that if the repair or replacement results in your vehicle being able to fly to the moon,you must pay for the value of this ability.that state farm included language in a contract of adhesion does not constitute an admission by its policyholders regarding the hypothetical possibility against which state farm has sought to protect itself.
moreover,the proofs plaintiffs presented at trial concerned the quality of parts during the relevant period.plaintiffs claimed,and the jury concluded,based on documentary evidence and the testimony of experts whose bona fides state farm does not challenge on appeal,that parts were not the equal of oem parts.this does not foreclose the possibility that a master craftsman in zurich might in the future take it upon himself to smith a set of general motors crash parts out of titanium alloy,to such precise tolerances that the parts were indeed an improvement on oem parts.more realistically,it is possible that in the future a company could mass produce parts which are better than oem parts.it could happen.but according to the proofs plaintiffs presented at trial,and the verdict the jury returned in plaintiffs favor,it has not happened yet.state farm has protected itself against this eventuality by the sentence upon which the court relies.but there is no basis for the court broad inference from this sentence to support its interpretation of the baseline promise state farm has made in this version of the policy.
again,the flaw in the court reasoning is that it is taking into account plaintiffs theory of the case in evaluating state farm contractual promises.the court reasoning runs as follows if,as plaintiffs contend,no parts were of like kind and quality to oem parts,then there would have been no reason for state farm to draft the policy in the manner in which plaintiffs suggest they did.the problem with this reasoning is that it was very much in dispute whether parts were of like kind and quality to oem parts.state farm has consistently maintained and still maintains that they are or can be equivalent,and state farm drafted the policy.
moreover,as i have already observed,the court ultimately concludes that like kind and quality means something which is nowhere found in the language of this policy it means,just as state farm argues,sufficient to restore a vehicle to its condition.at.at,at.there are a number of difficulties with this conclusion.first,it contravenes the rule that ambiguous language in an insurance contract is to be strictly construed against the insurer.clearly the court finds the like kind and quality language ambiguous,given that the court ultimately finds that it has a meaning contained nowhere in the contract.given that it is ambiguous,there is no question that it ought to be construed against state farm.eljer manufacturing,at,koloms,at,outboard marine,at.
a second problem with the court conclusion is that in order to reach it,the court ignores state farm own admissions that parts must be of oem quality.the court willful blindness to gcm is truly troubling.it is,of course,possible for reasonable minds to differ as to the weight to accord a particular piece of evidence.but to act as though a document on the precise issue at hand,penned by state farm vice president of claims,does not even exist does a disservice not only to the parties but also to the credibility of this court.the court suggests that gcm is irrelevant because it is not contained within the four corners of the policy and the court has not explicitly found that the like kind and quality language is ambiguous.see at.at,at.this misses the mark.as i have already observed,the meaning the court ultimately ascribes to the phrase sufficient to restore a vehicle to its condition is itself not found within the four corners of the document.it can only further erode the public trust in the judiciary to reverse a verdict of this size,ignoring relevant evidence precisely on point,because the court claims it is,beyond any state farm promise to repair or replace the property or part with like kind and quality means with a part equally bad to whatever part was on the vehicle just before the accident and can not possibly mean like kind and quality to oem parts.there is no defensible basis for this conclusion and there is a host of evidence to the contrary,including not only porter testimony and the text of gcm,but also extensive testimony by state farm witnesses that repairs with parts would never compromise the safety of the vehicle.if state farm may utilize replacement parts no better than the parts which happened to be on the vehicle preaccident,however old or faulty,as the court concludes,a vehicle could very well have safety issues after repair.if the court is looking outside the document to understand the meaning of the phrase,and there is no question that it is,then the court is treating the phrase as ambiguous,regardless of whether my colleagues are forthright enough to so admit.
moreover,gcm itself shows that the court analysis of the contract is only is the phrase ambiguous,but the court has actually interpreted it incorrectly.gcm directly contradicts the court farm interpretation of the ambiguous phrase in state farm insurance policy.not only did the vice president of claims specify that aftermarket parts had to be of oem quality,he also specified that the lesser standard of equality to the parts being replaced,preloss a standard applicable only to salvage parts.how the court can square its interpretation of like kind and quality with this evidence is beyond me.apparently,given the court deafening silence on the matter,it is beyond the court as well.
the court errs in construing the ambiguous language like kind and quality in favor of state farm,in terms which appear only in other versions of the policy.doing so violates the rule that ambiguous terms in insurance policies are strictly construed against the drafter.indeed,three out of the four members of today majority have authored opinions which have explicitly endorsed this rule of construction of insurance contracts,and the fourth member has recently concurred in an opinion in which the rule was applied.see eljer manufacturing,at,justice mcmorrow,writing for the court,acknowledging that if the language of the policy is susceptible to more than one meaning,it is considered ambiguous and will be construed strictly against the insurer who drafted the policy and in favor of the insured central illinois light home insurance,justice garman,writing for the court,acknowledging that if the words used in the policy are reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning,they are ambiguous and will be strictly construed against the drafter gillen state farm mutual automobile insurance,justice fitzgerald,writing for a unanimous court,acknowledging that i f the policy language is susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning,it is considered ambiguous and will be construed against the insurer.this construction also contradicts the court own statements that there is nothing to support the conclusion that linguistic differences are irrelevant and that all of state farm policy variations therefore are susceptible of the same contractual interpretation at.at,at and that the like kind and quality policy form and the condition form are not the same.emphasis in original.at.at,at.the court also ignores state farm own interpretation of its obligations in gcm,a document by a state farm vice president which directly contradicts state farm position and the court conclusion regarding what is required of aftermarket parts.the court conclusion that in order to be like kind and quality,parts need merely to be sufficient to put the car in preloss condition erases the distinction drawn by state farm in gcm between parts and salvage parts.
because the reasoning regarding the like kind and quality form of contract is erroneous,there is no reason that plaintiffs could not recover under this form of the contract as well as the condition form of contract,as i previously demonstrated.
unlike my colleagues,i would construe the ambiguous terms in state farm policies against the drafter,in accordance with our unwavering precedent.see,eljer manufacturing,at,koloms,at,outboard marine,at.noting that state farm witness porter testified that state farm obligation was everywhere the same,and that state farm vice president of claims specified that parts must be of oem quality,as opposed to the lesser standard of equivalence to the parts being replaced,which applied only to salvage parts,i would affirm the conclusion of the circuit court and appellate court that state farm could only satisfy its obligations to its insureds with parts of equivalent quality to oem parts.
the court goes on to discuss the damages awarded on the breach of contract claim,even though doing so is not necessary to its decision.having already determined that the verdict form was faulty and there was in any event no breach of any of the underlying policies,the court decision to address damages is clearly dictum,even though the court labels its damages discussion an additional reason to reverse.as i stated at the outset,i agree with the court that there is no basis for the specification damages.no state farm policyholder was harmed by the isolated act of state farm specifying that their vehicle was to be repaired with a part.rather,only those policyholders whose vehicles were actually repaired with parts or who paid the difference to have oem parts installed can be said to have been harmed.
however,i do not agree with the court unwarranted attack on plaintiffs counsel for requesting specification damages.first,it is wholly irrelevant to the legal issues involved in this case why plaintiffs devised their theory in the first instance.at.at,at.the court answer to this question is nothing more than an attack on plaintiffs counsel as unintelligent and dishonest,in that order.the court reasons that counsel was,at first,ignorant that plaintiffs would have to establish damages without destroying commonality and,then,mendacious enough to deliberately invent a bogus category of damages in order to hoodwink the circuit court into maintaining this action as a class action when it should not have been.at.at,at.this vilification of plaintiffs counsel is wholly speculative and injudicious.
the court attack has the additional fault of being inaccurate.the court guesses that plaintiffs invented specification damages because without them,plaintiffs would have been unable to establish damages and still maintain the commonality required of a class action.at.at,at.and yet,the court does not hold that the other category of damages plaintiffs claimed,installation damages,destroyed commonality.in fact,the court admits that there is nothing wrong with us ing statistical inference in determining aggregate damages in a class action suit at.at,at,as plaintiffs did with respect to installation damages.the court here implicitly admits that plaintiffs could have established installation damages without destroying commonality the court simply holds that plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence to support their installation damage claim in this case,a conclusion with which i disagree,as i shall discuss.so the realization the court attributes to plaintiffs is entirely false.and thus the attack on plaintiffs counsel,along with the impugning of their integrity,unwarranted even if it were accurate,is as well.
with respect to installation damages,i would hold that plaintiffs did present sufficient evidence to uphold their installation damages claim.this court has stressed that the determination of the amount of damages is a function reserved to the trier of fact and that a reviewing court should not substitute its opinion for the judgment rendered in the trial court.richardson chapman.moreover,a court reviewing a jury assessment of damages should not interfere unless a proven element of damages was ignored,the verdict resulted from passion or prejudice,or the award bears no reasonable relationship to the loss suffered.snelson kamm.therefore,when the calculations and proportions of the award demonstrate a strong relation to the evidence presented,the jury determination can not be against the manifest weight of the evidence.see jones chicago osteopathic hospital,d,if a jury award falls within the flexible range of conclusions reasonably supported by the evidence,it must stand.emphasis added.snelson,at.these principles are nowhere acknowledged in today opinion.
the court damages discussion presents an anomaly in american jurisprudence,in that it would reverse a damage award for being too low.i know of no rule of law which would lead a court of review to conclude,as the court does today,that if the jury had given plaintiffs more than it believed the plaintiffs had proven they deserved,it would affirm,but because the jury was conservative and awarded a low amount,plaintiffs are entitled to no compensation at all.
in my view,the court appears to be punishing the conservatism of the jury damage award.mathur testified that damages could be as high as billion.he also testified that his estimate could be off by as much as billion.the jury obviously took mathur at his word.the jury accepted the top estimate mathur suggested,but reduced his highest estimate by the largest correction he endorsed.these calculations clearly demonstrate a strong relation to the evidence presented snelson,at,and thus are not against the manifest weight of the evidence.i decline to join the court suggestion that jury awards which bear a strong relation to the evidence presented might still be reversed for being too low,and i question the impact the court discussion will have on future damage awards in this state.and,again,it is worth recalling that the entire discussion here is dictum,as the court has already determined that the plaintiff class is entitled to no relief on other,independent grounds.the court decision to include this analysis can not be understood as anything but a decision to attack this particular jury verdict on every conceivable front.
disposition 
in light of the foregoing,i believe that the appropriate disposition with regard to the breach of contract claim is to remand the cause to the circuit court to determine whether there exists any subclass of the nationwide class with respect to which the verdict may be upheld.in contrast to my colleagues,i believe that the proper reason for reversing the nationwide class is the shutts problem there are differences between the laws of illinois and the laws of other states,and illinois has no compelling interest in applying its law to states whose laws differ.see supra,at.at,at freeman,concurring in part and dissenting in part,joined by kilbride.but the fact that there are outcome determinative differences between illinois and some other states does not mean that there are differences between illinois and all other states.thus,on remand,i would direct the circuit court to hold a hearing to determine which if any of the states that have been the subject of evidence in these proceedings is sufficiently closely aligned with illinois law that the use of illinois law to determine the contractual rights of state farm policyholders in that state would not offend state farm due process rights.such a result would be well within the circuit court inherent power to manage class actions.see ilcs a,b west.see also purcell wardrope,chartered hertz,d,a class action may,nevertheless,still be maintained,despite these conflicting or differing state laws,and the court may simply choose to divide the class into subclasses.moreover,if at some later time in the litigation,the subclassification becomes unmanageable,the court,of course,always has the option to set aside the class certification or a portion of it,quoting purcell wardrope,chartered hertz,d.assuming that all the requirements of a class action are satisfied with respect to such a subclass,the verdict could be affirmed with respect to that subclass,with damages equal to the pro rata portion of the nationwide installation damages attributable to the policyholders in those states.
notwithstanding the decertification of the entire nationwide class,a con
