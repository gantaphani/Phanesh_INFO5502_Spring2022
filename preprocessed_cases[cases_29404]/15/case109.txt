new york general business law section provides that n o seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash,check,or similar means.plaintiffs appellees in this action plaintiffs are five new york businesses and their owners and managers they sued the attorney general of the state of new york and the district attorneys of new york county and kings county collectively,new york in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,claiming that section violates the first amendment free speech clause and is void for vagueness under the fourteenth amendment due process clause.the district court jed rakoff,judge agreed with plaintiffs on both counts,and eventually entered a final judgment declaring section unconstitutional and permanently enjoining new york from enforcing the law against plaintiffs.on appeal,we conclude that section violates neither the first amendment nor the due process clause,and we therefore vacate the judgment entered by the district court and remand for dismissal of plaintiffs claims.
background 
swipe fees and credit card surcharges 
every time a consumer pays for goods or services with a credit card,the issuer charges the merchant a percentage of the purchase price.the parties and literature refer to these fees as swipe fees or fees.the typical fee is two to three percent of the transaction amount.plaintiffs and other businesses that chafe at these fees would like to pass them along to consumers while also making consumers aware of the charge in an effort to convince them to pay cash.accordingly,they would like to charge more than their regular price to customers who use credit cards that is,they would like to impose a surcharge on users.another way of passing the cost of credit along to customers is to offer a discount from the regular price to customers who use cash.while these two means of passing along the cost of credit may seem equivalent in that they both ultimately result in customers paying more than cash customers,differences between them have led to a series of efforts by both companies and legislators to prohibit surcharges specifically.
one difference between surcharges and cash discounts involves consumers reactions to them.a psychological phenomenon known as loss aversion means that changes that make things worse losses loom larger than improvements or gains of an equivalent amount.daniel kahneman et,anomalies the endowment effect,loss aversion,and status quo bias,econ.persp.for this reason,surcharges are more effective than cash discounts at discouraging use among consumers,which has naturally led companies to oppose them.see richard thaler,toward a positive theory of consumer choice,econ.behav.org.but some consumer advocates and lawmakers,too,have favored protecting consumers from the inconvenience and annoyance of having extra charges added to their bills,and have also suggested that discouraging use may have adverse economic effects on the broader economy by dampen ing retail sales.
according to proponents of prohibitions on surcharges,experience also suggests that such surcharges will tend to exceed the amount necessary for the seller to recoup its swipe fees,meaning that sellers will effectively be able to extract windfall profits from users by contrast,cash discounts are unlikely to lead to the same problem,because merchants will not set the amount of the discount higher than the marginal cost of credit.see,adam levitin,priceless the economic costs of credit card merchant restraints,ucla,m erchants ability to discount is limited by the spread between the credit price and the merchandise cost to the merchant.if the merchant offers discounts by more than that spread,the merchant will lose money on the transaction.merchants might need to increase the credit price to create a sufficient spread to profitably offer a discount that affects consumer behavior.further,because surcharges unlike cash discounts offer a means of increasing customers bills,dishonest sellers may attempt to profit at their customers expense by imposing surcharges surreptitiously at the point of sale.
b.the lapsed federal ban on credit card surcharges 
new york enacted section in.because the law enactment was motivated by the expiration of a federal law that prohibited surcharges,we briefly recount the history of that federal law.
in the early days of credit cards,issuers contracts with merchants prohibited merchants from charging different amounts to customers who used credit cards and those who used other methods of payment.in,however,congress amended the federal truth in lending act tila to protect merchants ability to offer their customers discounts for using cash.see fair credit billing act,tit.iii,stat.codified in relevant part at a providing that issuers could not prohibit seller s from offering a discount to a cardholder to induce the cardholder to pay by cash,check,or similar means rather than use a credit card.in the same amendments,congress also provided that these protected cash discounts did not rank as finance charges governed by tila disclosure requirements.id.in,the federal reserve board the fed promulgated a regulation clarifying that the statutory exemption from tila disclosure requirements did not also apply to surcharges.see fair credit billing,description of transactions.in,congress again amended tila to both ratify the fed interpretation and ban surcharges entirely.see an act to extend the state taxation of depositories act,stat.the amendments.specifically,the amendments provided n o seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a cardholder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash,check,or similar means.id.c.moreover,to clarify the distinction between protected discounts and newly unlawful surcharges,the amendments defined the term surcharge as any means of increasing the regular price to a cardholder which is not imposed upon customers paying by cash,check,or similar means defined the term discount as a reduction made from the regular price and clarified that a discount shall not mean a surcharge.id.a codified in relevant part at u.q,r.
the amendments ban on surcharges was initially set to expire in,but in,congress extended it until.see financial institutions regulatory interest rate control act,stat.in,congress extended the statute again,and apparently in response to the charge that the distinction between surcharges and cash discounts remained difficult to understand further clarified the matter by defining the term regular price as follows 
the tag or posted price charged for the property or service if a single price is tagged or posted,or the price charged for the property or service when payment is made by use of a credit card if either no price is tagged or posted,or two prices are tagged or posted,one of which is charged when payment is made by use of a credit card and the other when payment is made by use of cash,check,or similar means.
cash discount act,stat.codified in relevant part at y.
the enactment provided that the ban on surcharges would expire on february.id.the ban expired on that date,and congress did not renew it.the federal ban expiration motivated eleven states to enact their own laws prohibiting surcharges.new york was one of those states.
section enactment 
section,in its entirety,reads as follows 
no seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash,check,or similar means.
any seller who violates the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars or a term of imprisonment up to one year,or both.
bus.law thus,section operative language is essentially identical to that of the lapsed federal surcharge ban,but it does not incorporate its federal counterpart explicit definitions of surcharge,discount,and regular price.q,r,y.
when the bill proposing section was introduced in the new york legislature,the bill summary indicated that the law was necessary to take the place of the lapsed federal surcharge ban.it cited the risk that merchants would,at the time of the sale,raise or lower the price according to the method of payment,leaving the consumer subject to dubious marketing practices and variable purchase prices.it also clarified,however,that merchant s would be able to offer a discount for cash if they so desire.
advocacy groups were divided on the proposed bill.it was supported by the new york state consumer protection board,which explained that surcharges psychologically impose penalties on purchasers and may actually dampen retail sales,and also expressed the fear that permitting surcharges would undermine efforts to insure that customers can depend on advertised claims and prices by permitting unannounced price increases at the point of sale.however,the retail council of new york state opposed the bill,arguing that swipe fees required merchants to increase their prices,and that in the absence of surcharges,price increases would be spread across all customers,resulting in cash purchasers effectively subsidizing users purchases.ultimately,the new york senate passed section by a vote of to seven,and the assembly passed it unanimously.
section enforcement history 
although new york statutory ban on surcharges has been in effect for several decades,it was,for much of that time,effectively redundant with standard provisions in issuers contracts that prohibited sellers from imposing surcharges on customers although,as previously noted,tila guarantees sellers freedom to offer cash discounts as a result,there are almost no reported cases involving section application.
the parties have cited just one reported prosecution under section.in,eugene fulvio,a owner,was charged with an attempted violation of the statute.initially,a new york trial court rejected fulvio motion to dismiss on the ground that section was unconstitutionally vague on its face.see people fulvio,fulvio i holding that section by its terms gave the defendant fair warning as to what conduct was prohibited.after a subsequent bench trial,however,a different judge granted fulvio renewed motion to dismiss on the ground that section was void for vagueness as applied to him.see people fulvio,fulvio ii finding the law unconstitutional because it is not the act which is outlawed,but the word given that act.despite distinguishing fulvio i on the ground that it had involved a facial as opposed to an challenge,the court in fulvio ii did not actually resolve a factual dispute as to whether fulvio had posted separate cash and prices at his gas station as fulvio had testified at trial,or instead posted a single price and then imposed a surcharge for use as the complainant had testified.see id.at.
in addition to the fulvio prosecution,plaintiffs point to another,more recent spate of enforcement activity involving section.in,the new york state attorney general office announced that it had reached settlements with fourteen sellers in suffolk county who had been violating section.according to affidavits submitted by some of those sellers in this case,the sellers had communicated with their customers over the phone the sellers would tell customers the price of fuel for example,gallon and then explain that there was a surcharge on top of that price for paying with a credit card for example,gallon.the attorney general office told the sellers that these communications were illegal under section,but that the sellers could quote the price as gallon and then explain to customers that they would receive a gallon discount for paying with cash.
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed this action against new york in the southern district of new york on june.their july,amended complaint contains three claims all brought pursuant to,which allege,respectively,that section violates the first amendment guarantee,is void for vagueness under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,and is preempted by the sherman antitrust act.plaintiffs sought a declaration that section is both unconstitutional and preempted,as well as an injunction against its enforcement.in their amended complaint,plaintiffs allege that they would like to charge customers more than cash customers to account for the companies swipe fees.specifically,they would like to impose a surcharge,as opposed to offering a cash discount.according to the amended complaint,only one plaintiff currently charges different amounts for credit and cash purchases expressions hair design,a unisex hair salon in vestal,new york,alleges that its current policy is to charge two different prices,one for customers and one for cash customers.however,it claims to fear that describing this difference as a surcharge,or say ing that credit is extra or more,might violate section.
on june,plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction preventing defendants from enforcing section against them,and new york moved to dismiss on ripeness and standing grounds,as well as for failure to state a claim.in supplemental affidavits submitted along with their motion,two plaintiffs stephen milles,the vice president of five points academy,and linda fiacco,the of expressions hair design clarify the pricing schemes that they would like to use but which are or may be prohibited by section.milles avers that five points would like to impose an extra charge,or surcharge,for users and to display prominently the surcharge that the customer will incur.according to milles,i t is not our intention to display two separate prices for each good and service that we offer,but rather to display with roughly equal prominence a single set of prices and the credit card surcharge amount.along similar lines,fiacco avers that expressions hair design would like to charge customers three percent more than cash customers,and to display a sign that characterize s the price difference as a surcharge on top of the listed cash price without displaying the total price as a dollar figure.
on october,the district court issued an opinion granting plaintiffs preliminary injunction motion and denying new york motion to dismiss.expressions hair design schneiderman,d.the district court found that plaintiffs challenge was ripe because they were presently chilled from implementing their preferred pricing scheme,and that plaintiffs had standing based on a credible fear that section would be enforced against them.as for the first amendment,the district court concluded that section burdens speech by draw ing the line between prohibited surcharges and permissible discounts based on words and labels,rather than economic realities.id.at.applying the central hudson test for restrictions on commercial speech,the district court found section unconstitutional.see id.at.the district court also held that section was void for vagueness because it turns on the labels that sellers use to describe their prices.id.at.the court further held that plaintiffs had demonstrated the other elements necessary for a preliminary injunction,and therefore preliminarily enjoin ed the defendants from enforcing section during the pendency of this case.id.at.the district court also denied new york motion to dismiss plaintiffs preemption claim,though plaintiffs had not sought a preliminary injunction on that ground.
the parties stipulated to and the district court entered,on november,a final judgment on plaintiffs first and fourteenth amendment claims,even though their preemption claim was still pending.see.b t he court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.in the final judgment,the district court declare d that section violates the first amendment and is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,permanently enjoin ed the defendants from enforcing section against the plaintiffs,and dismissed plaintiffs preemption claim as moot,without prejudice.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
when reviewing an order granting either a preliminary or a permanent injunction,we review the district court legal holdings de novo and its ultimate decision for abuse of discretion.goldman,sachs golden empire sch.fin,cir.because we conclude that the district court erred in holding that section violates the first amendment and the due process clause,we vacate the judgment entered below and remand for dismissal.we begin with the first amendment.
some preliminary discussion is necessary to frame more precisely the scope of plaintiffs first amendment challenge.again,the statute provides that n o seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash,check,or similar means.bus.law.because the statute does not define the word surcharge,we give it its ordinary meaning.see fcc v.at t.a surcharge ordinarily means a charge in excess of the usual or normal amount an additional tax,cost,or impost.webster third new international dictionary see also black law dictionary ed defining surcharge as a n additional tax,charge,or cost duprey state of,dep t of motor vehicles,d,explaining that a fee is a surcharge if it is in excess of a usual or normal amount.accordingly,section use of the word surcharge assumes that a seller to which the statute applies will have a usual or normal price that serves as a baseline for determining whether customers are charged an additional amount that cash customers are not.
the parties agree that this baseline is not the ultimate price that the seller charges to cash customers,but rather is something different namely,the seller regular price.importantly,then,section does not prohibit all differentials between the price ultimately charged to cash customers and the price ultimately charged to customers it forbids charging customers an additional amount above the regular price that is not also charged to cash customers,but it permits offering cash customers a discount below the regular price that is not also offered to customers.that is,it allows what we have termed cash discounts.to illustrate,if a seller regular price is,it may not charge creditcard customers and cash customers,but if the seller regular price is,it may charge customers and cash customers.this distinction is consistent with the federal surcharge ban on which section was modeled,which defined surcharge as any means of increasing the regular price to a cardholder which is not imposed upon customers paying by cash,defined discount as a reduction made from the regular price,and clarified that a discount shall not mean a surcharge.q,r.
if a surcharge means an additional amount above the seller regular price,then it is basically how section applies to sellers who post single,readily ascertainable prices for their goods or services or what we will call sticker prices the sticker price is the regular price,so sellers may not charge customers an additional amount above the sticker price that is not also charged to cash customers.as plaintiffs point out,however,not all sellers post single sticker prices for their goods or services.the federal surcharge ban was eventually revised to account for this possibility by defining the term regular price so that the statute could never be violated unless the seller tagged or posted a single price.see y defining regular price,in relevant part,as the price charged when payment is made by credit card if either no price is tagged or posted,or two prices are tagged or posted,one of which is charged when payment is made by credit card and the other when payment is made by use of cash,check,or similar means.section,by contrast,does not explicitly use the term regular price,much less define it,nor does the law otherwise indicate whether or how it applies outside the context.this difference between section and the lapsed federal surcharge ban raises certain questions about the former law scope can a seller have a regular price if it does not post a single sticker price if so,what is it 
with this background in mind,we turn to plaintiffs challenge to section.plaintiffs submissions reveal that they are claiming first amendment protection for two distinct kinds of pricing schemes.first,plaintiffs aver that they would like to post only a single price for their goods and services and charge more than that price to customers,but are prohibited from doing so by section.see,five points academy it is not our intention to display two separate prices for each good and service that we offer,but rather to display with roughly equal prominence a single set of prices and the credit card surcharge amount.expressions hair design we would like to characterize the price difference as a surcharge on top of the listed cash price.in other words,plaintiffs are seeking first amendment protection for the kind of straightforward scheme that section clearly prohibits.second,expressions hair design the only plaintiff to do so currently posts two different prices for its services one for customers and one for cash customers and fears being prosecuted for characterizing this price differential as a surcharge,or for telling its customers that credit costs more.we will refer to this second pricing scheme as a scheme.
throughout the course of this litigation,plaintiffs have attempted to demonstrate section unconstitutionality by reference to other,hypothetical pricing schemes that they neither currently employ at their businesses nor claim they would employ but for section.assessing a statute constitutionality as applied to hypothetical situations not before the court,however,is appropriate only if the challenger is mounting a facial attack on the statute.see.state grange.state republican party,explaining that f acial challenges are disfavored in part because they run contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint that courts should neither anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of deciding it nor formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied quoting ashwander tva,brandeis,concurring.two kinds of facial challenges are available in the first amendment context a plaintiff can attempt to demonstrate either that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications,or that a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.id.at quoting new york ferber.in either case,where as here the plaintiff delineates the specific conduct for which it is claiming protection,assessing the challenged statute constitutionality as applied to that conduct is a critical first step.if that analysis shows that the plaintiff own conduct may lawfully be prohibited,then the statute is not unconstitutional in all of its applications.even in an overbreadth challenge,moreover,the supreme court has told courts not to consider whether a statute is substantially overbroad before it is determined that the statute would be valid as applied.bd.of trs.of state of fox.
plaintiffs do not clarify in their briefing whether they are,in fact,mounting a facial attack on section at oral argument,they suggested that their challenge is exclusively,but that characterization is in significant tension with their general failure to focus narrowly on the actual conduct in which they are engaged or would like to be engaged.ultimately,however,any uncertainty regarding the scope of plaintiffs first amendment challenge does not meaningfully affect our analysis.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that section does not violate the first amendment as applied to sellers.we further conclude that any challenge premised on section application outside the context whether facial or necessarily fails because section is readily susceptible to a construction under which its application is limited to that context.virginia am.booksellers ass n.the district court therefore erred in holding that section violates the first amendment.
as applied to schemes like the ones described in plaintiffs submissions,section does not violate the first amendment.restrictions on commercial speech are traditionally analyzed under the test established in central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york.plaintiffs argue,and the district court held,that section burdens commercial speech and does not survive central hudson.see expressions hair design,d at.on appeal,new york argues that section regulates conduct,not speech in the alternative,it maintains that the law survives central hudson because we agree with new york that section does not regulate speech as applied to sellers,we do not reach the parties arguments under central hudson.
we start from the premise conceded by plaintiffs that prices,although necessarily communicated through language,do not rank as speech within the meaning of the first amendment.this principle is illustrated most vividly by the fact that laws,which necessarily prevent sellers from communicating certain illegal prices,have never been thought to implicate the first amendment.see,munn illinois,otto,it has been customary in this country from its first colonization,to regulate ferries,common carriers,hackmen,bakers,millers,wharfingers,innkeepers,and in so doing to fix a maximum of charge to be made for services rendered,accommodations furnished,and articles sold.accordingly,although the supreme court has now repeatedly held that the advertising of lawful prices is protected by the first amendment,see,liquormart,rhode island,u,plurality opinion.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,it has reaffirmed in doing so that states may continue to make certain prices un lawful through direct regulation,liquormart,at plurality opinion accord id.at thomas,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment id.at,concurring in the judgment see ass of tobacco outlets,city of providence,cir in liquormart,rhode island,a majority of the justices,in striking down the categorical ban on liquor price advertising there,made clear that price regulations and other forms of direct economic regulation do not implicate first amendment concerns.citation omitted.
if prohibiting certain prices does not implicate the first amendment,it follows that prohibiting certain relationships between prices also does not implicate the first amendment.indeed,plaintiffs readily concede that new york could simply prohibit sellers from charging different amounts for and cash purchases altogether without thereby trigger ing first amendment scrutiny.appellees br.at.the problem with section,in plaintiffs view,lies in the undisputed fact that the statute forbids surcharges while simultaneously permitting cash discounts.because both surcharges and cash discounts ultimately amount to equivalent differences between the price charged to customers and the price charged to cash customers,plaintiffs argue that in the district court words section burdens protected expression by draw ing the line between prohibited surcharges and permissible discounts based on words and labels,rather than economic realities.expressions hair design,d at.we disagree.
by its terms,section does not prohibit sellers from referring to price differentials as surcharges,or from engaging in advocacy related to surcharges it simply prohibits imposing surcharges.see rumsfeld forum for acad.institutional rights,explaining that a statute regulates conduct,not speech,when it affects what regulated entities must do,not what they may or may not say.whether a seller is imposing a surcharge in other words,whether it is doing what the statute,by its plain terms,prohibits can be determined wholly without reference to the words that the seller uses to describe its pricing scheme.if the seller is charging customers an additional amount above its sticker price that it is not charging to cash customers,then the seller is imposing a forbidden surcharge.the only words and labels on which the operation of the statute thus depends are the seller sticker price and the price the seller charges to customers.but these two words and labels are merely prices.and,as we have explained and as plaintiffs themselves recognize,prices though necessarily communicated through language are not speech within the meaning of the first amendment,nor are they transformed into speech when considered in relation to one another.because all that section prohibits is a specific relationship between two prices,it does not regulate speech.
plaintiffs chief error or,perhaps more accurately,the central flaw in their argument is their bewildering persistence in equating the actual imposition of a surcharge,a seller choice to charge an additional amount above the sticker price to its customers with the words that speakers of english have chosen to describe that pricing scheme,the term surcharge.this is the only way to make sense of plaintiffs argument that w hat section regulates all that it regulates is what merchants may say characterizing the price difference as a cash discount is favored characterizing it as a credit surcharge is a crime.appellees br.at.but plaintiffs are simply wrong.what section regulates all that it regulates is the difference between a seller sticker price and the ultimate price that it charges to customers.a seller imposing a surcharge an additional amount above its sticker price on customers could choose to characterize that additional charge as whatever it wants,but that would not change the fact that it would be violating section.conversely,a seller offering a discount a reduction from its sticker price to cash customers could choose to characterize that reduction as whatever it wants including as a surcharge,but that would not change the fact that would not be violating section.of course,it is more likely that if a seller is imposing a surcharge,it will refer to its pricing scheme by its ordinary label surcharge while a seller offering a cash discount is likely to refer to its pricing scheme as a cash discount.but the fact that these pricing schemes have different labels and thus that sellers are likely to refer to them using different words obviously does not mean that all they are is labels.
in plaintiffs view,surcharges and cash discounts must just be labels because consumers react differently to them they react more negatively to surcharges than they react to cash discounts.thus,plaintiffs argue,new york has violated the first amendment by banning a label it disfavors surcharge while permitting a label it approves cash discount.this argument,however,plainly begs the question it assumes incorrectly that what new york has regulated are,in fact,labels.it is true,of course,that the government generally may not enact speech restrictions favoring one message over another.see reed town of gilbert,laws those that target speech based on its communicative content are presumptively unconstitutional and may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.but that first amendment principle is of no relevance whatsoever with respect to the threshold question whether the restriction at issue regulates speech or,instead,conduct in other words,as new york astutely observes,s peech is not the only cause of consumer unhappiness the mere fact that consumers react negatively to surcharges thus does not prove that surcharges are speech.appellants reply br.at.
in fact,consumers react negatively to surcharges not because surcharges communicate any particular message,but because consumers dislike being charged extra.see kahneman et,supra,at c hanges that make things worse losses loom larger than improvements or gains.if a consumer thinks,based on a seller sticker price,that she will be paying for the seller goods or services,then she will be annoyed if it turns out that she actually has to pay simply because she has chosen to use a credit card by contrast,if the sticker price is,she will be less annoyed by having to pay,even if cash customers only have to pay.nothing about the consumer reaction in either situation turns on any words uttered by the seller.and although the difference in the consumer reaction to the two pricing schemes may be puzzling purely as an economic matter,we are aware of no authority suggesting that the first amendment prevents states from protecting consumers against irrational psychological annoyances.
although the first amendment generally prevents the government from justifying a speech restriction by reference to the harmful reactions that the speech in question will cause among the reading or listening public,see,thompson states med,we have rejected the notion that the government has an interest in preventing the dissemination of truthful commercial information in order to prevent members of the public from making bad decisions with the information,there is nothing controversial about the government banning certain prices because of how consumers will react to them.the supreme court has said,for example,that states may enact laws for the express purpose of suppressing consumer demand.see liquormart,at plurality opinion it is perfectly obvious that alternative forms of regulation that would not involve any restriction on speech would be more likely to achieve the state goal of promoting temperance h igher prices can be maintained either by direct regulation or by increased taxation.accordingly,in national association of tobacco outlets city of providence,the first circuit held that the city of providence,rhode island could,consistent with the first amendment,prohibit discounts for tobacco products based on evidence that such discounts would lead to higher rates of tobacco use among young people.at quoting dep t of health human,preventing tobacco use among youth and young adults a report of the surgeon general.similarly,here,new york enacted section in part to prevent negative consumer reactions to surcharges in effect,spurring demand for use,instead of suppressing it.the first amendment poses no obstacle to such a law 
plaintiffs argument that section regulates how sellers communicate with their customers might also be understood as an argument that section regulates speech merely by forbidding sellers from setting their sticker prices lower than the prices that they ultimately charge to other words,that where a seller chooses to set its sticker price is a communicative act.thus,if a seller wants to charge customers and cash customers in order to pass along the companies swipe fees,the seller could if section were no obstacle either set its sticker price at and thereby communicate a surcharge or,presumably just as easily,set its sticker price at and thereby communicate a cash discount.this variation on plaintiffs argument,however,amounts to the position which we have already rejected and which plaintiffs concede is incorrect that prices are themselves speech.the fact that sellers can move their sticker prices up and down with relative ease and thus that sticker prices are,at least in some sense,not dictated by economic realities does not alter the fact that sticker prices,like any other prices,can be regulated without bringing the first amendment into play.
in concluding that sticker prices are not constitutionally exceptional,we again draw support from the first circuit decision in national association of tobacco outlets,which is both closely and persuasive.there,the first circuit rejected a first amendment challenge to an ordinance that among other things barred retailers from using coupons that provide any tobacco products without charge or for less than the listed or price,and from selling tobacco products through discounts.at.the plaintiffs argued that offering discounts to their customers was an inherently communicative act,but the first circuit disagreed,reasoning that the ordinance did not restrict retailers or anyone else from communicating pricing information concerning the lawful sale price of cigarettes,but rather restrict ed the ability of retailers to engage in certain pricing practices.id.at see also ass of tobacco outlets city of new york,d,relying on the first circuit decision to uphold a new york city law banning the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products below the listed price.thus,the fact that the tobacco sellers readily could have lowered their listed or price to the discounted price thereby resulting in their customers ultimately paying the exact same amount for tobacco products did not affect the fact that the ordinance regulated a pricing practice,not speech.here,too,the fact that a seller can simply raise its sticker price to the price thereby resulting in its customers ultimately paying the exact same amount as they would have if the seller had set a lower sticker price and imposed a surcharge does not affect the fact that section regulates a pricing practice,not speech 
in short,plaintiffs have provided no reason for us to conclude that section,which regulates the relationship between a seller sticker price and its price,differs in a constitutionally significant way from other laws that regulate prices and therefore do not implicate the first amendment.as applied to schemes like the ones described in plaintiffs submissions,section regulates conduct,not speech 
we note that under united states,laws that exclusively regulate conduct as section does may nonetheless implicate the first amendment in cases where the conduct at issue is inherently expressive.forum for acad.institutional rights,at.plaintiffs,however,adhering steadfastly to their argument that section regulates speech,have not asked us to assess section constitutionality under the supreme court precedents.see appellees br.at because the law regulates only speech,united states is irrelevant.we therefore decline to consider any such challenge.
we now turn to the balance of plaintiffs first amendment challenge,which is premised on the assumption that section applies to sellers who do not post single sticker prices.because this portion of plaintiffs challenge turns on an unsettled question of state law,we do not reach the merits.see comm of pullman,see also nicholson scoppetta,cir w e have an independent obligation to consider whether pullman abstention is appropriate.
two sets of arguments relevant here turn on the question whether section applies outside the context and,if so,to what extent.first,plaintiffs argue that section violates the first amendment as applied to expressions hair design scheme.under its scheme,expressions hair design charge s two different prices for haircuts and other lower price for customers paying with cash,check,or debit card and a higher price for customers paying with a credit card.expressions hair design allegedly fears that it will be prosecuted under section simply for characterizing that price difference as a surcharge or an extra charge for paying with a credit card,even though its customers do effectively pay more for using a credit card.see also.
second,plaintiffs posit a number of hypothetical pricing schemes that they do not actually employ or profess any desire to employ,but which,plaintiffs nonetheless suggest,deserve first amendment protection.to take some specific examples that have been discussed over the course of this litigation a seller might not post any prices at all,but ultimately charge customers more than cash customers to pass along the cost of the companies swipe fees.or the seller might post two sets of prices one for credit and one for cash but display the cash price more prominently to its customers.or the seller might advertise two prices with equal prominence per widget and per widget with surcharge.expressions hair design,d at.or it might attempt to comply with section by posting a single sticker price and then offering a cash discount,only to have its employees persistently tell customers that the discounted cash price is actually the regular price,and that using a costs more,or extra.other possibilities surely abound.in any event,because plaintiffs submissions in this case do not suggest that they will ever be engaged in this hypothetical conduct,we assume arguendo that their references to such conduct amount to a facial attack on section.of course,our conclusion that section is constitutional as applied to sellers means that the statute is not unconstitutional in all of its applications,so the only kind of facial challenge that remains available to plaintiffs is an overbreadth challenge.state grange,at.
the first amendment overbreadth doctrine permits a defendant to make a facial challenge to an overly broad statute restricting speech,even if he himself has engaged in speech that could be regulated under a more narrowly drawn statute.alexander united states.this doctrine responds to the concern that the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law may deter or chill constitutionally protected speech especially when the overbroad statute imposes criminal sanctions.virginia hicks.however,because there are obvious harmful effects to facially invalidating a law that in some of its applications is perfectly constitutional,courts vigorously enforce the requirement that a statute overbreadth be substantial,not only in an absolute sense,but also relative to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.united states williams,see,united states farhane,cir connection distrib.holder,cir en banc.
the primary problem with both plaintiffs challenge and their putative overbreadth challenge is that it is far from clear that section prohibits the relevant conduct in the first place.as noted earlier,the federal statute on which section was modeled was eventually revised to clarify that it did not,in fact,apply to sellers that did not post single sticker prices it defined regular price as the tag or posted price if a single price is tagged or posted,or the price when payment is made by use of a credit card if either no price is tagged or posted,or two prices are tagged or posted,one of which is charged when payment is made by use of a credit card and the other when payment is made by use of cash,check,or similar means.y.plaintiffs argument that section extends outside the context therefore depends on the assumption that section has a broader reach than the federal statute did.the parties,however,have not cited a single decision by a new york appellate court interpreting the scope of section prohibition.as we will explain,that dearth of authority dooms both of plaintiffs remaining challenges.
when anticipatory relief is sought in federal court against a state statute,respect for the place of the states in our federal system calls for close consideration of whether a ruling on the constitutionality of the state law is,in fact,necessary.arizonans for official english arizona.in particular,a body of law overlooked almost entirely by the parties and the district court in this case exists to avoid the error that can result when a federal court endeavors to construe a novel state act not yet reviewed by the state highest court.id.at see allstate ins.serio,cir where a decision is to be made on the basis of state law,the supreme court has long shown a strong preference that the controlling interpretation of the relevant statute be given by state,rather than federal,courts.the pathmarking precedent is pullman,in which the supreme court held that federal courts should abstain from decision when difficult and unsettled questions of state law must be resolved before a substantial federal constitutional question can be decided.right to life,sorrell,cir quoting all.of am.insurers cuomo,cir see pullman,at.after the federal court abstains,the parties may seek a controlling interpretation of the challenged law from the state courts,whose decision could cause the federal constitutional question to disappear altogether.accordingly,pullman abstention allows federal courts to avoid both a premature decisions on questions of federal constitutional law,and b erroneous rulings with respect to state law.serio,at.
the supreme court has long relied on the principles animating pullman in the context of first amendment overbreadth challenges.as noted,an overbreadth challenge can not succeed unless the challenged statute application to protected speech is substantial in comparison to its legitimate sweep.not infrequently,the substantiality vel non of a statute overbreadth will not be,and will instead depend on how the statute is interpreted.if a state statute is susceptible of multiple interpretations,one of which might render it overbroad and another of which would not,pullman logic suggests that the state courts if they have not definitively construed the statute already should be afforded the opportunity to adopt the narrower,less problematic interpretation.see tunick safir,cir opinion of calabresi,noting that state courts typically apply some version of the rule that a statute should be interpreted,if possible,so as to avoid constitutional doubts.thus,in dombrowski pfister,the supreme court indicated that a state statute with a potentially overbroad sweep should not be invalidated in its entirety if a readily apparent construction suggests itself under which the state courts could eliminate any constitutional difficulty.the court relied for this proposition on its earlier statement in baggett bullitt a pullman abstention case that abstention is appropriate if the challenged state law is susceptible to an interpretation that,if adopted by the state courts,would eliminate the constitutional issue and terminate the litigation,see dombrowski,at see also michael dorf,facial challenges to state and federal statutes,stan,w hen a federal court upholds a state statute against a facial challenge on the basis that the statute could be construed to avoid constitutional infirmities,the court,in effect,abstains from rendering a decision of state law pursuant to pullman.richard fallon,making sense of overbreadth,yale,similar.
the first amendment principle recognized in dombrowski that a state law should not be struck down as substantially overbroad if a readily apparent narrowing construction is available is not always explicitly acknowledged as an outgrowth of pullman abstention.nonetheless,federal courts have consistently reaffirmed that in considering an overbreadth challenge to a state statute,we must presume that the state courts will give the law a narrow construction so long as the law is readily susceptible to that construction.right to life,at quoting am.booksellers ass n,at see also,ferber,at rejecting an overbreadth challenge premised on the assum ption that the new york courts will widen the possibly invalid reach of the statute by giving an expansive construction to its proscription erznoznik city ofjacksonville,a state statute should not be deemed facially invalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts,and its deterrent effect on legitimate expression is both real and substantial.citation omitted broadrick oklahoma,u,facial overbreadth has not been invoked when a limiting construction has been or could be placed on the challenged statute.dorf,supra,at w hen the validity of a statutory provision turns on its applicability to persons not before the court,the court need not presume that a state court would construe the statute in an unconstitutional manner as applied to those persons.this presumption in favor of state laws constitutionality is consistent,moreover,with the supreme court emphasis on e xercising judicial restraint in facial challenge s in order to avoid premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy.state grange,at quoting united states raines.
applying the foregoing principles to the case at hand,we conclude that neither portion of plaintiffs first amendment challenge premised on section application outside the context can succeed.in light of the fact that section enactment was driven by the expiration of the federal surcharge ban,it is entirely possible,if not likely,that new york courts would construe section as being identical to the lapsed federal ban.certainly,we see nothing in section text that would foreclose such an interpretation although the law lacks the federal statute explicit definitions,the word surcharge itself,which means an additional amount above the seller regular or usual price,may necessarily signal that the law simply does not apply in the absence of a single sticker price.see fulvio i,at while the term surcharge is not precisely defined by the statute itself it retains its everyday,commonsense meaning footnote omitted.new york courts,moreover,like most state and federal courts around the country,will generally interpret statutes so as to avoid constitutional difficulties see all.of am.insurers chu,tunick,at opinion of calabresi.
we therefore conclude that section is readily susceptible.right to life,at,to a narrowing construction that would eliminate the constitutional issue and terminate this litigation,baggett,at.as a result,we can not presume that section has any applications outside the context at all that is,any applications other than the ones we have already found to be constitutional.to put this point more emphatically,we can not hold a duly enacted state law unconstitutional based entirely on speculation that the new york courts might give it an expansive and arguably problematic reading that its text does not require.this holding both defeats plaintiffs putative overbreadth challenge and on the other side of the same coin calls for abstention with respect to plaintiffs challenge.in other words,the fact that section is readily susceptible to the narrowing construction that new york has identified means that plaintiffs overbreadth challenge fails,because we must presume as a matter of law that new york state courts would adopt such a construction and the fact that the new york courts have not yet addressed this interpretive question means that we must abstain from deciding plaintiffs challenge.
the district court suggested that the actions of the new york prosecutors described above,by demonstrating that section has been enforced in accordance with a broad interpretation,were fatal to new york argument that section could be interpreted consistently with the lapsed federal ban.expressions hair design,d at.this was clear error.one reported prosecution and one set of threatened prosecutions by the state executive branch shed little light,if any,on how the new york court of appeals would construe section the state prosecutors could easily have been mistaken as to the law true breadth.see stenberg carhart,w e have never thought that the interpretation of those charged with prosecuting criminal statutes is entitled to deference.alteration in original quoting crandon united states,scalia,concurring in the judgment arizonans for official english,at noting the risk of federal courts premising their constitutional rulings on interpretations of state statutes not yet reviewed by the state highest court emphasis added.while the precedents cited by the district court as well as the linguistic differences between the texts make it arguable that new york courts could interpret the law to have a broader reach than the federal predecessor statute we decline to speculate as to which reading the state courts will adopt.
we also decline to certify to the new york court of appeals the question whether section applies to expressions hair design scheme we recognize that c ertification today covers territory once dominated by pullman abstention.arizonans for official english,at.whereas pullman abstention entail s a full round of litigation in the state court system before any resumption of proceedings in federal court,certification allows a federal court faced with a novel question to put the question directly to the state highest court,reducing the delay,cutting the cost,and increasing the assurance of gaining an authoritative response.id.at see also bellotti baird,osterweil,at.because of these advantages,this court has noted that it will generally be preferable to certify,rather than abstain,wherever it would serve the same purpose as pullman more efficiently.nicholson,at alteration in original quoting serio,at walker,concurring.still,certification is not obligatory even if available,and the decision whether to certify or abstain rests in the sound discretion of the federal court.lehman schein.
here,we believe that certification is not preferable,primarily because of the way in which this case has been litigated.were we to certify,plaintiffs challenge would be definitively resolved if the new york court of appeals were to interpret section consistently with the lapsed federal surcharge ban.but if the court of appeals were to give the statute a different construction,two key questions would remain whether the statute applies to expressions hair design specifically a question of state law that we would presumably ask the court of appeals to answer,and if so,whether that application violates the first amendment a question of federal law that we would answer.both questions would likely prove difficult in light of the present state of the record,since this case has been litigated almost entirely on the pleadings and the parties have focused their legal analysis primarily on section application to sellers.and,in determining whether a seller that posts separate cash and prices has actually been imposing a forbidden surcharge,a particularized understanding of how the seller displays its prices and communicates with customers would seem especially important.we will not burden the court of appeals with questions that potentially can not be answered without additional factual development scribner summers,cir w e would be inclined to certify the question to the new york court of appeals should the question be presented on an appropriate record.because additional development of the record would be necessary,moreover,one of the primary benefits that certification enjoys over pullman abstention eliminating the delay and cost of litigating anew in state court is not as weighty here.finally,we think there is a minimal risk that any first amendment rights expressions hair design may be exercising will be compromised by our decision to abstain.it has employed its scheme without being prosecuted thus far,and new york has,in this case,effectively disavowed any interpretation of section under which sellers will be prosecuted simply because their employees happen to refer to their pricing schemes as involving a surcharge.
in sum section does not violate the first amendment as applied to sellers.and,because it is unclear whether the law applies outside that specific context,there is no basis for us to conclude that the law violates the first amendment in any of its applications,much less on its face.as the foregoing discussion illustrates,federal courts can occasionally be an unwise choice of forum for plaintiffs seeking the invalidation of disfavored state laws.r espect for the place of the states in our federal system requires no less.arizonans for official english,at.
the district court also erred in holding that section is unconstitutionally vague under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.a law is void for vagueness if it either fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits or lacks explicit standards for those who apply it.vip of berlin,llc town of berlin,cir alteration in original quoting hill colorado,and thibodeau portuondo,cir a vagueness challenge may be either facial or.see farrell burke,cir.again,we construe plaintiffs submissions as raising a facial challenge to section,as well as an challenge concerning the statute application to two specific pricing schemes the scheme that plaintiffs say they would like to employ and the scheme employed by expressions hair design.these challenges fail for essentially the same reasons as plaintiffs first amendment challenges.
under traditional standards governing facial vagueness challenges,a law is facially unconstitutional only if it is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates.thus,if a statute has a core meaning that can reasonably be understood,then it may validly be applied to conduct within the core meaning,and the possibility of such a valid application necessarily means that the statute is not vague on its face.brache westchester county,cir see also cunney bd.of trs.of vill.of grand view,cir.
here,section plainly has a core meaning that can reasonably be understood sellers who post single sticker prices for their goods and services may not charge customers an additional amount above the sticker price that is not also charged to cash customers.in other words,section core meaning is identical to the scope of the lapsed federal surcharge ban.this conclusion follows directly from section use of the word surcharge,which means an additional charge above the usual price.we have complete c
