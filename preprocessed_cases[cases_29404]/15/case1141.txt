plaintiff,lucy mydlach,filed a complaint in the circuit court of cook county against defendant,daimlerchrysler corporation,alleging claims under the trade commission improvement act act or act et.the circuit court granted defendant motion for summary judgment,holding that the claims were under the statute of limitations contained in section of the uniform commercial ucc ilcs west.the appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part.d.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the appellate court and remand the matter to the circuit court for further proceedings.
background 
on june,plaintiff purchased a used dodge neon,manufactured by defendant,from mcgrath mcgrath in elgin,illinois.the vehicle was originally put into service on june,with a mile limited warranty.the warranty provided,in relevant part,as follows 
the basic warranty begins on your vehicle warranty start date which is the earlier of the date you take delivery of your new vehicle,or the date the vehicle was first put into service.
the basic warranty covers the cost of all parts and labor needed to repair any item on your vehicle except as noted below that defective in material,workmanship,or factory preparation.you pay nothing for these repairs.
the basic warranty covers every chrysler supplied part of your vehicle,except its tires and cellular telephone.
these warranty repairs or adjustments parts and labor will be made by your dealer at no charge using new or remanufactured parts.
the basic warranty lasts for months from the vehicle warranty start date or for miles on the odometer,whichever occurs first.emphasis in original.
at the time of plaintiff purchase in,the car mileage was.thus,the warranty had approximately one year or miles remaining.
beginning july,plaintiff brought the car to mcgrath and another authorized dealership several times for a variety of problems,including a recurring fluid leak.plaintiff claimed that the dealerships repair attempts were unsuccessful and,as a result,she could not use the vehicle as intended.plaintiff ultimately filed suit against defendant on may,seeking legal and equitable relief,as well as attorney fees and costs,under the act.plaintiff alleged breach of written warranty count i,breach of the implied warranty of merchantability count ii,and revocation of acceptance count iii.
the case initially proceeded to arbitration,where a decision was entered in favor of defendant.plaintiff rejected the arbitrators decision and the case was returned to the trial court.after further discovery,defendant filed a motion for summary judgment.defendant argued that counts i and ii of plaintiff complaint were subject to the statute of limitations found in section of the ucc ilcs west and that,as provided by section,the statute of limitations commenced upon tender of delivery of the vehicle to its original purchaser in june.thus,according to defendant,plaintiff suit,filed in may,was outside the limitations period.with respect to count iii,defendant argued that plaintiff was not entitled to seek revocation of acceptance because no privity existed between plaintiff and defendant,and because plaintiff could not prove the underlying breach of implied warranty claim.
plaintiff responded that her claims were not because the tender of delivery referenced in the ucc was the tender of delivery to her,and not to the original purchaser.plaintiff also argued that a lack of privity is not a bar to a claim for revocation of acceptance against a manufacturer who is also a warrantor.
relying on nowalski ford motor,d,the trial court agreed with defendant that plaintiff claims were and granted defendant motion for summary judgment on all three counts.the trial court denied plaintiff motion for reconsideration,and plaintiff appealed.
the appellate court reversed the trial court grant of summary judgment on counts i and iii,and affirmed the grant of summary judgment on count ii.as to the limitations issue,the appellate court followed cosman ford motor,d,rather than nowalski,and held that 
plaintiff right to bring a breach of written warranty action based on the promise to repair accrued when defendant allegedly failed to successfully repair her car after a reasonable number of attempts and that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until that time.d at.
the appellate court also held that plaintiff could properly pursue revocation of acceptance as an equitable remedy under the act if her breach of warranty claim was successful.d at.
we allowed defendant petition for leave to appeal.see.because plaintiff does not seek as to count ii of her complaint,the only counts before this court are counts i and iii.
the purpose of a summary judgment proceeding is not to try an issue of fact,but rather to determine whether one exists.ferguson mckenzie.summary judgment is thus appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.ilcs c west.because summary judgment is a drastic measure,it should only be allowed when the right of the moving party is clear and free from doubt.purtill hess.in an appeal from the grant of summary judgment our review proceeds de novo.morris margulis.in assessing whether summary judgment was appropriate here,we must determine when the limitations period,applicable to a breach of warranty claim under the act,commences.on this legal issue our review also proceeds de novo.see belleville toyota,toyota motor sales.
as an initial matter we address defendant argument that the act does not apply to limited warranties like the one at issue here.
the act,enacted by congress in,is a remedial statute designed to protect consumers from deceptive warranty practices.skelton general motors,cir.the act does not require a consumer product to be warranted.see b prohibiting the federal trade commission ftc from requiring that a consumer product or any of its components be warranted.where a warranty is provided,however,the warranty is subject to the act regulatory scheme skelton,at,including rules promulgated by the ftc a et.
the act speaks to both implied warranties and written warranties.an implied warranty means an implied warranty arising under state law,as modified by the act.as already noted,plaintiff implied warranty claim is not before this court.
the act defines a written warranty as 
a any written affirmation of fact or written promise made in connection with the sale of a consumer product by a supplier to a buyer which relates to the nature of the material or workmanship and affirms or promises that such material or workmanship is defect free or will meet a specified level of performance over a specified period of time,or 
b any undertaking in writing in connection with the sale by a supplier of a consumer product to refund,repair,replace,or take other remedial action with respect to such product in the event that such product fails to meet the specifications set forth in the undertaking.
the parties are in agreement that the warranty at issue here constitutes a written warranty for purposes of the act.case law on this subject is in accord,cosman,d at,a warranty under the act includes promises to repair products in the future whose inherent reliability is not warranted and includes mile repair or replacement warranty pierce catalina yachts,alaska concluding that limited repair warranty falls within the definition of a written warranty under section b of the act nationwide insurance general motors,noting that mile repair warranty fit s within the modern concept of warranty,citing section b of the act see also reitz,manufacturers warranties of consumer goods,the warranty act key concept,called a written warranty,is defined primarily as a promise to repair or replace goods,citing section b of the act.
the act also distinguishes between full and limited warranties,and sets forth minimum standards for full warranties.if a written warranty meets the federal minimum standards,then it shall be conspicuously designated a full statement of duration warranty.a.if a warranty does not meet the federal minimum standards,then it shall be conspicuously designated a limited warranty.a.the parties agree that the warranty at issue here is a limited warranty,as opposed to a full warranty.we note that defendant warranty booklet for the dodge neon repeatedly refers to defendant warranties as limited warranties.
to enforce its provisions,the act authorizes suits by the attorney general and the ftc to enjoin any warrantor from making a deceptive warranty or to enjoin any person from failing to comply with any requirement or from violating any prohibition contained in the act.c.significantly,the act also provides a statutory private right of action.borowiec gateway,accord skelton,at davis southern energy homes,cir milicevic fletcher jones imports,cir.
section d states in relevant part 
a consumer who is damaged by the failure of a supplier,warrantor,or service contractor to comply with any obligation under this chapter,or under a written warranty,implied warranty,or service contract,may bring suit for damages and other legal and equitable relief 
a in any court of competent jurisdiction in any state or the district of columbia or 
b in an appropriate district court of the united states.d.
the term consumer is broadly defined under the act as 
a buyer other than for purposes of resale of any consumer product,any person to whom such product is transferred during the duration of an implied or written warranty or service contract applicable to the product,and any other person who is entitled by the terms of such warranty or service contract or under applicable state law to enforce against the warrantor or service contractor the obligations of the warranty or service contract.
a supplier means any person engaged in the business of making a consumer product directly or indirectly available to consumers.a warrantor means any supplier or other person who gives or offers to give a written warranty or who is or may be obligated under an implied warranty.no dispute exists that plaintiff is a consumer within the meaning of the act or that defendant is a warrantor under the act.
a consumer who prevails in any action brought under section d may be allowed by the court to recover costs and expenses,including attorney fees.d.plaintiff complaint was filed under section d of the act.
defendant argument that the act does not apply to limited warranties is not entirely clear.as noted above,defendant does not dispute that its warranty constitutes a limited warranty,as defined by the act.additionally,defendant does not argue that plaintiff is precluded from bringing a breach of warranty claim under the act.indeed,defendant motion for summary judgment assumes that a cause of action has been stated.delgatto brandon associates,quoting janes first federal savings loan ass of berwyn.moreover,as set forth above,the remedies provision of section of the act brings within its reach the failure of a warrantor to comply with any obligation under a written warranty.d.section does not distinguish between a full warranty and a limited warranty.
defendant makes the related argument that the act is merely a conduit to apply state law remedies.this is the same argument defendant raised in cogley daimlerchrysler,d,where the appellate court considered the same issue that is before us today.the appellate court rejected defendant argument,stating 
according to defendants,in cases arising under limited warranties,the act serves only as a conduit for claims arising under state law.even if this statement is true,we fail to see how it has any bearing on the question of when the statute of limitations begins to run.as seen,all of the relevant illinois decisions are in agreement that the act borrows the ucc statute of limitations.this would appear to be true whether state law or federal law governs the substance of the claim.in other words,for statute of limitations purposes,it should make no difference whether the act provides the substantive law or merely serves as a conduit for a state law claim.emphasis added.cogley,d at.
we agree with the appellate court.whether state law will ultimately determine if a breach of limited warranty occurred here is irrelevant to the limitations issue this case presents.accordingly,we need not consider defendant conduit argument further and,instead,focus on the limitations issue.
although the act provides a private right of action for breach of a written warranty,the act does not contain a limitations provision for such an action.where a federal statute fails to specify a limitations period for suits under it,courts apply the most closely analogous statute of limitations under state law.delcostello international brotherhood of teamsters,d,accord wilson garcia,d,teamsters employers welfare trust gorman brothers ready mix,cir.in suits brought under the act,our appellate court,as well as courts in other jurisdictions,generally consider the ucc to be the most closely analogous statute and have borrowed the limitations provision contained therein.see,nowalski,d at,collecting illinois cases hillery georgie boy manufacturing,d,poli daimlerchrysler,murungi mercedes benz credit,d,keller volkswagen,pa super.we agree with the foregoing authorities and will look to the limitations provision contained in the ucc to determine the timeliness of plaintiff complaint.specifically,we will look to article of the ucc,which applies to transactions in goods.ilcs west.
section of the ucc,titled statute of limitations in contracts for sale,generally provides a limitations period 
an action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within years after the cause of action has accrued.by the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it.
a cause of action accrues when the breach occurs,regardless of the aggrieved party lack of knowledge of the breach.a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made,except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.ilcs west.
preliminarily,we note that the exception to the limitations period,set forth in subsection above,is not at issue in this case.as will be discussed in greater detail below,a repair or replacement warranty like the one issued by defendant here has nothing to do with the inherent quality of the goods or their future performance.cosman,d at.see also reitz,manufacturers warranties of consumer goods,promises to repair or replace refer to future performance of sellers,not to future performance of goods lawrence,lawrence anderson on the uniform commercial code,at ed discussing difference between a warranty of future performance and a covenant to repair or replace.accordingly,we turn our attention to the balance of the statute and the parties arguments relative thereto.
defendant argues that section should be applied as written.thus,because the statute provides that a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made,and tender of delivery of the dodge neon was first made in june,plaintiff suit,filed in may,was untimely.see nowalski,d at,holding that cause of action for breach of mile limited warranty accrued when the vehicle was delivered and not when defendant failed to successfully repair the vehicle.plaintiff argues that a repair warranty can not be breached until the manufacturer fails to repair the vehicle after a reasonable opportunity to do so,and that the appellate court did not err in finding her complaint was timely filed.see cosman,d at,holding that breach of mile limited warranty can not occur until ford refuses or fails to repair the powertrain if and when it breaks belfour schaumburg auto,d,following cosman and holding that breach of mile repair warranty can not occur until audi refuses or fails to repair the defect cogley,d at,following cosman and holding that suit for breach of mile repair warranty filed within four years of repair attempt was timely 
we begin our analysis by turning to the language of article of the ucc.section plainly states that a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made.ilcs west.the nowalski opinion,on which defendant relies,concluded that once article of the ucc is chosen as the analogous state statute from which to borrow the statute of limitations,the analysis begins and ends with the tender of delivery language quoted above.nowalski,d at.we disagree.
although courts generally consider article of the ucc to be the statute most closely analogous to the act,the two enactments are not identical.for example,article addresses warranties that are created by the seller.see ilcs,west.the act,however,addresses warranties from a supplier or warrantor who may or may not be the immediate seller.see.in addition,the term warranty,as used in the two enactments,is not the same.as discussed above,the act speaks of implied warranties and written warranties,the latter of which may be either full or limited.in contrast,the ucc speaks of express warranties which may be oral or written,implied warranties,and warranty of title.ilcs,west.
although the parties agree that defendant warranty is a written warranty under the act,they disagree as to whether the warranty is an express warranty under the ucc.defendant argues that the repair warranty qualifies as an express warranty and that plaintiff claim is therefore governed by the rule in section.plaintiff argues that it does not qualify as an express warranty and that her claim is not subject to the rule.
section of the ucc explains how express warranties are created.
express warranties by the seller are created as follows 
a any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.
b any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.
c any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.ilcs west.
the ucc makes plain that an express warranty is related to the quality or description of the goods.see moorman manufacturing national tank,observing that ucc warranty rules determine the quality of the product the manufacturer promises and thereby determine the quality he must deliver alloway general marine industries,stating that the provides for express warranties regarding the quality of goods credit herbolt,ohio app d,obr,identifying ucc express warranties as one of the warranties of quality hawkland,uniform commercial code series,at express warranties relate exclusively to quality,description and title of the goods and have nothing to do with the other terms of the contract.
in other words,an express warranty,for purposes of the ucc,obligates the seller to deliver goods that conform to the affirmation,promise,description,sample or model.if a seller delivers conforming goods,the warranty is satisfied.if the seller delivers nonconforming goods,the warranty is breached at that time.even if the buyer is unaware that the goods,as delivered,do not conform to the seller affirmation,promise,description,sample or model,the warranty has been breached.under this scenario,the statutory pronouncement that a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made ilcs west makes perfect sense,and the limitations period commences at that time.see klinger,the concept of warranty duration a tangled web,dick,section presumes that all warranties,expressed or implied,relate only to the condition of the goods at the time of sale and a s a result,the period of limitations begins to run at that time garvin,uncertainty and error in the law of sales the article two statute of limitations,article two defines a range of express and implied warranties which a ll go to the quality of the goods at tender.
the warranty in the present case,however,is not related to the quality or description of the goods at tender.it does not warrant that the vehicle will conform to some affirmation,promise,description,sample or model.rather,the warranty promises only that the manufacturer will repair or replace defective parts during the warranty period.as defendant made clear in its brief before this court 
daimlerchrysler limited warranty was not a promise that the vehicle would be defect free and in the event of a breach of warranty,plaintiff would be limited to repair or replacement of the vehicle.rather,daimlerchrysler limited warranty promised to cover the cost to repair or replace defective parts in the automobile for the time period covering months or thousand miles.
although defendant warranty qualifies as a written warranty under the act,it is not an express warranty under the ucc,and is thus not the type of warranty that can be breached on tender of delivery ilcs west.see cogley,d at,cosman,d at,dewitt,note,action accrual date for written warranties to repair date of delivery or date of failure to repair.reform,promise to repair relates not to the goods and their quality,but to the manufacturer and its obligation to the purchaser,and thus a repair warranty falls beyond the scope of the rule reitz,manufacturers warranties of consumer goods,date for commencement of ucc limitations provision is completely inappropriate to promises to repair or replace goods that are later determined to be defective.accordingly,we reject defendant argument that the limitations period for breach of the repair warranty commenced upon delivery of the dodge neon in,and we overrule the nowalski opinion on which defendant relies.
our conclusion that the repair warranty is not a ucc express warranty,and thus not subject to the rule set forth in the second sentence of section,does not render section irrelevant for purposes of determining when the limitations period began on plaintiff claim under the act.the first sentence of section remains applicable.the first sentence states a cause of action accrues when the breach occurs,regardless of the aggrieved party lack of knowledge of the breach.emphasis added.ilcs west.although the ucc does not expressly state when the breach of a repair promise occurs,we may refer to the law that exists outside of the ucc.see ilcs west unless displaced by the particular provisions of this act,the principles of law and equity shall supplement its provisions lawrence,lawrence anderson on the uniform commercial code,at ed because the ucc provides no assistance as to when a nonwarranty breach of contract occurs for purposes of computing the limitations period,it is necessary to resort to the general law of contracts,which has not been displaced by the code and therefore continues in force.
generally,w hen performance of a duty under a contract is due any is a breach.restatement second of contracts,at.performance under a vehicle manufacturer promise to repair or replace defective parts is due not at tender of delivery,but only when,and if,a covered defect arises and repairs are required.in that event,if the promised repairs are refused or unsuccessful,the repair warranty is breached and the cause of action accrues,triggering the limitations period.see cosman,d at,holding that breach of mile limited warranty can not occur until ford refuses or fails to repair the powertrain if and when it breaks belfour,d at,holding that breach of mile repair warranty can not occur until audi refuses or fails to repair the defect cogley,d at,holding that suit for breach of mile repair warranty filed within four years of repair attempt was timely.see also monticello winnebago industries,d,under georgia law,a written warranty that provides for repair or replacement of parts is breached when the purchaser returns the product to the dealer for repair and repair is refused or unsuccessful poli.at,at under new jersey law,cause of action for breach of mile warranty would not have accrued when the car was delivered,but rather when persistent problems appeared or when daimlerchrysler was unable to repair the defect long island lighting imo industries,cir under new york law,cause of action for breach of a repair promise accrued when the generator malfunctioned and the seller refused to make the necessary repairs.
this is the approach advocated by some commentators.for example,in his discussion of the appropriate treatment of a manufacturer express warranty to repair or replace defective parts,professor lawrence states 
the sounder approach is to recognize that the failure to repair or replace is merely a breach of contract and not a breach of warranty,and therefore no cause of action arises until the seller has refused to repair or replace the goods.this is because until the seller has failed or refused to make the repairs or provide a replacement,the buyer,not being entitled to such a remedy,has no right to commence an action for damages.as a result,the action is timely if brought within four years of the seller failure or refusal.lawrence,lawrence anderson on the uniform commercial code,at ed.
accord garvin,uncertainty and error in the law of sales the article two statute of limitations.
the correctness of this approach is manifest when we consider consumer claims for breach of repair warranties that run for periods longer than the three miles at issue here.for example,consider the case of a consumer who purchases a vehicle carrying a mile repair warranty.if the limitations period commences at tender of delivery,the limitations period for a breach of the repair promise occurring in year five will expire before the breach even occurs,thus rendering the repair warranty unenforceable during its final year.statutes of limitations,however,are intended to prevent stale claims,not to preclude claims before they are ripe for adjudication.guzman epperson construction.even a warranty could be rendered unenforceable if breach of the repair promise occurred near the end of the warranty period.in that case,the buyer would have only the briefest of periods in which to file suit.see nationwide insurance,at,at.
defendant argues that concerns about the enforceability of repair warranties are inapplicable to the facts of this case and without merit.we disagree.although the repair warranty at issue here ran for three years,our holding in this case will apply equally to warranties.such warranties are common in the automobile industry.adoption of defendant position would be an invitation to manufacturers and sellers of automobiles,as well as other goods,to engage in misleading marketing.that is,a manufacturer or seller could use the marketing advantage of a longer repair warranty,yet escape the accompanying obligations of that warranty by pleading the statute of limitations in defense.williams,the statute of limitations,prospective warranties,and problems of interpretation in article two of the ucc,geo.such a result is contrary to the very purpose of the act to improve the adequacy of information available to consumers and prevent deception.a.
defendant also argues that unless the rule in section is given effect,the limitations period for breach of limited warranty actions will be limitless and uncertain.this argument is without merit.because the promise to repair or replace defective parts is only good during the warranty period,the latest a breach of warranty can occur is at the very end of that period.accordingly,the statute of limitations will expire,at the latest,four years after the warranty period has run.if breach of a repair warranty occurs earlier in the warranty period,the limitations period for that breach will expire sooner,but in no event will the warrantor exposure extend beyond the warranty period,plus four years.thus,contrary to defendant argument,commencing the limitations period from the date the warrantor fails or refuses to repair the vehicle does not result in a limitless limitations period.
we recognize,of course,that a fact question may arise as to the date on which a repair warranty was breached which,in turn,would create some uncertainty as to when the limitations period should commence.fact questions of this nature,however,frequently arise in cases where the statute of limitations has been pled in defense.resolution of this type of uncertainty is a classic function of the trier of fact.see,county of du page graham,anderson,probst white,remanding the matter to the circuit court for a factual determination as to when the statute of limitations began to run against the county on its claims for defective design and construction of the county administration building knox college celotex,holding that trier of fact must determine when the plaintiff had sufficient information as to the roof defect to start the running of the limitations period witherell weimer,in many,if not most,cases the time at which an injured party knows or reasonably should have known both of his injury and that it was wrongfully caused will be a disputed question to be resolved by the finder of fact.we therefore reject defendant argument that commencing the limitations period when the warrantor fails or refuses to repair the than at tender of create unacceptable uncertainty in the limitations period.
turning to the facts of this case,the record indicates that plaintiff brought her vehicle to mcgrath and another authorized dealer on several occasions beginning in july.at that point,assuming the alleged defects were covered defects,defendant was obligated through its authorized dealer to make good on its repair promise.plaintiff lawsuit,filed in may,is therefore timely.accordingly,we affirm that portion of the judgment of the appellate court which reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant as to count i of the complaint.
defendant next argues that plaintiff can not seek revocation of acceptance count iii of the complaint if the underlying breach of warranty claim is.because we have already held that plaintiff breach of warranty claim was timely filed,we necessarily reject defendant argument.defendant further argues,however,that plaintiff is not entitled to revocation of acceptance because no privity of contract exists between the parties,and the relief sought by unwinding of the sales nonsensical against a manufacturer who is not a party to the sales transaction.plaintiff responds that revocation is an equitable form of relief available under section d of the act and that the existence of a manufacturer written warranty creates sufficient privity to seek revocation against the manufacturer.
section d of the act states that a consumer who is damaged by the failure of a supplier,warrantor,or service contractor to comply with any obligation under a written warranty may bring suit for damages and other legal and equitable relief.emphasis added.d.revocation of acceptance is a form of equitable relief.see mrugala fairfield ford,d.whether this form of relief should be available against a nonselling manufacturer is an issue on which illinois state courts have not spoken.courts in our sister states are divided.compare,hardy winnebago industries,and conte dwan,where the maryland and connecticut courts held that the remedy of revocation is only available against a seller of goods,with ventura ford motor,and volkswagen of america,novak,so d,where the new jersey and mississippi courts allowed revocation of acceptance against the remote manufacturer.
we note that federal courts sitting in illinois that have considered this issue have also reached contrary results.compare larry soldinger associates,aston martin lagonda of north america,c,wl.september,holding that the plaintiff could pursue revocation against the defendant manufacturer based on breach of the written warranty,with kutzler thor industries,c,wl.july,rejecting soldinger and holding that revocation of acceptance is unavailable against a manufacturer who is not a party to the sales contract.the appellate court in the present case followed the soldinger line of cases.d at.after carefully considering the matter,we find kutzler to be more persuasive,and thus reverse the appellate court judgment as to count iii of the complaint.
in kutzler,the plaintiff asserted a claim for revocation of acceptance under section d of the act based on an alleged breach of a written
