sometime in the late,robert carrau purchased over windows from marvin lumber and cedar company marvin,a window manufacturer,which were incorporated into a residence carrau built for himself and his wife in orinda,california.the windows proved to be defective,and,on october,carrau filed suit against marvin,seeking damages on the theories,as relevant here,of products liability,breach of express and implied warranties and violation of the consumer warranty act,civil code sections et hereafter,the act.
the trial court granted summary adjudication to marvin on carrau theory of breach of implied warranty,finding carrau claims under that theory to be.the remaining claims were tried to a jury,which returned a verdict in favor of carrau on his claim of breach of express warranty,awarding him,and on his claim of strict products liability,awarding him.the jury,however,returned a defense verdict on carrau claim of breach of the act.
marvin appeals from the order of the trial court denying marvin motion for a new trial or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,contending that the evidence does not support the verdict,and that carrau claim of breach of express warranty was.we agree,and will reverse the judgment.carrau,contending that the jury was prejudicially misinstructed on the act.although we find error in the instructions,we further find that carrau waived the point by failing to submit qualifying instructions,and that in all events any claim he might have had under the act also was.
after purchasing a parcel of property in orinda in the late,carrau and his wife designed and built a residence described by carrau as the culmination of all his work.the residence,which included over windows supplied by marvin,was completed in late.it is undisputed that the windows had been treated with an ineffective preservative,with the result that they were subject to premature rotting.
carrau first noticed a problem with the windows in or,when he found it necessary to replace the sill on one window and learned that a second window was leaking.there was evidence that the leaking caused some interior sheet rock to become wet and may have caused a stain on a carpet.carrau repaired the window,and replaced some wallpaper that had been damaged by the leaking.there was evidence that carrau also had to replace some exterior stucco.
carrau did not at that time attribute the leaking and related problems to a defect in the windows.sometime later,however,he learned that there was rot on the sash or frame of yet another window.at that point,carrau contacted marvin,which sent out a representative to survey all the windows.following the survey,marvin sent carrau a letter,dated june,proposing to replace of the windows,and asking carrau to obtain bids for the work.carrau obtained two bids,for and,respectively,which included not only replacement of the windows themselves,but such things as landscaping removal and restoration,replastering,restoring interior faux painting finishes that would be damaged by the repairs,replacing moldings and replacing security systems.the bids were sent to marvin,which responded by sending out its own contractor,who submitted a bid for,not including items such as removal and restoration of landscaping,that had been included in the bids obtained by carrau.carrau was not satisfied with the credentials of marvin contractor,and refused to permit that contractor to do the work unless marvin agreed to guarantee that the residence would be perfectly restored.
in the meantime,marvin had constructed and shipped the windows.by this time,however,carrau noticed that some additional windows,not covered by marvin proposal,were showing signs of deterioration.carrau therefore sought bids to replace all of the windows.the two contractors originally contacted by him submitted bids for and,respectively.a third contractor bid for the replacement of the original windows,plus for the remaining windows.
marvin refused to pay in accordance with the estimates obtained by carrau,and refused to guarantee that the work,if done by its own contractor,would restore the residence to a perfect condition.marvin did,however,fabricate and deliver windows to replace all of carrau windows 
carrau never actually replaced the windows.he put the house on the market in.a residential real estate appraiser specializing in unusual and properties such as carrau home,stated her opinion that the property,in an undamaged condition,would have sold for as much as million.carrau listed it at million.he ultimately sold the residence,however,for,and as a part of that sale,further agreed to credit the purchasers with to cover the costs of installing the replacement windows.
the purchasers replaced only four of the windows and ten sills.their contractor dug out any rot discovered on the remaining windows and put in an epoxy product.he then installed a molding assembly over the windows,which enabled him to do the repairs and replacements without disturbing the interior finishes,the exterior stucco or much of the landscaping.the contractor retextured some sheet rock and treated the windows as necessary with pentachloride,a wood preservative.the repairs cost approximately.there was evidence that of this price,the cost of the repairs to property other than to the windows themselves,such as the damage to the sheet rock,was in the neighborhood of a couple of hundred dollars.
the appeal 
of warranty 
the jury awarded carrau for breach of an express warranty,apparently concluding,that except for the damage to property other than the windows themselves,marvin satisfied its warranty obligations by delivering the replacement windows.marvin contends here,as it contended in moving for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,that the jury finding of breach of warranty is not supported by substantial evidence.marvin further contends that even if there is some evidence of breach of warranty,carrau suit on that theory was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.we agree.
carrau did not produce any express warranty that accompanied the sale of the windows.it was,however,established that at all relevant times,marvin sold its windows with a limited warranty for millwork,and there was evidence that the windows at issue here were delivered with some kind of a warranty and had some type of quality assurance labels it is undisputed that no defect in the windows was discovered or reported until over one year had passed from the date of purchase.the standard limited warranty,therefore,provides no support for the jury verdict.
carrau theorized,however,that it could be inferred that marvin had provided carrau with an express warranty guaranteeing that the windows would be free from defect for a period of years.in support of this theory,carrau produced evidence of a letter written to a homeowner by a customer service representative employed by marvin,indicating that the company that provided the product used on the homeowner windows gives the finish for a life expectancy.a second letter,written to another homeowner,indicated that marvin would write a warranty for a job with a minimum of windows carrau asserted that it was likely that marvin had provided him,as a purchaser of more than windows,with a warranty.carrau pointed out that marvin had not produced the exact warranty provided to carrau,arguing that it could be inferred that marvin had provided carrau with a favorable warranty,which was then conveniently lost.finally,carrau pointed out that after he complained,marvin offered to replace the windows,which action,according to carrau,indicated an understanding that the windows were still under warranty although the period in the standard warranty long had passed.
marvin responded by asserting that it offered to replace the windows not because it had a legal obligation to do so,but as a courtesy to carrau.when asked about the letters produced by carrau,a had worked for many years as a customer service representative with that marvin might,at the time of sale,enter into an agreement to provide some service to a customer even after the one year warranty period had expired.marvin would do so,however,only if the customer specifically requested it,and even then marvin would not agree to replace its products.rather,marvin might agree to help the buyer with any claim the buyer might have against the manufacturer of a substance used on marvin products.
it is true that a judgment may be supported by inference.the inference,however,must be a reasonable conclusion from the evidence and can not be based upon suspicion,imagination,speculation,surmise,conjecture or guesswork.citation.beck development southern pacific transportation th,d.here,the fact that marvin could produce no warranty issued to carrau does not support an inference that marvin provided carrau with anything other than the standard warranty.it was not marvin burden to prove that it did not write a special warranty for carrau,but carrau burden to prove that such a warranty was in fact written.carrau produced no evidence that he,or anyone working for him,requested a special warranty,and the undisputed evidence was that marvin would provide special warranties only upon a customer request.
even if the jury reasonably could have inferred that marvin had entered into some kind of special agreement with carrau,there was no evidence from which it further might be inferred that marvin agreed to warrant the windows to be free from defects for a period of years.the evidence established no more than that marvin might agree to help a purchaser with any claims against some other entity,such as the manufacture of the wood preservative,that had provided an extended warranty.there is no evidence whatsoever that marvin offered or agreed to help carrau with claims against the manufacturer of the wood preservative.
the scope of appellate review of a trial court denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is to determine whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,supporting the jury conclusion and where so found,to uphold the trial court denial of the motion.citation.shapiro prudential property casualty th,d.under the circumstances of this case,and on this record,it could be nothing more than speculation,surmise,conjecture or guesswork that marvin entered into a special agreement to provide carrau with a warranty that it had not provided to any other,to warrant the windows to be free from defects for a year period.substantial evidence,therefore,does not support any finding by the jury that marvin entered into an agreement with carrau to provide him with such a warranty.
carrau final theory was that marvin advertisements acted as an express warranty that its products were durable and long lasting.in support of this theory,carrau introduced a number of the advertisements as exhibits.the advertisements made assertions such as that marvin windows would be,even in the most challenging of climates,and would provide the homeowner with an investment that will stand him in good stead for years to come.carrau also introduced evidence that carrau,who himself is a contractor,was familiar with marvin advertisements and brochures,and was aware of marvin reputation as one of the finest manufacturers of wood windows,and a company that stood behind its product.
it is recognized that there are times when an assertion made in advertising,if read and relied upon by the purchaser,may act as a warranty.see white summers,uniform commercial code ed,see,also,lane swanson sons d.we find,however,that we need not decide if the jury was entitled to conclude on the evidence that marvin advertisements amounted to an express warranty,because we find that carrau claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
california uniform commercial code section,subdivision provides that actions such as this must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued.subdivision provides a cause of action accrues when the breach occurs,regardless of the aggrieved party lack of knowledge of the breach.a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made,except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.it is undisputed that carrau failed to file suit within four years of the delivery of the windows.the jury verdict,therefore,can be sustained only if the exception stated in subdivision applies,if it might be concluded that marvin warranty explicitly extended to future performance of the goods.
no california case has determined the scope of the future performance exception to california uniform commercial code section but it has been the subject of numerous decisions from other jurisdictions.a few courts have construed the exception broadly.in perry augustine,wl,for example,cited by carrau,a manufacturer of a heating system represented that the system would be able to heat at degrees inside at a degrees outside temp.the court found that a breach of warranty could not occur until the weather outside had reached degrees.insurance of north america abb power generation,also cited by carrau,involved the installation and maintenance of a steam turbine facility,and an assertion by the seller that the facility would be capable of producing steam and electricity.the court,finding that the contract was in fact a service contract rather than a contract for the sale of goods,applied a general limitations statute to the transaction,concluding that under it,the buyer was required to file suit within six years of substantial completion of the installation.id.at.the court also found,in dicta and without analysis,that the future performance exception to section would apply because it would not be possible to determine whether the warranty had been breached until some time in the future.id.at.
the vast majority of the courts that have considered the point,however,have concluded that the future performance exception to the limitations period applies only when the seller explicitly has agreed to warrant its product for a defined period of time.these courts reason that california uniform commercial code section reflects the drafters intention to establish a reasonable period of which sellers need not worry about stale warranty claims.standard alliance black clawson cir.nonetheless,a buyer and a seller can freely negotiate to extend liability into the future but an express warranty which makes no reference at all to any future date should not be allowed to extend past the limitations period thus,where an express warranty is made which extends for a specific period of time,one year,the policy reasons behind strict application of the limitations period do not apply.if a seller expressly warrants a product for a specified number of years,it is clear that,by this action alone,he is explicitly warranting the future performance of the product or goods for that period of time.id at.
under this reasoning,general assertions as to the performance or durability of a product,such as the assertions made by marvin in its advertisements,do not explicitly extend to future performance of the product.in cooper power systems union carbide cir,for example,it was held that an assertion that vinyl paints maintain their good appearance for many years,does not amount to a warranty explicitly extending to future performance.in economy housing continental forest products cir,the court held that there was no warranty explicitly extending to future performance in language that plywood is intended for permanent exterior exposure.in parrino sperling,the court found that a descriptive statement in an owner manual,asserting that a wheelchair would serve the buyer well for many years,does not rise to the level of a warranty that explicitly extends to the future performance of the goods.in jones laughlin steel sales cir,the court concluded that no extended warranty arose from the seller literature asserting that the seller had been producing roofing felts made of asbestos for over years and could cite many asbestos roofs that have been performing satisfactorily after more than forty years of exposure to heat,cold,water,air and even fire.and,all of this service with minimum
