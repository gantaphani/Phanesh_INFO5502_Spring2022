lars gentry,henry camp,mike hyder,james conboy,william pommerening,and michael osacky appellants appeal a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained ebay,ebay demurrer to appellants second amended complaint without leave to amend.in that pleading,appellants alleged ebay violated california autographed sports memorabilia statute,by failing to furnish a certificate of authenticity to persons who purchased autographed collectibles through its web site.appellants also alleged ebay was negligent and engaged in unfair business practices under the unfair competition law ucl bus.and,et based on its failure to supply such certificates as well as its acts in distributing false certificates,permitting other false representations to be placed on its web site,and making its own false or misleading representations.in part,the trial court ruled ebay was not a dealer within the meaning of civil code section and appellants failed to plead around the statutory immunity provided by section of title of the united states code hereinafter section,which otherwise protected ebay conduct.appellants contend the trial court erred in sustaining ebay demurrers without leave to amend because they sufficiently alleged ebay is an auctioneer that provides the requisite description of collectibles as being autographed within the meaning of civil code section and section does not preempt their causes of action against ebay.
we conclude appellants can not state a cause of action against ebay under civil code section because their allegations reveal ebay did not sell or offer to sell the collectibles at issue.additionally,we conclude imposition of civil code section liability on ebay in this particular case,as well as liability for negligence and violation of the ucl,is inconsistent with section because appellants causes of action ultimately hold ebay responsible for misinformation or misrepresentations originating with other defendants or third parties.because appellants can not maintain their civil code section claim,and section otherwise immunizes ebay from civil liability under these circumstances,we affirm the judgment of dismissal.
factual and procedural background 
ebay promotes itself as the world largest online marketplace for the sale of goods and services among its registered users it operates an service in which it enables member sellers to offer items for sale to member buyers in what ebay characterizes as either or fixed price formats.to better enable users to place items for sale on its site,ebay provides descriptions to its users under various product categories and subcategories.for sports items,ebay web site has a sports product category with the following subcategories sports autographs sports memorabilia sports sporting goods and sports trading cards.ebay sports autographs subcategory is further organized into to differentiate autographed sports collectibles by particular leagues.
in september,various individuals embarked on a plan to sell faked autographed sports memorabilia to consumers.specifically,angelo marino,gloria marino,gregory marino,john marino and kathleen marino the marino defendants purchased sporting goods items and photographs from retail stores,forged signatures of professional athletes upon them,and employed wayne bray and donald frangipani to produce false certificates of authenticity for the items.the marino defendants then sold most of the forged items to stanley fitzgerald and phil scheinman,larger dealers who mostly used ebay auctions to eventually sell the forged items to consumers.stanley fitzgerald did business as stan the man memorabilia and stan sports memorabilia.phil scheinman did business as smokey sportscard.
appellants are individuals who purchased forged autographed sports items including baseballs,photographs and autographed pieces of paper or cuts,from fitzgerald,scheinman or the marino defendants through ebay 
intending to act on behalf of all purchasers of autographed sports collectibles purchased through ebay from september,to the time of trial,appellants sued the marino defendants,bray,frangipani,fitzgerald,scheinman and ebay.their complaint asserted causes of action against ebay for negligence,violation of the ucl,violation of civil code section and for injunctive relief.in that pleading,appellants alleged ebay,having identified itself as an auctioneer in press releases and provided a venue for auctions,violated california law by either failing to provide a certificate of authenticity expressly warranting the autographed sports memorabilia or failing to insure that such a certificate was being provided by any other party to the auction.according to their allegations,during the class period,ebay auctioned thousands of items of sports memorabilia created by the marino defendants,a substantial number of which were accompanied by fraudulent certificates of authenticity and expert opinions produced by bray and frangipani.ebay charged placement fees to dealers listing an item for auction,and success fees percentage fees when items were sold.further,appellants alleged,ebay gave customers a false sense of confidence by maintaining a forum that permitted dealers and consumers to give positive or negative feedback to other dealers or consumers,giving endorsements to certain dealers based on the volume of sales and positive feedback ratings,and advising users it may suspend or terminate their account if it finds them to have engaged in fraudulent activity in connection with the web site.
appellants alleged that as early as,ebay received numerous complaints from consumers and warnings from governmental agencies that a substantial amount of forged sports memorabilia was being auctioned on ebay,but ebay ignored the warnings and allowed the forged sports memorabilia scheme to continue in order to continue to reap millions of dollars in profits for itself.
ebay generally demurred to appellants ucl,civil code section and injunctive relief causes of action.the trial court sustained the demurrers,granting appellants ten days leave to amend in order to plead around the federal statutory immunity of section as to their ucl claim and allege that ebay provided a description of items listed on its web site as being autographed for purposes of their civil code section claim.the court sustained without leave to amend ebay demurrer to appellants cause of action for injunctive relief on the ground it was not an independently cognizable cause of action.
appellants second amended complaint added several new allegations.they alleged at all relevant times,ebay was a dealer as defined in civil code section a in that,among other things,ebay engages in sales transactions,conducted by means of written exchanges,between ebay and its users.the written exchanges consist of a series of invitations for offers for the purchase of collectibles made by ebay and offers to purchase made by ebay users and culminates in the acceptance by ebay of the highest or most favorable offer made by a participating user.ebay engages in the sale or offer for sale of autographed collectibles in or from this state.ebay provides descriptions of collectibles as being autographed as defined in civil code sic.it is undisputed that ebay has never furnished a certificate of authenticity with a collectible at the time of sale.appellants further alleged ebay tightly regulates the transactions it conducts on its web site,controls the content of its web site by delisting items it deems questionable and filters the web site to prevent items from being sold.they alleged ebay provided descriptions of the sports items as being autographed under the product categories and subcategories,including the subcategory sports autographs and that,o ftentimes,ebay provided a standardized description of these sports items with a photo.
in connection with their civil code section cause of action,appellants alleged during the class period,ebay,in selling or offering to sell to a consumer collectibles in or from this state,provided a description characterizing an item as being autographed.however,ebay has failed to furnish consumers with a certificate of authenticity containing the required disclosures and express warranties for collectibles auctioned through its services.appellants sought to plead around the immunity of section by alleging ebay was itself responsible for creating or developing information on its web site,and that the information was not obscene or otherwise similarly objectionable.
ebay again demurred.with respect to the ucl and negligence causes of action,it argued appellants failed to plead around section statutory immunity.as to the civil code section cause of action,ebay argued it is not a dealer and does not provide descriptions of specific collectibles within the meaning of civil code section plaintiffs did not allege the items they purchased through ebay were sent from or received in the state of california and it could not be held liable for aiding and abetting sales under that statute.ebay presented the declaration of its associate general counsel,who explained the operation of ebay web site and specifically how items were assigned their general category designations.he averred that members who wished to place an item for sale on ebay would themselves choose the main category,sports and subcategories,autographs under which their item would be listed for sale.thereafter,the web site would prompt the seller to provide other information,including the title and description of the item.ebay requested that the court take judicial notice under evidence code section,subdivision h of the fact a user listing an item for sale on ebay web site selects the category and subcategory under which her item will appear on ebay web site.appellants did not object to or otherwise oppose ebay request.
the trial court granted ebay unopposed request for judicial notice and sustained ebay demurrers without leave to amend.it ruled appellants could not allege ebay provides a description of that collectible as being autographed within the meaning of civil code section because ebay web site only included category labels,which were not descriptions of specific collectibles and which were actually chosen by the user,not ebay.the court also concluded the statute was silent as to aiding and abetting liability.as for the negligence and ucl causes of action,it ruled appellants had not pleaded around the immunity provided by section.it thereafter entered a judgment of dismissal in ebay favor.appellants timely filed their notice of appeal.

applying these standards,we review the sufficiency of appellants pleadings to ascertain whether they state causes of action for violation of civil code section,negligence,and violation of the ucl.
ii.claim for alleged violation of the autographed sports memorabilia statute,
a.the statute 
civil code section,entitled autographed sports memorabilia,regulates the sale of autographed sports items,broadly termed collectibles,subd.a the statute generally forbids dealers of collectibles from representing an item as a collectible if it was not autographed by the sports personality in his or her own hand,subd.c upper deck authenticated,cpg direct.it also places various obligations on such dealers.specifically,subdivision b of the statute requires dealers to provide certificates of authenticity of a prescribed form and content.it provides in part whenever a dealer,in selling or offering to sell to a consumer a collectible in or from this state,provides a description of that collectible as being autographed,the dealer shall furnish a certificate of authenticity to the consumer at the time of sale.the certificate of authenticity shall be in writing,shall be signed by the dealer or his or her authorized agent,and shall specify the date of sale,subd.b.
the statute defines a dealer as follows dealer means a person who is in the business of selling or offering for sale collectibles in or from this state,exclusively or nonexclusively,or a person who by his or her occupation holds himself or herself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to collectibles,or to whom that knowledge or skill may be attributed by his or her employment of an agent or other intermediary that by his or her occupation holds himself or herself out as having that knowledge or skill.dealer includes an auctioneer who sells collectibles at a public auction,and also includes persons who are consignors or representatives or agents of auctioneers.dealer includes a person engaged in a mail order,telephone order,or cable television business for the sale of collectibles,subd.a.
business of selling or offering to sell collectibles 
appellants contend they stated a cause of action against ebay under civil code section by alleging ebay is an auctioneer that engages in the sale or offer for sale of autographed collectibles in or from this state,provides descriptions of collectibles as being autographed,yet has never furnished the requisite certificates of authenticity under the statute.
ebay advances several arguments in support of the proposition appellants can not,as a matter of law,allege it is a dealer within the meaning of civil code section.preliminarily,it maintains we must reject the majority of appellants parroting the language of the mere legal conclusions and focus upon those allegations that flesh out the details of the sales transactions.ebay argues the nonconclusory allegations of the second amended complaint,combined with judicially noticeable facts as to the operation of its web site,demonstrate ebay does not provide descriptions within the meaning of civil code section because it is actually the user who selects the product categories of his or her item for sale and does not sell or offer to sell collectibles because,as appellants allege in other portions of their pleading,it is in fact the individual defendants who sold the forged items to appellants.we are persuaded by the latter argument.
as stated,liability as a dealer under civil code section requires that the dealer be exclusively or nonexclusively in the business of selling or offering for sale collectibles in or from this state.civil code,subd.a.here,appellants specific allegations reveal ebay is not in the business of selling or offering to sell the collectibles at issue rather,it is the individual defendants who sold the items to plaintiffs,using ebay as a venue.in reaching this conclusion,we acknowledge we are required to construe appellants allegations liberally,with a view towards substantial justice between the parties,king central bank cal d,skopp weaver cal d.but this rule does not permit us to ignore long established rules of pleading.accordingly,we apply the rule that specific allegations control general pleadings.careau security pacific business credit,d.see also stowe fritzie hotels,cal d,where there is any inconsistency between the specific allegations upon which a conclusion must be based and the conclusion,the specific allegations control clack state of california ex rel.of pub.works d,where a fact is pleaded in general or conclusionary terms,followed by an inconsistent specific allegation,the latter controls.
the general allegation that ebay engages in the sale or offer for sale is irreconcilable with other,more specific allegations.these allegations describe the specific operations of the individual defendants,expressly stating that the sellers of the forged items were fitzgerald or scheinman through their respective business entities.as appellants alleged,the scheme began with the marino defendants conduct in faking autographs of celebrated sports figures on baseballs,photographs and other collectibles and forwarding those items to fitzgerald or scheinman,who then placed them for sale on ebay by,in part,designating the appropriate categories contained on the web site these factual allegations control.while inconsistent theories of recovery are permitted citation a pleader can not blow hot and cold as to the facts positively stated.citations.manti gunari d.
section immunity 
notwithstanding our conclusion above,we additionally hold,under the facts presented,placing liability upon ebay for failing to provide a warranty under civil code section would be inconsistent with and hence preempted by section,which was incorporated by congress into the final version of the communications decency act and the telecommunications act of.see.sess,stat.the operative provision of section states n o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.c.the statute further provides 
e effect on other laws 
nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any state from enforcing any state law that is consistent with this section.no cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any state or local law that is inconsistent with this section.e,emphasis added.
in zeran america online,cir zeran,cert.den,d,the court held section,by its plain language,created a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make interactive service providers liable for information originating with a user of the service.id.at.specifically,precludes courts from entertaining claims that would place a computer service provider in a publisher role.thus,lawsuits seeking to hold a service provider liable for its exercise of a publisher traditional editorial as deciding whether to publish,withdraw,postpone or alter barred.zeran,supra,at.reiterating congress findings and policy statements in section subdivisions a and b the court observed congress recognized the threat that lawsuits pose to freedom of speech in the new and burgeoning internet medium.the imposition of tort liability on service providers for the communications of others represented,for congress,simply another form of intrusive government regulation of speech.section was enacted,in part,to maintain the robust nature of internet communication and,accordingly,to keep government interference in the medium to a minimum none of this means,of course,that the original culpable party who posts defamatory messages would escape accountability.while congress acted to keep government regulation of the internet to a minimum,it also found it to be the policy of the united states to ensure vigorous enforcement of federal criminal laws to deter and punish trafficking in obscenity,stalking,and harassment by means of computer.citation.congress made a policy choice,however,not to deter harmful online speech through the separate route of imposing tort liability on companies that serve as intermediaries for other parties potentially injurious messages.zeran,supra,at.
other courts have applied zeran reasoning to bar not only defamation claims,but other tort causes of action asserted against interactive service providers.see kathleen city of livermore th,d court of appeal affirmed judgment of dismissal in city favor holding a city was immune under section from liability under state causes of action for misuse of public funds,nuisance and premises liability for library acts in providing computers allowing access to pornography doe america online,so d,following zeran in concluding section directly preempted florida law in a negligence action based upon america online,aol distribution of information depicting child pornography the court rejected the argument that allegations aol knew or should have known about the distribution of such materials created liability distinct from that of any publisher schneider,internet book vendor was immune from tort negligent misrepresentation,interference with business expectancy and contractual liability arising from allegedly false statements about the plaintiff and his business made by third parties in the book review section patentwizard,kinko d,defamation liability ben ezra,weinstein,america online,cir,doe one oliver,barring claims for negligence,negligence per se,failure to prevent transmission of in violation of a connecticut statute,intentional nuisance and infliction of emotional distress based upon sending of blumenthal drudge,barring defamation claims against aol for statements made in the drudge report,an online gossip column,even though aol had contracted for the reports,retained certain editorial rights as to its content,and aggressively promoted the report the court expressed sympathy with the plaintiff but concluded congress had made a policy choice to provide immunity even where the interactive service provider has an active,even aggressive role in making available content prepared by others.
subsection c of section thus immunizes providers of interactive computer services service providers and their users from causes of action asserted by persons alleging harm caused by content provided by a third party.this form of immunity requires the defendant be a provider or user of an interactive computer service the cause of action treat the defendant as a publisher or speaker of information and the information at issue be provided by another information content provider.c.
appellants concede for purposes of this appeal that ebay is an interactive computer service provider and appellants do not expressly challenge the application of section to liability based on content placed on ebay web site by ebay users or other third parties.rather,they contend section does not apply because they seek to enforce ebay independent duty under the statute to furnish a warranty as the provider of descriptions,not as a publisher.we disagree.
the substance of appellants allegations reveal they ultimately seek to hold ebay responsible for conduct falling within the reach of section,namely,ebay dissemination of representations made by the individual defendants,or the posting of compilations of information generated by those defendants and other third parties.under section,ebay can not be treated as the publisher or speaker of content supplied by other information content providers.c.if by imposing liability under civil code section we ultimately hold ebay responsible for content originating from other parties,we would be treating it as the publisher,the original communicator,contrary to congress expressed intent under section c and e 
in connection with appellants argument relating to the sufficiency of their civil code section cause of action,appellants point out they alleged ebay provided its own descriptions of collectibles through its lists of product categories,but also assert,to the extent the individual defendants created the ultimate descriptions of their faked collectibles,ebay provided those descriptions within the meaning of the statute by making them available to the users of its web site.in opposition to ebay demurrer,they argued it does not matter under civil code section who creates the original specific description of the memorabilia,because the obligation to furnish a warranty arises when a dealer provides the description in offering or selling the item and the description characterizes the item as being autographed therefore,although the specific description of an item originates with the seller,ebay,by making the description available over its auction website,then provides the description to its consumers.
while the fact ebay does not create the description may be of no significance to liability under civil code section as appellants maintain,it is highly significant for purposes of assessing the application of section.appellants do not dispute the fact,judicially noticed by the trial court that it was dealers fitzgerald and scheinman,not ebay,who chose their own category description for the item offered for sale.thus,for purposes of applying section immunity,we consider it was the individual defendants who falsely identified the product as authentically autographed in order to place their items on ebay for sale.on the basis of appellants allegations,holding ebay responsible for providing a warranty under civil code section when it merely made the individual defendant false product descriptions available to other users on its web site,or provided the web site on which the individual defendants designated their collectibles as autographed,puts ebay in the shoes of the individual defendants,making it responsible for their publications or statements.we therefore conclude enforcement of appellants civil code section cause of action is inconsistent with section because it would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.english general,d.
iii.negligence cause of action 
apart from the cause of action under civil code section,which we have held is barred,appellants negligence cause of action is based on allegations that ebay itself misrepresented the safety of purchasing items from the individual defendants and knew or should have known the individual defendants were conducting unlawful practices but failed to ensure they comply with the law.in an attempt to plead around section with respect to these causes of action,appellants generally allege ebay was an information content provider in that it was responsible for the creation of information,or development of information,for the online auction it provided through the internet that ebay did not act as an internet service provider and the information at issue descriptions of collectibles as autographed did not concern the publication of obscene or similarly objectionable materials 
these conclusory and argumentative allegations are followed by more specific averments.appellants more specifically described the information purportedly developed by ebay for its safety program,identifying it as consisting of a star symbol,a power sellers endorsement,and a feedback forum.appellants alleged ebay encourages its users to rely upon its feedback forum prior to engaging in a sales transaction.the feedback forum purportedly allows dealers and consumers to rate a sales transaction with a compliment a positive feedback,a criticism a negative feedback,or other comments a neutral feedback.ebay has advertised that,a positive ebay rating is worth its weight in gold.a dealer or consumer who achieves a designated level of positive feedback is awarded a star symbol display next to the user name,which is color coded to indicate the amount of positive feedback received by the user.in addition to the feedback forum,ebay designed a power sellers endorsement,which purportedly is an award given to select ebay dealers based on the volume of sales and positive feedback ratings.in reality,however,ebay safety programs have contributed to enormous damage to autographed sports memorabilia consumers.for example,the feedback forum allows anyone to rate a dealer,even if there has never been a sales transaction between the parties.thus,fitzgerald and scheinman have at least hundreds of positive feedback ratings which are unrelated to any sales transactions.most,if not all,of these positive feedback ratings are or provided by other dealers.bold in original emphasis added.
none of these allegations place ebay outside the immunity for service providers.as ebay points out,the allegations reveal that ebay feedback forum is comprised of negative or positive information provided by third party consumers and dealers.likewise,the star symbol and power sellers designation is simply a representation of the amount of such positive information received by other users of ebay web site.appellants negligence claim is based on the assertion that the information is false or misleading because it has been manipulated by the individual defendants or other parties.based on these allegations,enforcing appellants negligence claim would place liability on ebay for simply compiling false misleading content created by the individual defendants and other.we do not see such activities transforming ebay into an information content provider with respect to the representations targeted by appellants as it did not create or develop the underlying misinformation,ben ezra,weinstein,and company,america online,supra,aol communication of errors in stock information provided by other entities,and deletion of stock symbols and other alteration of information from its data base to correct such errors was not creation or development of information under section definition of an information content provider.we are constrained from enforcing such liability under california law because it would treat ebay as the publisher or speaker of the individual defendants materials,and thereby conflict with section.
we reach the same conclusion with regard to appellants general assertion that ebay knew or should have known about the individual defendant illegal or fraudulent conduct but failed to take steps to ensure they comply with the law.this claim seeks to hold ebay responsible for having notice of illegal activities conducted by others on its web site,and for electing not to take action against those third parties,including by withdrawing or somehow altering the content placed by them.this is the classic kind of claim that zeran found to be preempted by section,as one that seeks to hold ebay liable for its exercise of a publisher traditional editorial functions.zeran,supra,at.such claims have been uniformly rejected by the courts that have considered them,doe america online,supra,so d holding plaintiff negligence claim based on the allegation aol knew or should have known third parties used its service to distribute child pornography was preempted by section doe one oliver,supra,at holding plaintiffs failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted for negligence,negligence per se and breach of contract based on aol failure to prevent transmission of because they were precluded by section schneider,supra,at holding plaintiffs claim based on failure to remove an offensive posting,an exercise of editorial discretion,was protected under section.
finally,taking as true the fact ebay makes the statement on its web site that a positive ebay rating is worth its weight in gold,such an assertion can not support a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation regardless of federal statutory immunity because it amounts to a general statement of opinion,not a positive assertion of fact.an essential element of a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation is that the defendant must have made a misrepresentation as to a past or existing material fact.christiansen roddy d.the law is quite clear that expressions of opinion are not generally treated as representations of fact,and thus are not grounds for a misrepresentation cause of action.citations.representations of value are opinions.citation.sports,th,d,citing baji,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,pp.rest d torts,a representation is one of opinion if it
