in,the legislature required judicial review of proposition settlements because of concern that in some cases,defendants and private plaintiffs have found common ground by entering into a settlement that does not provide any real protection to the public in the event of a violation,but does provide compensation to the plaintiffs attorneys.rules,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.the legislature sought to prevent settlements which simply result ion sic inadequate public warning in exchange for payments of attorney fees.rules,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.
judicial review disclosed the accuracy of the legislature concerns.the admission of no violation did not deter litigation or settlement consumer cause,johnson johnson th,d johnson johnson,and settlements were entered at the direct expense of the public interest.consumer defense group rental housing industry members th,d consumer defense group.
this appeal reflects additional defects both in the process of negotiating proposition settlements and the substantive test used by the trial court to decide whether to enter the parties settlement as the court judgment.in this case,some of the respondents were promised that for one low settlement amount they could buy relief regardless of the chemicals involved and regardless of who might have brought a claim against you or might bring a future claim against you.the only requirement was that they join a trade organization and ask to be sued.in evaluating the settlement agreements,the court failed to evaluate whether the judgments served the public interest.the court should not surrender its duty to see that the judgment to be entered is a just one when it approves a consent judgment.california state auto.bureau superior court cal d.we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
consumer advocacy group first sued hotels based on secondhand smoke 
eight years ago,consumer advocacy group cag first served hundreds of hotels,many of which are respondents in this appeal,with notices alleging violations of proposition based on secondhand smoke.cag first set of notices were found invalid in yeroushalmi miramar sheraton th,d miramar.while that appeal was pending,cag served a second set of notices and,subsequently,a third set of notices.in consumer advocacy group,kintetsu enterprises of america th,d,we considered the validity of cag second and third sets of notices.that case is pending in our high court.
consumer defense group then expanded the secondhand smoke litigation 
counsel for consumer defense group cdg and the mckenzie group tmg took over in the midst of the cag litigation.it is unclear why some lawsuits are brought by cdg,some by tmg,and some by both plaintiffs however,for purposes of this appeal they are indistinguishable,and we refer to them collectively as cdg.while the cag litigation was pending,cdg sent notices similar to cag alleging violations of proposition based on secondhand smoke.the trial court found cag and cdg initial notice to be almost identical in,when settlement negotiations were underway between cdg and the hotels,cdg sent an amended notice of violations to the following chains of hotels wyndham international,patriot american hospitality,la quinta corporation,la quinta inns,la quinta properties,pacifica hotel company,doubletree hotels,embassy suites,hampton inn,red lion,club hotel,promus hotel corporation,hilton hotels corporation,hotel sofitel,accor north america,and kintetsu enterprises company of america.collectively,hotel respondents.
the amended notice covered not only secondhand tobacco smoke,but also cleaning supplies and related activities,construction activities,furnishings,hardware and electrical components,personal hygiene and medical supplies,combustion sources,office and art supplies and equipment,landscaping supplies and pesticide treatment,food and beverage service,exposures,equipment and facility maintenance,recreation,swimming pools,hot tubs and beaches,and retail sales.capitalization omitted.
counsel for hilton hotels explained that throughout these years of trying to get this thing resolved with cag,we had a new plaintiff who came in the picture.the new plaintiff said we would like to work out a scheme which would benefit the public,and help you get these cases settled.we jumped at the chance.it appears that cag attempted to participate in some of the settlement proceedings resulting in the consent judgments between cdg and the hotels,but was excluded from the negotiation sessions.a letter from counsel informed cag that it was not a party,and therefore was not invited to participate.
five hotel consent judgments 
cdg and hotel respondents negotiated five separate stipulated consent judgments,and the judgments were approved by the court hotel judgments these judgments covered five different types of exposure reduced from the original agreement covering many other types of exposure.for example,the wyndham judgment covers tobacco products,tobacco smoke and secondhand tobacco smoke and their constituent chemicals,motor vehicle exhaust and its constituent chemicals,acetaldehyde and formaldehyde based on their presence in furnishings,including into the air,acrylamide based on its presence in baked and fried foods,benzo a pyrene and other chemicals produced from barbecuing or broiling meats and fish,and lead based on its presence in electrical components 
the following provisions are similar in each of the five consent judgments.the consent judgments describe the status of cag litigation as follows since approximately,various organizations have sent notices to a number of industries,including the hotel industry,throughout the state alleging violations of proposition and section et of the business and professions code the unfair competition act.the notices,in general,were based on alleged exposures to consumers,customers,guests,employees and members of the general public to tobacco tobacco products secondhand tobacco smoke.a trial court in los angeles county superior court ruled that the notices in these cases were inadequate and dismissed the cases.the california court of appeal upheld the lower court ruling on appeal.
the second wave of cases,based on new notices,include cases against hotels,gas stations,mini marts,and drugstores,among others,and allege secondhand smoke exposures as well as exposures to tobacco tobacco products most of the cases in jccp have been filed by consumer advocacy group cag.defendant covered properties were the subject of a lawsuit brought by cag the cag lawsuit alleged violations of both proposition and the unfair competition act.on march,the court granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by defendant,dismissing the cag lawsuit in its entirety with prejudice due to inadequate notice.cag is appealing the dismissal.in addition,since the dismissal,both cag and plaintiff have filed new notices and new or amended complaints against the defendant plaintiff notice includes allegations dating back to the same time period covered by the cag lawsuit.
the consent judgment also refers to cag as follows in order to avoid continued and protracted litigation,plaintiff and defendant collectively,the parties wish to resolve certain issues raised by the notice and the cdg lawsuit and the cag lawsuit,pursuant to the terms and conditions described herein in addition,in entering into this consent judgment,both plaintiff and defendant recognize that this consent judgment is a full and final settlement of all such noticed chemicals claims that were raised or that could have been raised in the cag lawsuit,because the settlement of the cdg lawsuit moots any and all claims in the cag lawsuit operates as res judicata collateral estopp e l to bar any and all such claims in the cag lawsuit.this includes all such claims related to tobacco products,tobacco smoke and secondhand tobacco smoke,motor vehicle exhaust,acetaldehyde and formaldehyde based on their presence in furnishings,including into the air,and lead based on its presence in electrical components brought,or which could have been brought,by plaintiff and cag under proposition,as well as all claims brought,or which could have been brought,by plaintiff and cag under the unfair competition act.plaintiff and defendant also intend for this consent judgment to provide,to the maximum extent permitted by law,res judicata protection for defendant against all other claims based on the same or similar allegations as to the noticed chemicals.italics omitted.
defendant willingness to enter into this consent judgment is based upon the understanding that this consent judgment will fully and finally resolve all claims related to tobacco products,tobacco smoke and secondhand tobacco smoke and their constituent chemicals,motor vehicle exhaust and its constituent chemicals,acetaldehyde and formaldehyde based on their presence in furnishings,including into the air,and lead based on its presence in electrical components brought both by plaintiff and by cag,and that this consent judgment will have res judicata effect to the extent allowed by law with regards to both the proposition allegations and the unfair competition act allegations.therefore,defendant expressly reserves the right to withdraw from this consent judgment at any time and for any reason up until such time as the consent judgment becomes final,including any litigation relating to this consent judgment as well as any and all appeals relating to the consent judgment.defendant further expressly reserves the right to withdraw from this consent judgment at any time and for any reason up until any litigation by cag or any other third party regarding the cag lawsuit the validity of this consent judgment is fully and finally resolved in defendant favor,including any and all appeals.italics omitted.
the following was among the provisions describing the finality of the judgment the judgment is a full and final judgment with respect to any claims regarding the noticed chemicals asserted in the cdg lawsuit and the cag lawsuit against the released parties and each of them,and the notice against defendant regarding the covered properties,including,but not limited to a claims for any violations of proposition by the released parties and each of them including claims arising from consumer product,environmental and occupational exposures to the noticed chemicals,wherever occurring and to whomever occurring,through and including the date upon which the judgment becomes final,including any and all appeals b claims for violation of the unfair competition act including,but not limited to,plaintiff and cag asserted right to injunctive and monetary relief the judgment further purports to release defendant from liability with respect to matters regarding the noticed chemicals alleged in the cdg lawsuit and the cag lawsuit and forever discharge defendant and its future owners from liability.
two pages discuss the preclusive effect of the judgment.according to the judgment,it c onstitutes full and fair adjudication of all claims against defendant,including,but not limited to,all claims set forth in the cag lawsuit,because of the preclusive effect of the settlement of the cdg claims on the cag claims and because cag is a party before this court in jccp,based upon alleged violations of proposition and the unfair competition act,as well as any other statute,provision of common law or any theory or issue which arose from the alleged failure to provide warning of exposure to tobacco products,tobacco smoke and secondhand tobacco smoke and their constituent chemicals 
the judgment provides for injunctive relief described as clear and reasonable warnings.defendant has been in compliance with proposition warning requirements relating to environmental and occupational exposures because it posts,and has posted,warnings at the covered properties.with regard to the alleged exposures to the noticed chemicals,defendant either has posted and agrees to continue to maintain,or will post within ninety days following the entry of judgment,a warning at the primary points of entry at each of the covered properties and on the employees bulletin board or inside of the employees handbook the warning indicates that the facility contains chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects and that a brochure is available at the front desk.
with respect to secondhand smoke,the hotel chains agreed to place a sign at every location at each of the covered properties where smoking is permitted,including either inside of any guestroom that is designated for smokers or at the elevator landing area on each floor with designated smoking rooms.after stating that it was in compliance because it already posted a warning,the hotel chains also agreed to post a warning in gift shops regarding exposure to tobacco products.
cdg settlement with chla 
the court also approved a separate stipulated settlement between cdg and california hotel lodging association chla,which included hundreds of hotels chla judgment.according to its chief executive officer,james abrams,chla is an industry trade association with over members who own and operate lodging establishments.according to counsel for cdg,the trade association only got into this matter after these cases had been,the hotel industry cases had been in litigation for a number of years.we had been litigating against the major franchises for approximately two years when we were approached by the trade association.
chla negotiated with cdg and then sent out information regarding the settlement in a memorandum identified as a red alert our objective is to create a settlement procedure wherein payment of a low negotiated settlement amount and low attorneys fees and costs will effectuate a global resolution that will benefit every california innkeeper who elects to participate in it.ch la is extremely pleased to inform the industry that we have accomplished the goal of negotiating a settlement the details of the global settlement negotiated on your you choose to take advantage of described below.emphasis in original.the red alert further indicated the benefits included c omprehensive relief from all past claims for one low settlement amount and indicated such relief was available regardless of the chemicals involved and regardless of who might have brought a claim against you or might bring a future claim against you.
according to the red alert,t his settlement is available only to ch la members in good standing,those whose dues payments are current.once an innkeeper notifies ch la that intends to participate in the settlement the lawyers at jmbm will confirm that it has no conflicts of interest in representing you,and then proceed to send you a standard engagement letter for this representation,a joint defense agreement and,if needed,a conflicts waiver form indicating that you have agreed to participate with other ch la members in this settlement.upon confirmation of your participation,the innkeeper will then be asked to complete a detailed questionnaire that will enable preparation of the necessary paperwork in a way that is specifically focused on each of the innkeeper properties.these documents will be required to prepare a necessary new comprehensive notice of intent to sue from graham martin,which will be sent to you.emphasis in original.
chla judgment 
the chla judgment is similar to the hotel judgments,except the scope of the chla judgment is substantially broader in addition,the chla judgment,in contrast to the hotel judgments,excludes numerous chemicals in discussing injunctive relief,the chla judgment states defendants,or many of them,maintain they have been in compliance with proposition warning requirements because they post,and have posted,proposition warnings at the covered properties.
similar to the hotel judgments,the chla judgment provides this court finds,and the parties agree,that entry of this stipulated consent judgment and providing the warnings and brochure comprising the compliance methodology specified above in this section shall satisfy all requirements and obligations under proposition with respect to any and all actual environmental,occupational,and consumer product exposures to the noticed chemicals.the court further finds that the compliance methodology is clear and reasonable.
opposition and hearings 
both cag and the attorney general opposed the six settlements.the court described the chla deal as a friendly deal and the court expressed concern that it may be too cozy.nevertheless,the court approved the settlements as amended and entered them as the court judgments.with respect to the hotel judgments the court found no collusion.i have nothing but conclusory and somewhat inflammatory statements on that subject,which i not considering as having a great deal of merit.the court made no similar finding with respect to the chla judgment.cag appealed from the judgments and we denied respondents motion to dismiss on the basis that cag is not a party to the litigation.the attorney general filed a brief of amicus curiae.
discussion 
threshold issues include standing and justiciability.we begin there and then consider the crux of the parties a trial court is required to consider the public interest when it evaluates a proposed consent judgment brought by a private plaintiff who is suing on behalf of the public interest.
cag has standing to appeal 
respondents contend cag lacks standing to appeal because it is not a party to the settlement agreements that resulted in the judgments.if that were the only relevant fact,we would agree.but respondents fail to mention the following facts respondents negotiated the settlement of cag litigation by including an explicit finding that each judgment c onstitutes full and fair adjudication of all claims set forth in the cag lawsuits.respondents also persuaded the trial court to predetermine the estoppel effect of its judgments,thereby purporting to bar cag from future litigation 
code of civil procedure section affords an aggrieved party standing to appeal.cag is an aggrieved party within the meaning of this statute even though it is not named as a party to the consent judgments,because the consent judgments purport to resolve cag lawsuits.harris alcoholic bev.appeals bd.d.t he test in this regard is whether the party seeking to appeal has an interest which appears on the record marsh mountain zephyr,th,d a person bound by res judicata has standing to appeal life county of los angeles d.a party who would be bound by the doctrine of res judicata,whether or not a party of record,is a party sufficiently aggrieved to assert appellate rights.the provisions that purport to settle cag lawsuits and preclude cag from subsequent litigation afford cag standing to appeal 
ii.justiciability 
johnson johnson,supra,th at page,d,which vacated a consent judgment resolving proposition litigation where the plaintiff had agreed that the covered products fall within the no significant risk level provided under proposition,was decided after this case.but the questions posed by the trial court,which respondents never answered,raise similar concerns it is not clear whether there was a dispute between cdg and the hotels concerning compliance with proposition,whether the hotels were violating the whether instead,the litigation was,as the attorney general suggests,merely an effort to obtain a judicial permit sanctioning the warnings the hotels already were providing 
while the record lacks the information necessary to determine justiciability with respect to many of the chemicals,it is clear that the excluded chemicals in the chla judgment,chemicals the parties agree do not give rise to an exposure which requires a proposition warning do not represent a justiciable controversy.there is no distinction between that definition and products that fall within the no significant risk level provided under proposition,the admission found fatal to justiciability in johnson johnson,supra,th at page,d.
iii.the trial court must find that a proposition consent judgment is just and serves the public interest 
standard of review 
cag and respondents agree that the consent judgment should be reviewed for abuse of discretion just as in class action litigation.for example,one respondent cites owners for fair franchising southland th,d,for the following proposition o ur task is limited to a review of the trial court approval for a clear abuse of discretion.citations.we will not substitute our notions of fairness for those of the trial court and the parties to the agreement.citations.so long as the record is adequate to reach an intelligent and objective opinion of the probabilities of success should the claim be litigated and form an educated estimate of the complexity,expense and likely duration of such litigation,and all other factors relevant to a full and fair assessment of the wisdom of the proposed compromise,it is sufficient.citations.of course,such an assessment is nearly assured when all discovery has been completed and the case is ready for trial.citations.
in a class action lawsuit,the court undertakes the responsibility to assess fairness in order to prevent fraud,collusion or unfairness to the class,the settlement or dismissal of a class action dunk ford motor th,d.the purpose of the requirement of court review is the protection of those class members,including the named plaintiffs,whose rights may not have been given due regard by the negotiating parties.id.at,d officers for justice civil service com n,supra,at wershba apple computer,th,d same.
both class action litigation and proposition litigation affect the interests of unrepresented unrepresented class members or unrepresented members of the public.given the similarities between the trial court obligations in reviewing a proposition consent judgment and a class action consent agreement,the standard of review on appeal should be analogous.so long as the trial court adheres to correct legal criteria,our review is circumscribed and deferential this court should accord g reat weight to the trial court judgment and review it only for an abuse of discretion.owners for fair franchising southland,supra,th at,d.to the extent that it appears the trial court decision was based on improper criteria or rests upon erroneous legal assumptions,these are questions of law warranting our independent review.wershba apple computer,supra,th at,d.
b.the parties apply the wrong legal test 
discerning the legal requirements for approval of a proposition consent judgment is a question of law,subject to de novo review.foster snyder th,d.in federal class action litigation,the trial court determines whether the judgment the court is being asked to enter is fair,reasonable,and adequate.fed.rules,rule e c,see,in re wireless tele.fed.cost recovery fees lit.cir.that test has been adopted by some california courts as a tool to evaluate a proposed class action settlement.dunk ford motor th,d.
cag urges this court to employ that test,analogizing this case to a class action and claiming that a private enforcer acting under proposition is essentially a representative of a class of persons comprised of the public.respondents argue proposition litigation fundamentally differs from class action litigation and,therefore,can not be subject to the fair,reasonable,and adequate test.
neither side is correct.the fair,reasonable,and adequate test derives from rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which provides in pertinent part the court may approve a settlement,voluntary dismissal,or compromise that would bind class members only after a hearing and on finding that the settlement,voluntary dismissal,or compromise is fair,reasonable,and adequate.the legislature did not include the fair,reasonable,and adequate test when it codified judicial review of a proposition settlement and the absence of the rule indicates that it does not apply to proposition litigation.adoption of kelsey cal th,d,court may not add provisions to a statute.
although the fair,reasonable,and adequate test does not apply,the prerequisites for approving a proposition consent judgment are similar.to stamp a consent agreement with the judicial imprimatur,the court must determine the proposed settlement is just.respondents contrary view ignores the general rule that a trial court should not approve an agreement contrary to law or to public policy.bechtel superior court d.see also plaza hollister.partnership county of san benito th,d a court can not validly enter a judgment or order which is void even if the parties agree to it.respondents also disregard the specific rule that the court can not surrender its duty to see that the judgment to be entered is a just one,nor is the court to act as a mere puppet in the matter.california state auto.bureau superior court,supra,cal d.
in the context of proposition litigation,necessarily brought to vindicate the public interest,the trial court also must ensure that its judgment serves the public interest.health and safety code section,subdivision f provides if there is a settlement of an action brought by a person in the public interest under subdivision d,the plaintiff shall submit the settlement to the court for approval and the court may approve the settlement only if the court makes all of the following findings a any warning that is required by the settlement complies with this chapter.b any award of attorney fees is reasonable under california law.c any penalty amount is reasonable italics added.settlement without consideration of the public interest eviscerates the purpose of proposition,and the plain language of the statute contradicts respondents argument that the public interest is not one of the three findings stated by the legislature to be required.california mfrs.public utilities com.cal d,interpretive constructions which render some words surplusage,defy common sense,or lead to mischief or absurdity,are to be avoided.the legislature used the permissive term may when it authorized court approval of a settlement that has compliant warnings and reasonable fees and penalties.there is a difference between saying the court can not approve a settlement without these conditions and the court must approve a settlement if it finds these conditions.consumer defense group,supra,th at,d.in this case,where the judgments contained pages of provisions,the court should have considered each provision it was not relegated to assessing only the warnings,penalties and fees.
judicial review is consistent with policies favoring settlement 
respondents including cdg who is purporting to represent the public argue that fairness concerns are irrelevant and the inquiry,which impedes rather than encourages settlements,should be avoided.otherwise,they warn,unnecessary litigation and wasted court time is inevitable.to some extent respondents are law favors the settlement of disputes as our high court clarified in neary regents of university of california cal th,d,neary.settlement is efficient it reduces costs,saves resources,and minimizes court congestion.id.at,d.the parties are best positioned to understand their interests and resolve a dispute in a mutually beneficial manner without court intervention into the settlement.neary teaches that i n ordinary civil actions such the parties come to court seeking resolution of a dispute between them.id.at,d.
unlike neary,this is not an ordinary civil action.cdg purports to act on behalf of the public and the settlement potentially has broad implications as cdg describes it as a standard for the industry as a whole.more significantly,unlike in a settlement between two parties,the legislature expressly required judicial review of a proposition settlement brought by a private plaintiff in order to safeguard the rights of the public.the parties agreement to a mutually beneficial set of terms does not ensure that the policies underlying proposition or the public interest in the litigation were considered.in contrast to neary,where the court made clear that c ollateral estoppel was not an issue neary,supra,cal th at,d,respondents seek to use the doctrine of collateral estoppel and refer to it expressly in each consent judgment.
where the rights of the public are implicated,the additional safeguard of judicial review,though more cumbersome to the settlement process,serves a salutatory purpose.it reminds the parties that,in addition to their own interests,the public interest is also relevant.it also reinforces the rule that the strong public policy favoring the settlement of litigation does not excuse a contractual clause that is otherwise illegal or unjust.timney lin th,d.to the extent that judicial review deters settlements,it should deter only those that are unjust or ignore the public interest.
application of the correct test compels reversal 
some of the provisions of each judgment are so contrary to the public interest that standing alone,they require the reversal of the judgments.the broad release purports to preclude the public from future litigation of both known claims and additionally discovered ones.under the terms of the release,any member of the public loses the right to pursue a claim regardless of whether cdg had knowledge of the claim and regardless of whether relevant scientific knowledge has changed.the judgments determine that t he provision of said warnings shall be deemed to satisfy any and all obligations under proposition by any and all person s or entity ies with respect to any and all environmental and occupational exposures to noticed chemicals and therefore do not cover only past conduct as respondents argue.the provision allowing defendants to unilaterally arguably renders each judgment illusory.similarly,the no force and effect provision not only grants the parties unusual powers to,on their own,invalidate a judgment,but it also renders precarious any benefit received by the public from the judgment.because these provisions require reversal,we need not evaluate each provision in the six judgments.our silence regarding the remaining provisions should not be interpreted as approval of them.
finally,the record belies respondents argument that the trial court actually considered whether the settlements served the public interest.the court identified but never resolved key issues such as justiciability.when the court expressed concern that chla and cdg were friendly and initially was not inclined to enter a stipulated consent judgment that will serve only as a shield against legitimate prosecution of proposition violations,the court never fully addressed these crucial concerns.respondents repeatedly and incorrectly remind ed the court that under the statutory mandates for approval of settlements,your inquiry is quite limited from the standpoint of reviewing settlements under prop.under health and safety code section subdivision d,the court required to determine is the warning,clear and reasonable,two,are the attorneys fees reasonable,and three,are the penalties reasonable.that the confines of the court inquiry from the standpoint of whether the settlement passes muster as being in the public interest.so i submit to your honor that the sausage making,if you will,of how we got here,while it may have pecuniary or some interest in terms of,i guess,issues that really do pertain to the settlement,it really not the focus of what we are here and what the court job is in relation to the settlement.
the trial court never acknowledged that it had a duty to find that the settlements were in the public interest and the provisions of the judgments in this case do not serve the public interest.the trial court never identified the specific benefit the public would reap from the consent judgments,and one court has held that generic warnings,such as those in this case,are at the direct expense of the public interest.consumer defense group,supra,th at,d.for these reasons,the judgments must be reversed.
we have focused on the judgments,not the notice,because of the unusual procedural posture of the case where the judgments were challenged by a party who was not entitled to notice.if the parties choose to resubmit proposed judgments to the trial court,in addition to considering whether the judgments serve the public interest as discussed in this opinion,the court must consider justiciability as discussed in johnson johnson,supra,th,d notice as discussed in consumer defense group,supra,th,d and the statutory requirements of adequate warnings,reasonable fees,and reasonable penalties.
disposition 
the consent judgments are reversed.appellant and the attorney general are entitled to costs on appeal.
for example,the notice served on pacifica hotels was served
