centers partners obtained a judgment of more than million for deceptive acts and warranty breaches that a jury found had been committed by ppg industries.but as the two corporations had no direct business dealings,none of the claims stemmed from transactions between them.instead,jmb suit relied on warranty and dtpa claims received by assignment from its predecessor in interest.
the court of appeals affirmed the judgment,joining several other courts that have held or assumed dtpa claims are assignable a few other opinions suggest they are not we granted the petition in this case to decide the matter.
we hold that assigning dtpa claims would defeat the primary purpose of the encourage individual consumers to bring such claims themselves.additionally,we find the personal and punitive aspects of dtpa claims can not be squared with a rule allowing them to be assigned as if they were mere property.
we also conclude the trial court erred in holding that jmb claim was not barred by limitations,and that its claim was a basis of the parties bargain as a matter of law.accordingly,we reverse the judgment,and remand for a new trial of the latter claim alone.
background 
one houston center,a skyscraper in downtown houston,was completed in april and originally owned by houston center corporation hcc.the exterior included more than twindows,a glass window unit manufactured and installed by ppg.twindows were chosen for their insulating ability and color,which blended with other buildings in the houston center complex.
by july of,a large number of the twindows showed fogging and discoloration.at hcc request,ppg manufactured and installed replacements for of the building windows pursuant to a contractual warranty.the replacement project took more than two years.
several years later,hcc entered negotiations to sell one houston center to jmb.during its due diligence,jmb learned of the earlier window problems,and that to a limited extent they continued.when jmb inquired whether any warranties still applied,ppg replied that all had expired.
jmb bought the building as is in december as part of a million purchase.hcc assigned to jmb all warranties relating to the building,and jmb waived all dtpa claims against hcc.
when extensive twindows problems appeared in,jmb sued ppg for violating the dtpa and breaching warranties issued to hcc.a jury found for jmb on all claims,assessing the cost to replace every twindow in the building with comparable but nondefective window units at.the trial court trebled the award under the mandatory provisions of the dtpa and after a bench trial awarded another in attorney fees.
ii.assignment of dtpa claims 
ppg first attacks the dtpa award,asserting that dtpa claims can not be assigned.to determine whether dtpa claims are assignable,we look first to the words of the statute.
the sale of twindows was a sale of goods,and thus subject to the warranty provisions of chapter of the texas business and commerce code the ucc chapter of the same code the dtpa allows consumers to bring breach of warranty claims under that chapter as well thus,a consumer may choose to bring warranty claims under either chapter,or both as jmb did here.
the purposes and provisions of the ucc and the dtpa are,of course,not the same otherwise,there would have been no need for both.the primary difference relevant here is that the ucc expressly provides that warranty claims are assignable while the dtpa says nothing about assignment.
a statute silence can be significant when the legislature includes a right or remedy in one part of a code but omits it in another,that may be precisely what the legislature intended if so,we must honor that difference 
of course,legislatures do not always mean to say something by silence.legislative silence may be due to mistake,oversight,lack of consensus,implied delegation to courts or agencies,or an intent to avoid unnecessary repetition.but we must at least begin our analysis by noting that the legislature clearly knew how to indicate that warranty claims were assignable,but did not do so in the dtpa.
in some cases of statutory silence,we have looked to the statute purpose for guidance accordingly,we next look to the purposes of the dtpa to determine whether assignment of claims is consistent with its goals.
the dtpa primary goal was to protect consumers by encouraging them to bring consumer complaints 
this subchapter shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes,which are to protect consumers against false,misleading,and deceptive business practices,unconscionable actions,and breaches of warranty and to provide efficient and economical procedures to secure such protection 
while the dtpa allows the attorney general to bring consumer protection actions one of the statute primary purposes is to encourage consumers themselves to file their own complaints 
the legislature provided for the recovery of attorney fees under the deceptive trade practices act,as encouragement to those abused by certain proscribed conduct to avail themselves of the remedies of the act 
o ne purpose of the dtpa treble damages provisions is to encourage privately initiated consumer litigation,reducing the need for public enforcement 
t he legislative intent was to encourage aggrieved consumers to seek redress and to deter unscrupulous sellers who engage in deceptive trade practices 
making dtpa claims assignable would have just the opposite effect instead of swindled consumers bringing their own dtpa claims,they will be brought by someone else.
the legislature did not intend the dtpa for everybody.it limited dtpa complaints to consumers,and excluded a number of parties and transactions from the dtpa,including claims by businesses with more than million in assets and certain claims in which consumers were represented by legal counsel if dtpa claims can be assigned,a party excluded by the statute such as jmb here could nevertheless assert dtpa claims by stepping into the shoes of a qualifying assignor.this would frustrate the clear intent of the legislature.
the court of appeals reasoned that assignment would accord with one of the dtpa other consumer fraud but this proves too much commercial trading in almost any kind of claim would likely encourage its proliferation,but raises a host of other concerns 
first,the dtpa provisions were intended to motivate affected consumers they may provide a different motivation for those who might traffic in such claims.it is one thing to place the power of treble damages in the hands of aggrieved parties or the attorney general it is quite another to place it in the hands of those considering litigation for commercial profit.
second,appraising the value of a chose in action is never easy,due to the absence of objective measures or markets consumers are likely to be at a severe negotiating disadvantage with the kinds of entrepreneurs willing to buy dtpa claims cheap and settle them dear.the result of making dtpa claims assignable is likely to be that some consumers will be deceived twice.
third,in many cases consumers may not even know they have dtpa claims when they sign a general assignment included in contractual boilerplate if such assignments are valid,the claims meant to protect consumers will quite literally be gone before they know it.in this case for example,both jmb and hcc were wealthy and sophisticated corporations,yet both denied any knowledge of a potential dtpa claim against ppg at the time of the building sale there was no assignment of claims generally,and no mention specifically of dtpa claims against ppg instead,jmb relies solely on a general assignment of the building warranties if this is enough,then hcc assigned away its dtpa rights against ppg without knowing it and without receiving anything for it the million in incentive damages left over after every twindow is replaced will serve as a pure windfall for jmb.every conceivable purpose of the statute is defeated if consumers may lose their claims by accident.
jmb makes no attempt to defend commercial marketing of dtpa claims,arguing only for assignment in cases like which it bought the underlying building and will bear the costs of repairing it.but allowing dtpa claims by those who purchase defective goods from a consumer shifts the focus of the dtpa from deceptive practices to defective products if dtpa claims may be assigned to subsequent buyers like jmb,treble damages will often go to wealthy entrepreneurs rather than the consumers who were actually defrauded.
moreover,jmb only claim here is based on the written assignment.jmb acquired no dtpa claims merely by becoming a subsequent owner of one houston center and asserts none in its own right.as jmb only basis for dtpa claims is the written assignment,it is hard to see how its claims are different from those that might be obtained by arbitrageurs.
in sum,allowing assignment of dtpa claims would ensure that aggrieved consumers do not file them,that some consumers receive nothing in compensation,and others are deceived a second time.all would defeat the very purposes for which the dtpa was enacted.
in some cases of statutory silence,we have also looked to related principles with respect to the assignment of claims,we have recognized the collapse of the rule that generally prohibited such assignments but the assignability of most claims does not mean all are assignable exceptions may be required due to equity and public policy 
courts addressing assignability have often distinguished between claims that are and remedial and claims that are personal and punitive,holding that the former are assignable and the latter are not the dtpa claims here unlike the warranty claims under the ucc clearly fall in the latter category.
unlike most other states,texas adopted the ucc without choosing any of its three options concerning who may sue on warranties instead,the legislature expressly delegated that choice to the courts pursuant to that mandate,in nobility homes of texas,shivers,we held a downstream purchaser of a mobile home could bring implied warranty claims directly against a remote manufacturer,even though there was no privity of contract between them while it appears we have never addressed the same issue regarding express warranties,several lower courts have applied the same rule in that warranties pass with the goods 
but in amstadt brass,we held downstream purchasers of homes could not bring dtpa claims against remote manufacturers and suppliers of a defective plumbing system,because the deceptive acts alleged were not committed against or communicated to them in connection with their own purchases recognizing the similarity to this case,jmb asserted no dtpa claims in its own right,as it had no connection with ppg original twindows sale,and never saw any ppg advertisements or warranties before it bought the building 
thus,we have established a clear distinction between dtpa and warranty claims a downstream buyer can sue a remote seller for breach of an implied warranty,but can not sue under the dtpa.clearly,if warranty claims are assignable because they are,dtpa claims must be something else there must be a personal aspect in being duped that does not pass to subsequent buyers the way a warranty does.
dtpa claims generally are also punitive rather than remedial.in this respect,it is important to remember that the dtpa overlaps many causes of action,including breach of contract,warranty,fraud,misrepresentation,and negligence frequently,the dtpa is pleaded not because it is the only remedy,but because it is the most favorable remedy.in this case,for example,jmb pleaded one set of factual allegations that was then incorporated wholesale into claims for breach of contract,warranty,and the dtpa.the contract and warranty claims offered a remedy,but only the dtpa offered treble damages.
in such cases,the most important role of the dtpa is the remedies it adds,not the ones it duplicates economic damages and attorney fees are certainly remedial,but they were recoverable in contract and warranty long before the dtpa was passed.the dtpa adds mental anguish and punitive damages damages that could hardly be more personal.
jmb never asserted a claim for mental anguish,but many dtpa claimants do and will.if consumers can assign their dtpa claims,they may still have to testify at trial about the nature,duration,and severity of their mental anguish but someone else will keep the money.
jmb argues the dtpa treble damages are remedial rather than punitive because they address individual rather than public injuries.our dissenting colleagues would also find dtpa damages remedial,but overlook the fact that twenty years ago we held exactly the opposite.in pace state,we held a dtpa award could not be recovered from the real estate recovery fund a fund set up for reimbursing aggrieved persons because treble damages under the dtpa are punitive damages.
jmb also points to cases in which federal statutory penalties have been held assignable.statutes that create a remedy where none previously existed may be remedial for example,there was no remedy at common law for being driven out of business by a monopolist but that can not be said of jmb warranty claims here.
of course,if manufacturers make representations or warranties directly to consumers,the latter may sue directly despite the absence of privity for breach of express warranty or violation of the dtpa but jmb neither alleged nor proved that was the case here.as dtpa claims are too personal and punitive to pass with goods from one owner to the next,it is hard to see why they should pass with the same goods by assignment 
finally,we must consider whether assignment of dtpa claims may increase or distort litigation.we have never upheld assignments in the face of those concerns.we have prohibited assignments that may skew the trial process,confuse or mislead the jury,promote collusion among nominal adversaries,or misdirect damages from more culpable to less culpable defendants 
first,as noted above,dtpa claims are unlike most claims in providing for mental anguish and punitive damages.jurors are bound to experience some confusion in assessing mental anguish of a consumer,or punitive damages based on the situation and sensibilities of the parties,when the affected consumer is not a party.the legislature intended dtpa lawsuits to be efficient and economical assessing personal and punitive damages in these circumstances is likely to make that goal difficult.
but more important,there is a serious risk here of skewing the adversarial process.when a sells goods to b who sells them to c,if the goods prove defective and there were no dealings between a and c as is often the case in the stream of commerce,c will naturally look to b for a remedy.but if dtpa claims are assignable,b and c both have a strong incentive to direct the suit elsewhere for relief.if b settles with c for a small amount and assigns any dtpa claims it may have against a,c now has a case with potential punitive damages,and b has avoided potential liability.thus the litigation will continue with the parties in different the results that have led us to prohibit assignments in other contexts.
in this case jmb made no complaints against hcc,even though the window problems jmb discovered were very similar to the ones hcc encountered a few years before further,to avoid any discovery rule problems,hcc joined jmb in downplaying the earlier problems that must have seemed disastrous to hcc at the time.we cast no aspersions on the litigants here we only note that assignability of dtpa claims may encourage some buyers to not a seller who may have been the one that actually misled them.
the dtpa is primarily concerned with the deceivers and the deceived this gives the entire act a personal aspect that can not be squared with a rule that allows assignment of dtpa claims as if they were merely another piece of property.
our dissenting colleagues assert we should skip over the question of dtpa assignability which they proceed to address in detail to address the threshold question whether hcc had a valid dtpa claim to assign.in reviewing this dtpa judgment in favor of an assignee,an appellate court could first ask whether the assignment,if proper,concerned a valid dtpa claim as our colleagues do,or whether the dtpa claim,if proper,could be assigned as do we.clearly,the more important question to the jurisprudence of the state is whether dtpa claims can be transferred a matter of conflict in the courts of appeals,not whether dtpa claims survived the amendments a matter as to which there has been neither case nor conflict in the twenty years since.
our dissenting colleagues suggest in a hypothetical that under our decision today,if a tampers with a car odometer before selling it to b who sells it to c,c has no dtpa remedy against of course,that is already the case under amstadt if there is no assignment.moreover,c can also sue b under the dtpa perhaps for representing the car had lower mileage than it really had and b can bring an indemnity and contribution claim under the dtpa against if we assume as their hypothetical does that a did the tampering,the effect is likely to be the pays dtpa damages,and c receives them.but if b did the tampering and given the severe federal penalties no one is likely to admit it,the assignment of dtpa claims skews the normal litigation process by encouraging c to combine with b against 
because only an assignment is before us,we do not decide whether dtpa claims survive to a consumer heirs,a related but sometimes distinct inquiry for the same reason,we also reserve for another day the assignment of claims that were created within and could not be brought without the dtpa,such as false sales or during a disaster finally,our holding does not prohibit equitable assignments,such as a interest assigned to a consumer attorney 
but because of the statutory differences between the ucc and the dtpa,the personal litigation by consumers that was the dtpa primary purpose,the personal and punitive nature of both dtpa claims and dtpa damages,and the risks to the adversarial process,we hold that dtpa claims generally can not be assigned by an aggrieved consumer to someone else.
iii.the warranty 
although jmb can not recover treble damages under the dtpa by assignment or otherwise,the jury answers to two warranty questions would support jmb recovery of actual damages and attorney fees.jmb can assert breach of warranty claims against ppg because,unlike dtpa claims,warranty claims pass with the underlying goods and are assignable to a subsequent purchaser 
one houston center was substantially completed april.upon completion,ppg issued a limited warranty of its materials and work 
ppg industries,warrants all material furnished and work performed is in accordance with plans and specifications as amended by changes thereto by the owner or his authorized representative,and further warrants material furnished and labor performed to be free of defects and watertight for five years from april.should such a defect occur within this warranty,ppg industries,shall,upon receipt of written notice,repair replace the defective product.
the jury found ppg breached this warranty ppg asserts the claim is barred by limitations.
the ucc generally requires suit on breach of warranty claims within four years of delivery,regardless of when the buyer discovers defects in the goods this absolute limitation period was intended to provide a uniform date of accrual beyond which sellers need not worry about stale warranty claims,or retain records to defend against them under that provision,limitations on ppg warranty would have run on april.
but accrual is extended for warranties that explicitly guarantee future performance 
a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made,except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered 
because ppg explicitly warranted the twindows would be free of defects for five years,it falls within this exception thus,warranty claims against ppg accrued not upon initial delivery,but when a reasonable buyer should have discovered any defects,up until the end of the warranty period when the time of such performance expired.
the parties signed a tolling agreement preserving all claims that could have been brought as of september,a date ten months before jmb actually filed suit on july.in the liability questions,the jurors were instructed not to consider any breach of warranty that should have been discovered before september,four years before the tolling agreement was signed,and three months before jmb bought the building.ppg asserts the jurors affirmative answers represent a misunderstanding and misapplication of the discovery rule,as major defects with the twindows were discovered more than seven years earlier.
by july,hcc had discovered serious problems with the twindows,and complained in a letter of deterioration of the reflective coating.necessarily,a buyer files a complaint about a product only after learning of a defect.thus,the discovery rule generally ends upon such a complaint,at least with respect to matters asserted therein 
after receiving the complaint,ppg undertook a massive remedial effort.between and,it replaced more than twindows at houston center,a quarter of the total in the skyscraper.these activities could hardly have gone unnoticed.as the court of appeals noted,a failure rate of might suggest something was amiss.
but jmb asserts the discovery rule does not apply because neither hcc nor jmb learned until much later that the problem was a defective design,and thus extended to every window in the building.the court of appeals agreed,pointing to evidence that jmb acted diligently in attempting to determine the cause of the problem and in attempting to correct it.
but the discovery rule does not linger until a claimant learns of actual causes and possible cures.instead,it tolls limitations only until a claimant learns of a wrongful injury thereafter,the limitations clock is running,even if the claimant does not yet know 
the specific cause of the injury 
the party responsible for it 
the full extent of it or 
the chances of avoiding it 
it is true that not even ppg could spot a defect in every twindow at this time.but at trial jmb asserted a design defect affecting every twindow from inception,whether noticeable yet or not when twindows failed,as a matter of law hcc should have known of this claim.
for the same reason,we must reject the argument that each window unit was a separate product and separately warranted,and thus should be treated separately for discovery rule purposes.if that were the rule,limitations would never begin to run until a defect was discovered in every single window.texas limitations law is not that patient.
this is not to say either hcc or jmb was required to file suit every time it noticed a scratch.the evidence was undisputed that a few defective window units are inevitable in a construction project of this size a few isolated defects would not establish discovery as a matter of law.thus,the federal eighth circuit held defective windows on a project involving did not establish as a matter of law the buyer should have known the windows were defective similarly,the court of appeals has repeatedly held in the context of underground leaks that the discovery rule does not end when the first leak is discovered nor does it continue until all the leaks are known c instead,it ends when an owner knows of enough leaks to indicate the problem is not isolated 
as a matter of law,the problems here were not isolated,and defective windows is not a few.it was undisputed that ppg had never experienced a failure on this scale,either before or since.while the end of the discovery rule is normally a fact question for the jury there can be no difference of opinion under the circumstances presented here.indeed,if this extraordinary number of failures is not enough to put a claimant on notice that something is amiss as a matter of law,then the discovery rule has no boundaries other than those each juror cares to set.
the court of appeals disregarded what hcc surely knew about defects in the twindows by pointing to ppg efforts to repair them.but once hcc discovered widespread defects,ppg efforts to comply with its warranty obligations,without more,did not the discovery rule.
jmb begins by asserting ppg admitted the discovery rule tolled limitations on all warranty claims until when it refused to repair or replace any more twindows.the trial court instructed the jury that ppg breach of warranty could not have been discovered until ppg refused to perform its obligations under the warranty,its duty to repair.ppg did not object to this part of the charge,though it did assert in motions at the end of jmb case,at the conclusion of all the evidence,and after the verdict that the discovery rule barred jmb warranty claims as a matter of law.
we disagree that ppg failure to object to the jury instruction was an admission.a judicial admission must be a clear,deliberate,and unequivocal statement a party failure to object at trial may constitute waiver,but it is no judicial admission.jmb further implies this was a waiver.but a party asserting that a claim or defense is established as a matter of law does not have to object to the form in which the question is submitted to the jury a complaint objects to any submission,proper form or not.
next,jmb asserts that even if ppg did not admit the matter,the jury was entitled to find that ppg repair efforts extended limitations.but almost one hundred years ago,we held a seller repair efforts do not extend the limitations period for breach of warranty claims texas courts have been applying that rule ever since as do the courts of most other states 
serious problems would arise if the rule were otherwise.for example,if the statute of limitations was tolled every time a car needed repairs during a warranty period and what car does not,the warranty period would become perpetual,and dealers would be loath to make any.we should encourage sellers to attempt repairs tolling limitations every time they do might discourage them from doing so at all.
and it would give consumers little in return.faulty repairs or false assurances of repair are already independently actionable under current for breach of the implied warranty applicable to repair services or as dtpa violations accordingly,consumers who discover defects and ask a seller to repair them do not need to toll limitations on the initial warranty claim,as they have a new limitations period relating to the repairs.jmb chose not to assert such claims,but that is not a good reason to extend the limitations period on warranties in all other cases beyond the normal term.
we did not hold as jmb asserts in austin vaughn building that limitations was tolled until a seller stops making repairs instead,we held a warranty for repair services was not breached until further repairs were refused a warranty to make repairs is a warranty for services,not of goods,and thus falls outside the ucc we long ago held that limitations accrues upon breach of a repair warranty only if that was the basis of the suit if instead the basis was a warranty as to the goods themselves,limitations accrues upon delivery 
in this case,jmb asserted no claim for breach of a repair warranty.the basis of jmb complaint was not that ppg refused to supply more twindows according to everything pleaded and proved,more twindows was the last thing jmb wanted.jmb complaints arose from defects in the underlying goods,and thus accrued when they failed,not when ppg refused to keep manufacturing and sending replacements with the same problem.
if a defective product is sold and the seller repairs it defectively,a buyer loses nothing by suing on the latter defect instead of the former.more important,if the seller repairs it properly,the buyer has a working product instead of a lawsuit.accordingly,we reaffirm our rule that a seller repair efforts are not alone enough to extend the limitations period for breach of warranty claims.
the court of appeals also pointed to assurances and misrepresentations ppg allegedly made about its repairs even if false assurances can toll limitations,neither the court of appeals nor jmb point to a shred of evidence establishing that is what occurred here.
in its brief,jmb assures us ppg affirmatively represented it had completely remedied any problem,the problem existed only in certain units,ppg could and would completely remedy the problem,the problem was fixed,and there was no reason for concern.but a careful review of every record reference jmb cites discloses nothing of the kind.
instead,we are directed to testimony that hcc asked for such assurances tried to get them assumed it would get them and was satisfied it had gotten them there was also evidence that hcc thought the problems were fixed believed they were fixed and could reasonably have believed they were fixed but nobody swore ppg agents ever said so.the only statement placed in the mouths of ppg agents was that they thought they could solve the problem by replacing the defective windows.this is a statement of opinion,not an affirmative representation.
further,it is undisputed that after all replacements were made,ppg unequivocally quashed any false hopes hcc may have entertained.in an internal memo,the assistant property manager of houston center management company acknowledged that ppg gave no guarantees or assurances about the repairs 
the replacement of defective lites by ppg is now completed.this completion satisfies all surveys and inspections to date.activities ended approximately march.we finally received a return call from bill unrath,a quality control engineer with ppg in pittsburgh on march.he cited causes for the lites coating deterioration as follows bill went on to say that there is no way to predict if more lites will become affected.he also said that ppg would continue to stand behind their product,and if we have any more defective lites to please call him.
in my opinion,the above causes cited sound somewhat logical.however,i find it hard to believe that the tolerances of the coating in regard to temperature are so critical.rather,i suspect that formulation of the coating or application to the glass was substandard.ppg may simply be attempting to provide a scientific explanation when an apology for sloppy workmanship may be more appropriate.in either case,they are picking up the tab.
future action regarding lite replacement may be necessary as more defects are discovered.ppg will be notified should this occur.
if houston center representatives believed just the opposite of what the record shows they were told as a matter of law they should have known better.
it is true there was evidence ppg knew far more than it was telling anyone about the twindows defects.but mere silence is not fraudulent unless there is a duty to disclose no such duty existed between these contracting corporations 
in sum,ppg repair efforts may have been futile and its explanations much less than forthcoming,but jmb points to no evidence that either owner was misled by ppg false assurances rather than its own false hopes.false hopes are not enough to extend limitations.accordingly,jmb warranty claims were barred as a matter of law.
iv.the warranty 
the jury also found ppg breached a limited warranty,which the trial court found was established as a matter of law.ppg argues the trial court erred by refusing to submit this warranty to the jury,and by failing to find it was barred by limitations.
there was no warranty in any of the one houston center contract documents,even though they included hundreds of pages detailing every aspect of this building project.instead,jmb relies on the following statement appearing in a ppg advertisement in sweets architectural guide,a trade publication often relied on by architects 
twindow units are warranted for twenty years from the date of manufacture against failure of the hermetic seal due to faulty manufacturing of the unit by ppg.pursuant to this limited warranty,ppg will only supply a new unit,and no labor,installation or special or consequential damages are included.this limited warranty is effective only if the unit is properly installed,and is not effective if the unit is installed in sloped glazing.ppg makes no other warranty.
ppg argues this provision does not apply to one houston center because it was not included in the contract documents,and it had been shortened before the contract here was signed.the trial court refused ppg request to submit the question to the jury,finding as a matter of law the statement in sweets constituted a warranty applicable to houston center.
the contract bid documents,the general contract,and the contract signed by contained a number of provisions regarding warranties,but none approaching twenty years 
the general documents and specifications issued for bids dated march,required a general guarantee regarding the curtain wall for five years from the date the work was accepted,and a specific warranty regarding the glass for five years from completion of the work 
the general contract between houston center and bellows construction corporation dated april,incorporated the contract bid documents and declared them to be the complete understanding of the parties with reference to the matters herein and therein set forth and there are no understandings nor commitments not expressly stated herein or therein 
the curtain wall and glass contract between bellows and cupples products division dated april,provided for the warranties in the general contract and a warranty for defects in materials or workmanship 
the subcontract between cupples and ppg dated august,and signed by ppg december,provided for a guarantee of all work for the period required in the general contract and bid specifications,a warranty regarding all defects,and a warranty for breakage from thermal conditions.
the absence of a warranty in any of the contract documents does not establish as a matter of law that none existed.the ucc provides that express warranties may arise other than those stated in a contract and favors construing overlapping warranties as cumulative rather than conflicting 
but neither can we hold on these facts as a matter of law,that there was a warranty.before any statement becomes a warranty,it must become part of the basis of the bargain.thus,for example,a statement can not be a basis of the bargain if one of the parties does not know about it 
the court of appeals pointed to a ucc comment explaining that for extraneous statements to become a warranty no particular reliance on such statements need be shown.while particular reliance may not be necessary,we have held several times that something rather like it is.the requirement loosely reflects the express warranty requirement of reliance,and r eliance is also not only relevant to,but an element of proof of,plaintiffs claims of breach of express warranty to a certain extent.
further,the court of appeals quotation from the comment left off before the comment does,which continues,rather,any fact which is to take such affirmations,once made,out of the agreement requires clear affirmative proof.the issue normally is one of fact.
here,there was conflicting evidence whether a warranty was a basis of the parties bargain.there was no evidence the contracting parties ever mentioned the sweets ad in their negotiations,bid documents,or contracts.there is no evidence anyone other than houston center lead architect who worked for an outside firm ever saw it.while the architect testified he relied on the sweets warranty,jurors would not have been required to credit his testimony,as he did not explain why he omitted it when he drew up the bid specifications that included numerous shorter warranties.ppg witnesses testified the parties bargain was only what they included in their contract documents,not the unmentioned advertisement.
further,there was conflicting evidence whether the warranty in sweets had been withdrawn or amended.it was undisputed that no warranty for twindows appeared in sweets in when most of them were constructed and installed,and twindows did not appear at all in the publication in when the project was accepted and the warranty issued.as the court of appeals noted,ppg business records included a letter addressed to the trade and dated before ppg contract that purported to shorten the warranty to ten years while no ppg witness could affirmatively recall when or if this letter was sent,a jury might attribute some blame for that fact to jmb failure to file suit until eighteen years later.
a jury might find the parties bargain here included a warranty in an advertisement in a trade magazine,even though they never discussed it and omitted it from the extensive contract documents.but they would not have to they might also find the parties bargain was no more than what they stated.as a result,the trial court erred in taking this question from the jury.
ppg also asserts that,even if there was a warranty,it expired along with the warranty on a date four years after extensive defects were discovered we agree with jmb that,unlike the warranty,the warranty assuming it was part of the parties bargain did not accrue until the failure of each twindow seal was or should have been discovered.
as with the warranty,the warranty explicitly extended to future performance.but breach of the two warranties did not occur at the same time.
the warranty guaranteed the twindows were free of defects,and thus was breached upon delivery in although it did not accrue until discovery within those five years because the twindows were not free of defects at that time.but the warranty guaranteed them against failure of the hermetic seal for twenty years.according to this plain language,even if every twindow contained a manufacturing defect at delivery,there was no breach of the warranty until a hermetic seal failed.further,there was no breach at all for seals that failed after twenty years.
here again,jmb argues that its warranty claims accrued in september when ppg refused to replace any more twindows.we rejected this argument with respect to the warranty because repairs do not toll limitations we reject it here for a different reason.
jmb confuses a limitation of remedy with a breach of warranty.the ucc specifically allows parties to limit the remedies for breach of a warranty to repair or replacement 
t he parties agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this chapter and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this chapter,as by limiting the buyer remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of goods or parts 
in this case,ppg specifically limited all its warranties to replacement of defective twindows units.
there are consequences connected to a seller failure to comply with a limited remedy,but changing the accrual date of limitations is not among them.where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose,remedy may be had as provided in ucc chapter.in other words,when ppg stopped supplying additional twindows in,jmb remedies were no longer limited to replacement all damages provided by the ucc became available.but it neither stopped nor restarted limitations for breach of the underlying warranty.
assuming the warranty was part of the parties bargain,breach occurred when each hermetic seal failed.as long as ppg supplied replacements,houston center owner could not because there was no breach,but because there was no damage,as the only allowable remedy had been provided.once ppg stopped making replacements,jmb could sue for seal failures that occurred thereafter,and could seek remedies other than replacement.
here,though hcc discovered defects in the twindows in the,there was no evidence all the seals had failed by then.indeed,ppg own conduct is some evidence to the contrary,as it inspected all of them but replaced only some.and ppg presented no evidence that jmb should have known every seal would fail before when the warranty expired.the parties september,tolling agreement thus preserved jmb breach of warranty claims concerning the warranty as to any seals that failed after september,or those failing before which a reasonable owner would not have discovered by that date.
there was evidence jmb learned of deterioration in twindows units during its investigations several months before it bought houston center in december there was also evidence jmb requested a survey in of how many seals had failed,and obtained a bid for replacing every twindow in the building.but the evidence did not establish as a matter of law that it should have known every seal had failed by either date accordingly,the trial court correctly submitted the question to the jury.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the court of appeal judgment and remand for trial jmb claim that ppg breached a seal warranty that was a part of the basis of their bargain,and any damages related thereto.
s,a car dealer,turns the odometer back on a vehicle that it sells to b,clearly a false and deceptive trade practice that the dtpa was designed to remedy.unaware that the odometer has been tampered with,b sells the car to c a week later and assigns all warranties associated with it.the car immediately breaks down,and c discovers that the vehicle has more miles on it than the odometer represents.after today,c has no remedy against s for deceptive trade practices because the court indiscriminately outlaws the assignment of all dtpa claims,even those that do not raise the policy concerns the court fears.
i agree with the court that dtpa assignments have the potential to raise public policy concerns,and when they do we should address them.but before proceeding to abolish,wholesale,the assignment of all dtpa those that would further the dtpa would first decide whether hcc had a dtpa claim to assign.the court skips over this threshold legal question to make a broader policy choice.addressing the first question,i conclude that hcc was not a consumer under the dtpa and was therefore not entitled to invoke its protections.having no dtpa claim itself,hcc certainly could not assign one.for this reason,i would reverse and render judgment against jmb on its dtpa claim without reaching the broader assignability question.but if i did reach that question,i would uphold the assignment in this case it is consistent with the dtpa purpose and does not violate public policy.the court decision today is inconsistent with our own jurisprudence and the legislative intent underlying the dtpa.accordingly,i concur in the court judgment insofar as it relates to jmb right to recover under the dtpa,although for different reasons.further,i agree with the court that limitations does not bar jmb claim regarding breach of the seal warranty,but i disagree that the trial court erred in finding that the warranty applied as a matter of law.for reasons that the court of appeals expressed,i would render judgment in jmb favor on the claim and respectfully dissent from the court judgment remanding that claim for a new trial.
deceptive trade practices act 
consumer status 
in,ppg contracted with hcc to provide glass and glazing for one houston center.as a buyer of ppg goods and services,hcc qualified as a consumer under the dtpa in effect at the time.in,the legislature excluded from the dtpa consumer protections entities like hcc whose assets exceeded million.in,jmb,whose assets also exceeded million,purchased the building and was assigned all warranties and claims associated with it.in,after many windows had fogged or discolored,jmb sued ppg for breach of warranty and dtpa violations.
assuming that ppg committed deceptive acts or practices in connection with selling and servicing its windows,as the jury found,only a consumer has standing to seek recovery against it under the dtpa.see knight int l harvester credit.the version of the act that applied when hcc purchased the windows defined consumer broadly to include a corporation who seeks or acquires by purchase or lease,any goods or services.act of,ch.laws,amended current version at.bus.hcc clearly qualified as a consumer under this definition.hcc still owned the building in when the legislature amended the statutory definition to exclude business consumers with assets exceeding million.act of,ch.laws,current version at.bus.hcc did not qualify as a consumer under the amended definition.for reasons that follow,i believe that the amended definition became effective immediately and operated to extinguish any dtpa claims that hcc might have had.
the dtpa is a statutory cause of action that the legislature created to protect consumers damaged by deceptive trade practices.having created the cause of action,the legislature is free to repeal or amend it at any time.see knight,at.when a party right or remedy is dependent upon a statute,the repeal of that statute without a savings clause limiting the repeal effect operates to immediately deprive the party of all rights that have not become vested or been reduced to final judgment.quick city of austin,see also knight,at carloading paso express,dickson navarro county levee improvement dist.thus,suits filed in reliance on the statute must cease when the repeal becomes effective if final relief has not been granted before the repeal goes into effect,final relief can not be granted thereafter,even if the cause is pending on appeal.quick,at see knight,at citing dickson,at.
a savings clause may modify this general rule of abatement.quick,at.texas general savings clause is found in section of the government code,which provides that the repeal or amendment of a statute does not affect the statute prior operation or any rights previously acquired under it.gov t code a.in this case,the court of appeals applied the general savings clause and held that the amendments did not immediately apply to alter the consumer status of corporations whose assets exceed the million cap.at.in doing so,though,the court ignored the act more specific amendatory language.while it may be true that a specific savings clause does not necessarily negate section general application,that does not mean the more specific language may be disregarded.if contrary legislative intent can be found in the amendatory language,the general savings clause does not apply.quick,at.accordingly,i begin by analyzing the act amendatory terms.
the amendments to the dtpa effected three separate changes.first,as already said,the amendments excluded from the act consumer protections businesses with assets exceeding million.second,the legislation allowed smaller businesses with assets of million or more to waive the act protections by written contract.finally,the act added a definition of business consumer.act of,ch.laws,current version at.bus.section then contains the following provision 
this act applies only to a contract executed on or after the effective date of this act.a contract executed before the effective date of this act is governed by the law in effect when the contract was executed.
act of,ch.laws,emphasis added.the question,then,is whether this savings provision applies only to the portion of the amending act governing contractual waivers,or if it also preserves the consumer status of corporations with assets exceeding million as to transactions occurring before the amendment effective date.i conclude that the specific amendatory language indicates the legislature did not intend to leave the consumer status of corporations exceeding the asset cap intact as to transactions.
section of the act specifically provides that the act applies only to contract s executed on or after the amendments effective date,indicating that it must have intended to preserve from the amendments immediate effects contracts that were executed before.id.the dtpa protections,though,extend beyond transactions based upon written contracts.from its inception,the dtpa has defined a consumer as anyone who seeks or acquires goods or services.act of may,ch.laws,current version at.bus.thus,consumers do not need a written contract the act encompasses those with oral contracts or no contract at all,mere shoppers.if the legislature truly meant the asset cap to apply only to contracts executed after,then it has never become operative for oral contracts or shoppers.such a reading would contravene the legislature directive that,in construing statutes,we should presume that the entire statute is intended to be effective.gov t code.
moreover,the legislature knows how to more broadly preserve claims if that is its intent.the legislature clearly expressed its intent to save all claims arising in whole or in part before its and dtpa amendments became effective.as to the amendments,the legislature stated that t his act shall be applied prospectively only.nothing in this act affects either procedurally or substantively a cause of action that arose either in whole or in part prior to the effective date of this act.act of,ch.laws.the amendatory language is similarly broad nothing in this act shall affect procedurally or substantively a cause of action arising in whole or in part prior to the effective date of this act.act of march,ch.laws.by contrast,the legislature provision is carefully limited to executed contracts,which can only refer to the contractual waiver provision.as some commentators have noted 
there is no savings clause in the amendments to the dtpa which would save a business consumer pending cause of action.the savings clause of the amendments is applicable only to contracts executed before the effective date of the amendment,waivers of dtpa claims in contracts executed before effective date are not valid.
the texas legislature clearly distinguishes its express intent regarding the immediate application of the and amendments to a pending cause of action from the amendments.in,the legislature expressly chose to save only existing contracts,no valid disclaimer of dtpa rights in contracts executed before effective date from immediate or retroactive application,and did not intend to save the cause of action of a business consumer with more than million in assets arising in whole or in part prior to the effective date of such amendment.
andy tschoepe ii,et,aspects of defending a texas deceptive trade practices b consumer protection act claim,mary.
because the specific amendatory language indicates the legislature did not intend to preserve a business consumer claim that arose before the effective date,the general savings clause found in section a has no application.thus,the amendment establishing the million asset cap became effective immediately and extinguished hcc consumer status.as a nonconsumer,then,hcc had no cause of action under the dtpa when it sold the building to jmb in the only claims jmb acquired in that purchase were potential claims.for this reason,i agree that jmb may not recover under the dtpa.but if hcc did qualify as a consumer,i would uphold the assignment of its dtpa claim to jmb when it sold the building.
assignability 
the court concludes that dtpa assignments in general,and the one in this case particularly,violate public policy and thwart the legislature purpose.while this may be true in some other case,i fail to see it here.jmb owns the defective and allegedly misrepresented twindows and has suffered real economic harm.jmb dtpa claim is,in essence,a claim,and such claims have long been freely assignable.see,freeman,allstate ins.kelly,writ ref rosell farmers.county mut.ins,no writ see also thomes porter,worth,no writ holding dtpa claim survived owner death and could be pursued by estate.moreover,principles support the assignment in this case.see thomes,at applying rules because the dtpa does not expressly provide for survival of a cause of action.
in state farm fire casualty gandy,we examined the history of assignments and the policy considerations underlying them.at early common law,a chose in action generally could not be assigned.id.at.this aversion to assignments was based in part upon courts reluctance to increase or distort litigation.see id.at.assignments were also disfavored because,under the common law,a chose in action presupposed a personal relationship between the parties which could not be transferred.see see also james ames,the inalienability of choses in action,in lectures in legal history.
over time,the demands of commerce eroded the disfavored status of assignments,although certain uniquely personal tort actions which affected their owner person,personal feelings,or as slander,libel,battery,and false unassignable under the common law.see gandy,at walter cook,the alienability of choses in action,harv.the continued nonassignability of such claims was justified by the concern that the factors determining liability and damages were so closely associated with the particular actors involved in the alleged wrongdoing that they could not be fairly assessed when one of the actors was replaced.see gandy,at freeman,at see also mallios baker,hecht,concurring.but when the injury affect ed the estate rather than the person the right of action could be bought and sold.freeman,at.thus,assignability of claims long ago became the general rule.see,graham franco,stewart r y,wolff commercial standard ins,writ ref wichita city lines,puckett,worth,aff,see also johnson rolls,noting that at common law all causes of action for damages die with the person of the party injured,or the person inflicting the injury,except such damages as grow out of acts affecting the property rights of the injured party.
gradually,assignability of choses in action expanded beyond contract and claims to include torts and other wrongful acts.see gandy,at.on the premise that assignability depended on survivability,the passage of the texas survivor statute meant that personal injury claims became assignable.see act of may,ch.laws amended current version at.civ.prac.gandy,at on the theory that assignability of a chose in action depended on whether it survived the owner death,personal injury claims thus became assignable in texas.beech aircraft jinkins iii,we are mindful of the general rule that a cause of action for damages for personal injuries may be sold or assigned.citations omitted.thus,while some of the common law reservations still remain,choses in action are now generally considered freely alienable.see gandy,at doty caldwell,no writ see also int l proteins,as a general rule a cause of action may be assigned.
in gandy,which involved an attempted assignment of an insured dtpa and other claims against his insurer,we decided the claims assignability based on considerations of equity and public policy.at see also int l proteins,at invalidating assignment of plaintiff products liability and negligence claims to joint tortfeasor as contrary to public policy.the facts presented in gandy are instructive.there,the plaintiff sued her stepfather,pearce,for sexual abuse.gandy,at.state farm,which insured the pearce home,agreed to pay for pearce defense and reserved its right to contest coverage.id.at.pearce and gandy settled the case,and,as part of the settlement,pearce assigned any claims against state farm to gandy.id.at.although pearce had originally denied ever abusing gandy,after the settlement was negotiated he agreed to a million adverse judgment reciting that he had abused her on occasions.id.at.and contrary to the position that gandy took in her suit against pearce,she argued in her suit against state farm as pearce assignee that pearce would not have been liable had state farm properly handled his defense,while pearce returned to his original contention that he had never abused gandy and would have proved his innocence had state farm provided him with competent counsel.id.
in holding that the assignment in gandy was invalid,our concerns were twofold.first,rather than resolving the suit,the assignment prolonged the litigation.even after the district court held as a matter of law that gandy claims were not covered and that state farm had no duty to defend pearce,the settlement practically guaranteed that litigation would continue because,as gandy counsel freely testified,the entire purpose of the arrangement was to find a way to recover against state farm.id.second,and more importantly,the assignment distorted the litigation,causing the parties to take positions that appeared contrary to their natural interests for no other reason than to obtain a judgment against state farm.id.thus,we held the claims nonassignable based on public policy concerns.id.at.
we have also held that mary carter agreements,which assign a plaintiff claims against a nonsettling defendant to a settling defendant,are void as against public policy.elbaor smith.these arrangements nearly always ensure a trial against the defendant and grant the settling defendant veto power over any proposed settlement between the plaintiff and any remaining defendant.id.at.they also confuse the jury by presenting a sham of adversity between the plaintiff and settling defendant.id.at.we concluded that public policy did not support arrangements that skew the trial process,mislead the jury,promote unethical collusion among nominal adversaries,and create the likelihood that a less culpable defendant will be hit with the full judgment.id.at.similar concerns that arise when parties purport to assign legal malpractice actions.see zuniga,groce,locke hebdon,antonio,writ ref noting that such assignments would cause a demeaning reversal of roles and a shameless shift of positions.
the assignment of hcc dtpa claims to jmb when it purchased the building does not present the same concerns.the assignment did not spawn litigation that would not likely have occurred otherwise.instead,the dtpa claims are in the hands of the defective windows owner,who seeks the same remedy the assignor could have pursued had it not sold the building.furthermore,the assignment does not require the assignor and assignee to assume positions contrary to their natural interests,nor is the assignment likely to cause jury confusion.consequently,the distortion of the litigation process that we deplored in gandy and elbaor is simply nonexistent.
the court additionally premises its holding on the notion that,because the dtpa permits the recovery of enhanced damages,dtpa claims are punitive in nature and thus should not be assignable.without question enhanced damages,by definition,produce an award that exceeds the amount of underlying damage and therefore have a punitive effect.but the dtpa provision also has a remedial purpose that the court entirely ignores.the remedial aspect is expressed in the statutory language,which states that the act underlying purpose is to protect consumers against false,misleading,and deceptive business practices,unconscionable actions,and breaches of warranty and to provide efficient and economical procedures to secure such protection.act of may,ch.laws,amended current version at.bus.a see generally john hill,introduction to consumer law symposium,mary,discussing the lack of consumer protections and the inadequacy of remedies for consumer complaints prior to the dtpa.the legislature has expressed its intent that the dtpa be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes act of may,ch.laws amended current version at.bus.a.we have observed that one purpose of the dtpa treble damages provision is to encourage privately initiated consumer litigation,reducing the need for public enforcement.pennington singleton,iii.the dtpa provision also acts as a deterrent in discouraging violations by others.that the damages in this case were mandatorily trebled indicates an intent that they be proportional to the magnitude of the harm caused and not dependent on the degree of the defendant culpability,making them less personal than ordinary punitive damages and underscoring the trebling provision remedial purpose.see act of may,ch.laws,woods littleton,pennington,at noting that culpability is an important consideration of section as amended in.our decision in pace state,does not negate the dtpa remedial effect.there,plaintiffs sought to recover from the real estate recovery fund,a public fund the legislature created to reimburse those who suffered monetary loss caused by unscrupulous real estate agents.id.at.relying on the statutory mandate that the fund be used for reimbursing aggrieved persons who suffer monetary damages,we noted that treble damages are punitive rather than restitutionary and t herefore the legislature could not have intended that treble damages be paid from the fund.id.at emphasis in original.designed to remedy a public harm with limited funds,the real estate recovery fund specifically provided a limited remedy.that does not mean,however,that mandatory dtpa trebling is devoid of remedial purpose.the punitive aspect that the court emphasizes is only one of several purposes that the dtpa serves 
the closely analogous sherman act provides a useful comparison.similar to the version of the dtpa in question here,a violation of the antitrust act gives rise to a claim for mandatory treble damages.a.as under the dtpa,these damages have a punitive effect,but they were also designed to deter future antitrust violations and were created primarily as a remedy.am.soc y of mech.eng rs,hydrolevel,d see,brunswick pueblo,d noting treble damages function to penalize and deter wrongdoers.and federal law is uniform in holding that an action to recover treble damages under the sherman act is not an action to recover a penalty and is assignable.see hicks bekins moving storage,cir citing chattanooga foundry pipe works atlanta.see also,sampliner motion picture patents.gulfstream iii,gulfstream aerospace,cir chiropractic coop.ass of am.med.ass n,cir health care equalization comm.of the iowa chiropractic soc y iowa med.soc y,cir pharm.ass klamath med.serv.bureau,cir fazakerly kahn sons,cir.that violations result in injury to the property or business,not the person,of the individuals bringing claims further operates in favor of assignability.see moore backus,cir united copper sec.amalgamated copper,cir 
finally,the court vastly overstates our holding in amstadt united states brass.there,we addressed whether the legislature intended that upstream suppliers of raw materials and component parts be liable under the dtpa when none of their misrepresentations reached the consumers.id.at emphasis added.our concern was that the deceptive act or practice touch the consumer transaction the defendants actions were not connected with the plaintiffs transactions,that is,the sale of the homes,in a way that justifies liability under the dtpa.id.emphasis added.there is nothing in our amstadt opinion to suggest that,had the defendants misrepresentations been directly connected with the homes sale,subsequent buyers of the homes could not assert dtpa claims by assignment.this is entirely consistent with our decision in gupta ritter homes,which involved a homeowner dtpa claim against the builder,where we said 
as between the builder and owner,it matters not whether there has been an intervening owner.the effect of the latent defect on the subsequent owner is just as great as on the original buyer and the builder is no more able to justify his improper work as to a subsequent owner than to the original buyer.
id.amstadt simply did not concern dtpa claims against a product supplier whose representations were made directly to the this case hcc.
in sum,none of the theories that have been applied to determine a claim assignability supports striking down the assignment in this case.liability is predicated upon a claim,which has long been held assignable at common law.recognizing the validity of such an assignment is consistent with the dtpa underlying purposes and does not give rise to the policy concerns that led us to invalidate the assignment in gandy.just as c should be able to assert a dtpa claim against s for turning back his vehicle odometer before sale,jmb should be able to step into hcc shoes and,were hcc a consumer,assert a dtpa claim against ppg.
ii.breach of warranty 
jmb additionally asserts claims based upon ppg alleged breach of five and warranties.i agree with the court that limitations does not bar jmb claims that are based on the seal warranty.ppg contends,though,that jmb can not recover under that warranty because it failed to obtain jury findings that the warranty formed the basis of the bargain and that jmb notified ppg of the defect within a reasonable time.see.bus.a,c.the court agrees,holding that the trial court erred in finding these elements as a matter of law rather than submitting them to the jury.i disagree.
an issue that is conclusively established as a matter of law should not be submitted to the jury.see stanley boot,bank of el paso,civ.requiring the court to submit to the jury only those questions raised by the pleadings and the evidence.thus,if the trial court correctly found that these elements were conclusively established,it did not err in failing to submit them.see green int l,solis,holding that trial court properly refused to submit a question unsupported by evidence to jury.
to be actionable,a representation relating to an express warranty must form a basis of the bargain.see.bus.cmt.sweco,cont l sulfur,paso,writ denied.ppg argues that the warranty could not have formed a basis of the bargain because there was no evidence ppg relied on it.jmb,on the other hand,relying on a comment to section,claims no particular reliance need be shown for a representation to become an actionable part of the agreement.whether or not reliance is an essential element of a claim is a question we recently noted in compaq lapray is undecided in texas.but we do not need to answer that question here because,whether or not specific reliance is a necessary element,it was shown here.it is undisputed that ppg published the warranty in sweet architectural guide before hcc accepted its bid for the twindows in order to induce customers to purchase its product.jim gatton,hcc lead architect,testified that he depended upon the information that ppg provided in sweet guide 
it was very important to us.it presented the pittsburgh plate glass ppg,as well as other glass products within the sweet architectural file.we read it very closely.we were dependent upon the information that was printed about the glass in the sweet index.
gatton specifically testified that he relied on the warranty,along with the product specifications provided in sweet,in selecting the twindows for one houston center.the only evidence that ppg offered to controvert hcc contention that it selected the twindows based on the warranty was gatton testimony that the warranty was not the only reason twindows were chosen.but it is not necessary to a breach of warranty action to prove that the warranty was the only basis upon which a particular product was chosen.to become a basis of the bargain,it need only be shown that the affirmation of fact or promise made to the buyer was part of the basis of the bargain,not the sole basis.see.bus.a.
the court concludes that the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law that the warranty was a basis of the bargain,in part,because gatton did not explain why he omitted it when he drew up the bid specification that included numerous other shorter warranties.at.but gatton testified repeatedly that the warranty was considered the equivalent of other specifications of the twindows,such as and shading coefficient,that also were not expressly stated in the contract.he explained that the warranty was part of the statement by ppg that they would provide along with the glass,along with the shading coefficient,stated with the with everything else they said about the glass.gatton had previously testified that hcc chose twindows based upon their shading coefficient,their,and the warranty because these specifications best fit the building needs.
ppg also argues that it had revised the warranty to a limited warranty before it signed the contract to supply hcc windows,and offered in support a july,a letter from ppg senior vice president informing the trade that ppg was offering a warranty,effective september.but ppg presented no evidence that this letter was ever disseminated or published.moreover,hcc accepted ppg bid on may,over three months before the purported revised warranty effective date.the testimony of ppg lay witnesses that the warranty was the operative one are conclusory legal opinions not binding on the court.see anderson snider.ppg presented no evidence of rescission or modification of the warranty.thus,the trial court did not err in failing to submit the basis of the bargain issue to the jury.
ppg also contends that the trial court erred in failing to submit the issue of reasonable notice of breach of warranty to the jury.again,i disagree.the question of reasonable notice may be decided as a matter of law.see coolidge.here,the uncontroverted evidence shows that hcc first notified ppg of a halo effect in some units in.ppg inspected the units and saw the problems.see carroll instrument controls,dist,no writ buyer gave adequate notice by showing defective part to seller.ppg received notification of problems with additional units in july.ppg notice to jmb in october that it would no longer replace failed units also suggests that it had notice of the continuing problems.
in sum,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to submit the basis of the bargain or reasonable notice issues to the jury.because legally sufficient evidence supports the jury finding that jmb neither discovered nor should have discovered ppg breach of the warranty,i would affirm the court of appeals judgment in jmb favor on this claim.
as to the warranty,ppg contends that jmb claims are barred by limitations.but jmb alleged the same injuries under the warranty,and the jury awarded the same amount of damages for each breach that it found.because the judgment can be sustained on the jury findings regarding jmb warranty claim,i would not reach ppg arguments challenging recovery under the warranty.
iii.conclusion 
i would hold that jmb may not invoke the dtpa consumer protections,and therefore concur in the court judgment to the extent it renders judgment against jmb on that claim.i also agree with the court that limitations does not bar jmb claims based on breach of the seal warranty.i disagree,though,with the court sweeping conclusion that no dtpa claims are assignable and its conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion in the manner in which it submitted the claim to the jury.i would affirm the court of appeals judgment on the claim.because the court remands that claim for a new trial,i respectfully dissent.
