in april,robinson discovered that a woman named nicole antoinette robinson had stolen her identity and opened fraudulent accounts in her name and under her social security number.shortly after discovering that she had been the victim of identity theft,robinson began the process of restoring her credit history.specifically,she filed a police report,called the federal trade commission hotline and opened a case,and spent the next five months trying to correct the erroneous entries on her credit report.as a result of her efforts,by robinson credit report was free of all fraudulent accounts caused by the identity thief.during this same time,but unrelated to her identity theft,robinson lost her job and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in may.robinson was able to obtain a discharge of her debts by september,but this was not the end of robinson financial and credit woes.unfortunately,it was just the beginning.
for several more years,robinson continued to experience credit problems resulting from equifax mishandling of her credit file.equifax mistakenly placed robinson address and social security number on three credit files established by the identity thief,each of which contained derogatory credit accounts the identity thief files.consequently,equifax sent various creditors requesting robinson credit report her actual credit file along with one of the identity thief files.
as a result of these errors,robinson credit problems persisted and she experienced difficulties obtaining any type of consumer credit from until.for example,in october,robinson applied for a credit card for the first time since filing for bankruptcy protection.her credit card application,however,was denied in part based on derogatory information contained in one of the identity thief files that equifax sent the credit card company.
in january,after discovering the company errors,robinson contacted equifax.the company properly combined two of robinson files into a single file,suppressed fraudulent information,and cross blocked fraudulent information so that it could not return to the file.when equifax attempted to correct these mistakes,however,the company exacerbated matters further by placing robinson identification information on another one of the identity thief files.
as a result,robinson credit problems continued and she was not able to obtain a home loan over the course of the next couple of years.in january,robinson tried to secure a home loan from a mortgage company,but she was turned down because equifax sent the mortgage company one of the identity thief files.the loan officer told robinson that he could not give her a loan until the numerous problems in her equifax credit report were corrected.chagrined that equifax had not yet corrected all of the errors in her credit report,robinson contacted equifax director of consumer affairs on february,who removed robinson identification from one of the identity thief files.
several months later,in may of,yet another error occurred when equifax,responding to a request to place a fraud alert on robinson account,inadvertently placed robinson social security number and address on another of the identity thief files.unaware of this most recent error,robinson applied for another home loan in january of.yet again,equifax sent the mortgage company her correct file along with one of the identity thief files.although the loan officer prepared a preapproval letter for robinson,he could only offer her a loan on far less advantageous terms than she might have qualified for absent equifax still inaccurate credit report.after contacting equifax to fix this most recent error,robinson applied for another mortgage in july.once again,equifax sent another one of the identity thief files to the mortgage lender.the loan officer showed robinson all of the derogatory accounts equifax was reporting,and ultimately concluded that there was no way that i could possibly help her get the loan that she was trying to get until the derogatory accounts in her equifax credit report were resolved.
to make matters worse,robinson had to spend hundreds of hours out of work trying to correct equifax mistakes.the stress of these problems weighed on robinson and the physical and emotional toll she experienced was apparent to others,particularly her family and.during this period,robinson frequently experienced headaches,sleeplessness,skin acne,upset stomach,and hair loss.
on november,several years of struggling with equifax to correct her credit filed this action against the company in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,alleging violations of the fcra and seeking actual and punitive damages.neither party filed a dispositive motion,and the case proceeded to trial.at the close of robinson case in chief,equifax moved for judgment as a matter of law,arguing that robinson had failed to present sufficient evidence to support an award of actual or punitive damages,which the district court took under advisement.equifax renewed its motion at the close of all evidence,which the district court again took under advisement.ultimately,the district court granted equifax motion with respect to punitive damages,denied the motion with respect to actual damages,and sent the case to the jury for deliberations.following deliberations,the jury awarded robinson in actual damages.thereafter,both parties filed moved for an award of attorney fees and costs,and equifax moved for a new trial.the district court denied equifax motion for a new trial and issued a memorandum opinion granting robinson approximately of her fee request,in the amount of.this appeal followed,and we possess jurisdiction under west.

equifax contends that,despite its numerous statutory violations,the jury erred in awarding robinson damages and the district court erred in awarding attorney fees we consider equifax contentions in turn.
actual damages 
equifax first argues that there was not a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found that equifax conduct resulted in robinson damages.equifax claims that the evidence robinson offered was based on pure speculation and conjecture,such that the district court erred in denying the company motion for judgment as a matter of law.we review de novo the grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.anderson russell,cir.pursuant to.a,a district court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law during a jury trial after a party has been fully heard on an issue only if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found for that party with respect to that issue.brown csx,cir citing.a.
in this case,robinson bears the burden of proving actual damages sustained as a result of equifax activities.to meet this burden,robinson proffered evidence of various damages she sustained as a result of equifax conduct,including,loss of opportunity in the home mortgage market,emotional distress,and loss of income from missing approximately hours of work addressing equifax mistakes.equifax counters that robinson did not meet her burden because she failed to establish that she was denied any credit because of an inaccuracy in an equifax credit report and presented no evidence that she sustained emotional distress proximately caused by equifax.appellant br.at.we conclude that there is more than sufficient evidence in the record connecting equifax errors with robinson damages to support the jury actual damages award.
we turn first to the evidence relating to robinson loss of opportunity in the home mortgage market.the evidence presented at trial clearly demonstrates that on numerous occasions robinson attempted to secure a home mortgage,only to be either denied outright or offered a loan on less advantageous terms than she might have received absent equifax errors.indeed,two loan officers testified that the inaccurate equifax credit reports were a substantial factor in their inability to approve robinson for a loan,and that they could not qualify her for a loan unless and until the erroneous accounts either were paid off or removed from her credit report.
likewise,we conclude that robinson proffered sufficient evidence that she suffered emotional distress as a result of equifax errors.our previous cases establish the type of evidence required to support an award for emotional damages.sloane,at.as we recently explained 
we have warned that not only is emotional distress fraught with vagueness and speculation,it is easily susceptible to fictitious and trivial claims.for this reason,although specifically recognizing that a plaintiff testimony can provide sufficient evidence to support an emotional distress award,we have required a plaintiff to reasonably and sufficiently explain the circumstances of the injury and not resort to mere conclusory statements.thus,we have distinguished between plaintiff testimony that amounts only to conclusory statements and plaintiff testimony that sufficiently articulates true demonstrable emotional distress.

in this case,robinson presented evidence that her mental distress manifested itself as headaches,sleeplessness,skin acne,upset stomach,and hair loss.moreover,the testimony of robinson friends and family members painted a detailed picture of her ongoing struggles with equifax and the emotional toll these events took upon her.illustratively,one of robinson testified that in response to her continued problems with equifax,robinson would be crying and screaming and often she was upset and stressed.another recounted that robinson only complained about equifax and that she was often visibly upset as a result of the company conduct.as her mother recalled,robinson was d istraught and there were changes in her physical appearance.there were changes in her demeanor,her interactions with her daughter and her family,and friends.
based on these incidents and our review of the entire record,it is clear that robinson sufficiently articulated and demonstrated the emotional distress she experienced as she attempted to correct equifax errors.accordingly,we conclude that there is a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found that equifax conduct resulted in robinson damages we therefore affirm the district court denial of equifax motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to actual damages 
equifax next contends that the district court committed reversible error in denying its motion for a new trial or remittitur of the actual damages award,arguing that the damages award was excessive in light of the evidence presented at trial.see cline stores,cir recognizing that a damages award must be set aside if the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence internal quotation marks omitted.we review a district court denial of a rule motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.id.at.a district court abuses its discretion by upholding an award of damages only when the jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence or based on evidence which is false.sloane,at quoting cline,at.
equifax attacks the denial of its motion for a new trial on numerous grounds,asserting,among other things,that the district court erred by submitting to the jury a general verdict form that did not separate damages for emotional distress from those for economic injury,and the district court erred by failing to overturn the excessive emotional distress award.appellant reply br.at.equifax strained arguments are unconvincing.
turning to equifax complaint regarding the verdict form the district court submitted to the jury,the parties agreed to the use of a general verdict form that did not separate damages for emotional distress from those for economic injury.indeed,the company admits that it did not raise this issue below that equifax did not object to the jury verdict form does not change the fact it was improper.reply br.at.
absent exceptional circumstances,of course,we do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.volvo const.equip,clm equip,cir.rather,we consider such issues on appeal only when the failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice.id.citing muth united states,cir.equifax has not even argued that exceptional circumstances justifying departure from the general rule are present,and based on our review of the record,we find no exceptional circumstances warranting such departure.we therefore decline to consider this argument on appeal.
perhaps looking for a way around this rule,equifax now attempts to parse the award of actual damages into economic and emotional distress damages,asserting that robinson emotional distress award should be reduced to no more than.appellant reply br.at.the jury,however,did not provide one award for emotional distress and a separate one for economic damages.rather,the jury awarded robinson a total of for all of the damages she proved at trial.consequently,and as the company acknowledges,there is no way to determine how much of the jury award is attributable to emotional damages.appellant br.at.it would be pure speculation and guesswork for us to attempt to attribute any particular portion of the jury award to emotional distress damages,and we will not engage in such an unprincipled approach 
in summary,we are convinced that the jury award is not excessive in light of the evidence presented at trial.similar to the plaintiff in sloane 
robinson did not suffer from isolated or accidental reporting errors.rather,as a victim of identity theft,she suffered the systematic manipulation of her personal information,which,despite her best efforts,equifax failed to correct over a protracted period of time.of course,equifax bore no responsibility for the initial theft,but the fcra makes the company responsible for taking reasonable steps to correct robinson credit report once she brought the theft to the company attention this equifax utterly failed to do.
sloane,at.against this backdrop,we conclude that the district court was well within its discretion in sustaining the award of in actual damages against equifax.
attorney fees 
finally,equifax challenges the district court judgment awarding robinson in attorney fees and costs.the fcra provides that a prevailing plaintiff is entitled to the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.a.because robinson obtained relief on her fcra claims,equifax does not di
