koons buick pontiac gmc,appeals a district court order commanding koons to pay bradley nigh in attorneys fees incurred in protracted litigation between the two parties.nigh was successful at trial and before us on appeal,but he lost a dispute regarding a statutory damage cap when koons appealed our ruling to the supreme court.koons contends that nigh no longer deserves costs or attorneys fees,or at least,does not deserve fees for the work done in connection with the supreme court appeal and subsequent proceedings.
nigh filed suit against koons in october,alleging conversion,breach of contract,fraud,and violations of the federal odometer act,truth in lending act tila,and virginia consumer protection act vcpa.the district court dismissed most of nigh claims on motion for summary judgment,but a jury ultimately returned a verdict for nigh under the tila and the vcpa.koons appealed its liability and the amount of damages,costs,and attorneys fees awarded to nigh.nigh,arguing that the district court erroneously dismissed two of his claims on summary judgment.we affirmed the district court judgment in all respects,nigh koons buick pontiac gmc,cir,and awarded nigh an additional in attorneys fees for work performed on the appeal.
koons appealed to the supreme court,which reviewed only the amount of damages awarded under the tila.the court agreed with koons that the tila capped nigh damages,then,at.koons buick pontiac gmc,nigh,d.the court remanded the case to us,and we to the district court.koons promptly petitioned us for rehearing,noting that we failed to address the issue of attorneys fees in our remand order.over nigh objection,we granted the petition,vacated all prior awards of attorneys fees,and remanded for a new determination of fees as well.
on remand,the district court reinstated the attorneys fees awarded for work done up to and including the initial appeal to this court.nigh koons buick pontiac gmc,d.the court further awarded nigh for the work done in connection with the supreme court appeal,for work on remand to this court,and for work before the district court in connection with the motion on which the court was then ruling.id.the court also reaffirmed its initial award to nigh of in costs.id.in total,koons was ordered to pay nigh.id.at.
the tila requires that a defendant pay costs and reasonable attorneys fees to any person who brings a successful action to enforce liability under the tila against that defendant.see a the language is imperative costs and reasonable fees must be awarded to a plaintiff who brings a successful action.the only variable in the calculation is the amount of attorneys fees,the determination of which is left to the discretion of the district court with the stipulation that the fees be reasonable.see de jesus banco popular de puerto rico,cir see also doe chao,cir discussing the provision of the federal privacy act.in this case,nigh brought a successful action,so koons must pay him costs and reasonable attorneys fees.
as it is used in a,action encompasses each stage of nigh litigation,including the supreme court appeal and all the proceedings that followed.the tila does not define action,but its context makes its meaning plain an action is a lawsuit.when dealing with similar language in title vii of the civil rights act of,we acknowledged that,in its usual sense,action is synonymous with a suit brought in a court.chris tenet,cir citing black law dictionary deluxe ed.it has been,apparently,since at least.see oxford english dictionary ed defining action as a legal process or suit.an action constitutes more than an individual appearance before one particular tribunal.in ordinary usage,an civil action,at with the filing of a complaint and ends when no party may any longer obtain review of the final disposition of the case,encompassing all steps necessary in between.we casually equate action with suit quite often we did so earlier in this very litigation.describing the initiation of the lawsuit,but also referring to the legal dispute before us at the time,we said nigh,claiming that koons buick defrauded him,brought this action under the statutory authority of the tila nigh,at.this common understanding of action is consistent with a,and we need look no further for the word import,see united states ron pair,d.
defining action in this way means it is possible for a tila plaintiff to obtain attorneys fees for a stage of the litigation at which she does not prevail.if a plaintiff does not prevail before the district court,but later is determined to have successfully demonstrated a defendant liability,her action is successful,and she may recover fees for work done at the trial level.see,gibson ltd,cir because gibson has been successful on three tila claims,not just the two found by the district court,we vacate the district court award of attorneys fees and remand to permit the court to reassess its award in view of these changed circumstances.conversely,if an appellate court overturns a district court finding of liability under the tila,the plaintiff action is not successful,and she is not entitled to fees for either stage of the litigation.
in this case,nigh action was successful.true,many of the claims he originally brought were dismissed,but a jury found koons liable to nigh under the tila,and its finding has not been upset by any court since.nigh recovered not a trifle,but the maximum amount permissible under the statute.simply put,nigh is the prevailing party.see buckhannon bd.and care home.dep t of health and human,d farrar hobby,d griggs dupont de nemours,cir.the tila does not award fees and costs to prevailing parties,of course.at least,it does not do so explicitly.rather,the act awards fees and costs to victims of tila violations who bring successful actions against the violators.a.but there is little reason to suppose that a successful action is anything more or less than an action brought by a prevailing party.see dechert cadle,cir see also ruckelshaus sierra club,d grouping statutes that award fees for successful actions together with statutes that award fees to prevailing or substantially prevailing parties.just as a plaintiff can prevail when only one of his claims succeeds,so his action can succeed when only one of its constituent claims prevails.nigh action,then,was successful.even so,nigh is not necessarily entitled to have all his litigation expenses reimbursed.he is owed only costs and reasonable attorneys fees 
costs are simple enough.in august,after we issued our first opinion in this case,the district court awarded nigh in costs.following the supreme court proceedings,we granted koons petition for rehearing regarding attorneys fees and costs,vacated the fee awards,and remanded the case to the district court for a reassessment of fees.we did not vacate the award of costs.at koons behest,the district court reconsidered the award anyway,but decided to reaffirm it.nigh,d at.koons now asks us to vacate or at least substantially reduce the award,which we will not do.koons supplies no reason for us to believe the district court flubbed its calculation of costs in the first instance,and nothing about the succeeding litigation has changed the nature of the trial or initial appeal such that nigh should no longer be entitled to litigation costs for those proceedings.he brought a successful tila action and therefore is entitled to costs.see a.the district court award of in costs is affirmed.
the question of reasonable fees is more complicated.as a preliminary matter,we affirm the reinstatement of for attorneys fees amassed during the initial fourth circuit appeal.despite koons supreme court success in the dispute,the fourth circuit fee award remains reasonable.we awarded nigh only about percent of the fees he sought for the fourth circuit work because his was unsuccessful.nigh devoted a scant four pages of his appellate briefs in that proceeding to argument about the tila damage cap.of course,that argument turned out to be unsuccessful as well.see koons,at.an additional reduction in fees to reflect koons ultimate vindication on the question may well have been appropriate,but we can not say the district court ab
