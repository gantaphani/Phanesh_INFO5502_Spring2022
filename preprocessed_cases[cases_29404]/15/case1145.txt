the defendant,waterhouse securities,appeals the judgment of the appellate court affirming in part and reversing in part the trial court order on waterhouse securities motion to strike plaintiff mark weiss class action allegations and compel arbitration.weiss has filed a motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
accordingly,there are two central issues in this case whether we have jurisdiction to hear waterhouse securities interlocutory appeal,and,if so,whether the appellate court correctly held that weiss class action allegations are sufficient as a matter of law to survive waterhouse securities motion to strike.for the reasons that follow,we deny weiss motion to dismiss this appeal and affirm the appellate court.
background 
in october,weiss opened a webbroker account with waterhouse securities,a discount securities brokerage company.with this account and waterhouse securities help,he hoped to trade securities on his personal computer,by telephone,or through an assigned broker.the waterhouse securities account agreement booklet governing weiss account contained an arbitration clause,which provided in part 
i agree that any controversy relating to any of my accounts or any agreement that i have with waterhouse securities will be submitted to arbitration conducted only under the provisions of the constitution and rules of the new york stock exchange,nyse or pursuant to the code of the arbitration of the national association of securities dealers,nasd no person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration,nor seek to enforce any arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action,or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until i the class certification is denied or ii the class is decertified or iii the customer is excluded from the class by the court.
weiss soon encountered problems accessing his account,both online and by telephone.on january,he filed a class action complaint against waterhouse securities on behalf of more than million of its customers,asserting claims for violation of the consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act ilcs et west,breach of contract,and fraud.on february,waterhouse securities removed the cause to federal court,but the united states district court for the northern district of illinois remanded the cause back to the cook county circuit court.more than six months later,on august,waterhouse securities filed a motion to dismiss under section of the code of civil procedure ilcs a west in lieu of an answer.waterhouse securities contended that the agreement with weiss disclosed the possibility that he might experience interruptions or delays in accessing his account,disclaimed any liability for damages incurred from such service interruptions or delays,and contained a choice of law provision which barred his claim under the consumer fraud act.the trial court denied this motion on april.
on april,waterhouse securities responded to weiss initial interrogatories and production requests.waterhouse securities responses included general objections to weiss initial discovery efforts as 
premature,unreasonable,unduly burdensome,oppressive,and seeking potentially unnecessary and wasteful discovery to the extent a that they seek documents information prior to the disposition of waterhouse pending motion to dismiss this action b that they seek documents information regarding the merits of weiss claims and the claims of the purported class prior to the disposition of a motion for class certification and c that such discovery may be improper impermissible under the illinois uniform arbitration act,ilcs et,and the parties agreement to arbitrate this dispute,in the event that both the motion to dismiss and motion for class certification are denied.
waterhouse securities individually objected to of weiss interrogatories.it responded to interrogatories regarding potential fact and opinion witnesses by indicating that it had not determined what witnesses to call at trial and would supplement its answers in due time.
waterhouse securities also objected to of weiss production requests,stating that it would produce only all responsive documents relating to weiss himself.on april,weiss attorney sent waterhouse securities attorney a supreme court rule k letter see k attempting to resolve this discovery dispute.waterhouse securities attorney responded to this letter on may,repeating and detailing waterhouse securities objections to weiss discovery efforts and signaling its intention to file a motion to strike the class allegations and compel arbitration.
on may,waterhouse securities filed such a motion,specifically asking the trial court for an order striking the class allegations from the complaint pursuant to ilcs west and compelling plaintiff individual claims to arbitration.waterhouse securities argued that weiss class action claims could not be certified because common issues of fact and law do not predominate and,therefore,asked that weiss individual claims be sent to arbitration,pursuant to the agreement.waterhouse securities conceded that the motion to compel was contingent on the trial court granting the motion to strike.while this motion was being briefed,weiss filed a motion to compel discovery on august.waterhouse securities responded to this motion on november,reiterating its objections to weiss discovery efforts as an enormous burden.the motion to compel remains pending.
on january,the trial court decided waterhouse securities motion to strike and compel.the trial court order opened by noting,this matter is before the court on defendant waterhouse securities,motion to strike class allegations,omitting any reference to the arbitration request.the order then stated that common questions of law and fact predominate over questions involving individual class members so that the class allegations as set forth by weiss are sufficient as a matter of law.the order closed by holding,it is hereby adjudged,ordered and decreed that defendant motion to strike class allegations and compel arbitration is denied.emphasis added.
waterhouse securities appealed pursuant to supreme court rule a a,which allows interlocutory appeals of orders denying injunctive relief.waterhouse securities claimed that because the trial court order denied a motion to compel arbitration,that order was appealable under notaro.in an unpublished order,the appellate court disputed waterhouse securities characterization of the trial court order.the appellate court stated that waterhouse securities had,in effect,filed two separate motions a motion to dismiss weiss class action allegations under section a of the code of civil procedure see ilcs a west and a motion to compel arbitration of his individual claims 
given the nature of waterhouse motion,the court was initially forced to consider the legal sufficiency of plaintiff class action allegations.the court did that and,upon finding the class allegations adequate,denied waterhouse request to compel arbitration.hence,the court order constitutes two distinct ruling denying waterhouse request for dismissal under section and another ruling denying waterhouse motion to compel arbitration.unpublished order under supreme court rule.
the appellate court held it lacked jurisdiction over the trial court order denying the first motion because that order was interlocutory and not appealable.the appellate court,however,decided that it had jurisdiction over the second motion under rule a.because none of the arbitration conditions in the agreement had been met,the appellate court affirmed the trial court order denying waterhouse securities motion to compel arbitration.
waterhouse securities appealed to this court.we denied its petition for leave to appeal,but vacated the appellate court order,directing that court to reconsider its judgment,including the propriety of the trial court order denying defendant motion to strike class allegations.see weiss waterhouse securities,supervisory order.
on remand,the appellate court affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.d.as an initial matter,the court addressed its jurisdiction and repeated its statements that,essentially,waterhouse securities filed two motion to strike and a motion to that,consequently,the trial court made two rulings.the court concluded,however,while an order denying a motion for dismissal is not a final and appealable determination but,rather,is interlocutory in nature citations,we nonetheless have jurisdiction to review the circuit court denial of waterhouse motion to strike because that motion was a necessary and attendant part of the court refusal to compel arbitration.d at.
on the merits,the appellate court noted that illinois law is not clear about the extent to which a putative class action plaintiff must plead the requirements in section.d at.the court concluded 
a representative plaintiff is not required to allege all the details necessary to establish that his class action is maintainable pursuant to section in bringing a claim or claims as a class action.rather,the plaintiff need only allege a viable individual cause of action,indicate that the claim is being brought as a class action lawsuit,and contain factual allegations that are broad enough in scope to establish the possible existence of a class action suit as contemplated by section.if there is no possibility that a claim can be maintained as a class action,then dismissal of the class action allegations is proper pursuant to section.on the other hand,if there is any possibility that a class action can be maintained for some members of a class,dismissal under section is not warranted.
in determining whether a complaint brought as a class action is legally sufficient under section,the circuit court should not inquire into whether the factual allegations establish the statutory prerequisites for maintaining a class action litigation.whether the statutory prerequisites for a class action exists sic in a case should be decided only when the issue of certification is specifically raised before the circuit court.a motion for certification and a motion to dismiss under section are not the same thing and involve separate and distinct inquiries.d at.
the court held that weiss complaint sufficiently stated a class action the complaint alleges that plaintiff and a number of other waterhouse customers shared difficulties in using waterhouse trading services during the class period.taking the complaint allegations as true,the possibility that plaintiff claims can be maintained as a class action can not be ruled out.d at.the court,however,expressed no opinion on whether the complaint would survive a certification hearing.d at.
turning to waterhouse securities second motion,the motion to compel,the appellate court stated,the issue of certification was never properly before the circuit court.d at.none of the conditions triggering arbitration had occurred thus,t he issue of whether plaintiff individual claims should be compelled to arbitration,therefore,was not ripe for the circuit court determination and,accordingly,the court decision denying waterhouse motion to compel was premature.d at.the court affirmed that portion of the trial court order denying waterhouse securities motion to dismiss and reversed those portions of the order finding common questions predominated and denying its motion to compel.d at.
waterhouse securities again appealed to this court,and we granted its second petition for leave to appeal.see a.we granted the chamber of commerce of the united states of america leave to file a brief as amicus curiae in support of waterhouse securities.see.weiss filed a motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.we took this motion with the case.
before proceeding to the merits of this appeal,we must initially decide weiss motion to dismiss.weiss argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the trial court order denying waterhouse securities motion to strike because that was an unappealable interlocutory order.weiss further argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the issues raised by waterhouse securities motion to compel because the trial court never ruled on that motion.according to weiss,the court order was limited to the motion to strike.even if the court had ruled on the motion to compel,weiss contends,waterhouse securities can not bootstrap an unappealable interlocutory order onto the admittedly appealable interlocutory order on the motion to compel.
waterhouse securities answers that this jurisdictional issue was raised by weiss in response to waterhouse securities first petition for leave to appeal,and thus was previously considered by this court in its supervisory order to the appellate court.according to waterhouse securities,this court order essentially conferred jurisdiction,and this ruling has become the law of the case.further,waterhouse securities argues that the validity of the trial court ruling on the motion to compel depended upon the validity of its ruling on the motion to strike.
we agree with waterhouse securities.by ordering the appellate court to review the propriety of the trial court order denying the motion to strike,we decided that the appellate court had jurisdiction.our earlier decision is now the law of the case.see people tenner.additionally,the appellate court was right the decisions on the motion to strike and the motion to compel were intertwined.that is,the validity of any order on the motion to strike class allegations determined the validity of any order on the motion to compel arbitration,and the order denying the motion to compel arbitration was appealable under rule a.see notaro,at,federal signal slc technologies,d.
waterhouse securities could have chosen a procedurally cleaner route by filing only a motion to strike.if that motion were granted,waterhouse securities then could have filed a separate motion to compel arbitration.if the motion to strike were denied,waterhouse securities then could have sought a finding under rule a a,making an interlocutory order appealable,or pursued a appeal under rule see,mccarthy la salle national bank trust,d,elder coronet insurance,d.the route waterhouse securities followed,however,was not improper.we need not force a litigant to file two motions when the ruling on the motion to compel would be a foregone conclusion after the ruling on the motion to strike.we turn to the merits of this interlocutory appeal.
waterhouse securities contends that the appellate court erred in concluding that the trial court should not inquire whether the plaintiff complaint establishes the statutory class action prerequisites.waterhouse securities asserts in its brief,no than the appellate court in this ever held that a motion to strike class allegations pursuant to sections and was somehow procedurally improper.waterhouse securities,however,ignores the fact that its motion to strike and dismiss refers only to section,which provides the prerequisites for class certification it does not refer to section a,or to section of the uniform arbitration act ilcs west proceedings to compel or stay arbitration.more importantly,waterhouse securities misreads the appellate court opinion.the appellate court never held that defendants can no longer file motions to strike class allegations.in fact,as weiss correctly notes,the appellate court acknowledged that class action allegations may properly be dismissed i f there is no possibility that a claim can be maintained as a class action.d at.this holding is consistent with precedent.
though the class action statute itself does not require the plaintiff to plead facts establishing the class action prerequisites arriola time insurance,d,illinois courts have consistently recognized that a class action complaint should be dismissed at the pleading stage if the complaint fails to meet the statutory requirements for class certification bruemmer compaq computer,d,citing mccabe burgess.notably,in our first opinion construing the statutory class action provisions,we held that,in reviewing the dismissal of a class action,we shall measure this action in terms of the statute.steinberg chicago medical school,accord barliant follett,the question,then,is
