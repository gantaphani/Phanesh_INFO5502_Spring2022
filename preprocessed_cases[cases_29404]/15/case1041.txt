factual and procedural background 
the facts,as we summarize them,are not disputed except where noted.
until their bankruptcy in,the maloofs operated a wholesale automobile business.starting in,they maintained a savings account,business checking account,and a line of credit with arrowhead.
in march,auto loan submitted a credit reference request to arrowhead.the spare form had separate sections for responding about the checking account,savings account,and credit relationship.in a single introductory paragraph,the form announced your firm name has been furnished as a credit reference for the customer whose name and address appears below.we would appreciate any information you could provide regarding this customer credit history with you.we assure you that any information provided will remain confidential and will be used only by our credit department.
joanna avalos,an arrowhead information specialist,completed the form.as to the checking account,for average balance,she checked the boxes low and five figures.for experience,she checked satisfactory.as to the savings account,she checked the box for low average balance and,for number of nsfs or returns,she wrote na or not applicable.she described an approved unsecured credit line of as satisfactory.
in october,auto loan submitted a different request to arrowhead.it contained the same introductory paragraph.barbara gronek,an arrowhead credit analyst,completed the form.she described the maloofs deposit accounts,checking and savings,as generally satisfactory,rather than excellent or satisfactory.the secured credit line and loan was generally satisfied but approved credit was listed as only.gronek admitted the latter figure was an error.
in december,sylvia jiminez,a clerk in arrowhead commercial lending department completed a third credit reference,again containing the introductory paragraph,for the maloofs,stating that payment was usually received in days and the account was satisfactory.
auto loan contends that,based on arrowhead credit references,in april,it entered into a loan and security agreement with the maloofs and,in february,auto loan purchased of commercial paper issued by the maloofs.by june,auto loan had extended credit of to the maloofs.in november,arrowhead returned bad checks written by the maloofs totaling to auto loan.auto loan claims ultimate losses of.
in june,auto loan filed a first amended complaint against arrowhead for various causes of action based on fraud.in february,arrowhead filed a motion for summary judgment directed at all five causes of action of the first amended complaint.
in response,auto loan filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint by adding three causes of action for negligence and constructive fraud.
in opposition to arrowhead summary judgment motion,auto loan filed a responsive statement of facts in which it asserts that,despite the generally positive nature of the credit references given by arrowhead about the maloofs credit union accounts,they had nsf checks,checks drawn on accounts with insufficient funds in and nsf checks in.arrowhead regularly allowed the maloofs to operate with large overdrafts while charging them nsf fees.in october,the maloofs checking account showed a negative monthly balance of.in february,an arrowhead senior,anne benjamin,wrote a memorandum stating she was extremely concerned about the account and threatening to close it.the response of dan jiminez,the account supervisor,was that the maloofs business had increased so rapidly it had caused an increase in the overdrafts.nevertheless,arrowhead asserted that the maloofs were satisfactory business customers because they always made deposits sufficient to cover their checks.
then,and later in opposition to the second summary judgment motion,auto loan submitted another separate set of facts,mostly disputed by arrowhead,the gist of which was that arrowhead supplied inaccurate credit references in spite of the maloofs poor credit history and that arrowhead did not have adequate policies to cover giving credit references.
whereas arrowhead contended in its motion it did not know specifically why auto loan was making credit inquiries,auto loan insisted arrowhead had to know auto loan was planning to grant credit,maintain existing credit,or expand existing credit.
arrowhead also contended the facts did not show actionable reliance by auto loan and that auto loan did not diligently perform its own credit investigation and inquiry about the maloofs.auto loan disagreed and accused dan jiminez,who was personal friends with the maloofs,of assisting the maloofs improperly.auto loan further maintained arrowhead was trying to protect its own investment by keeping the maloofs solvent with auto loan providing financing.
in april,the court granted auto loan leave to file the second amended complaint and granted arrowhead original summary judgment motion as a summary adjudication of all causes of action of the first amended complaint.
arrowhead then filed a demurrer,a motion to strike,and a second summary adjudication motion,attacking the remaining allegations of the second amended complaint.the court ruling on those motions decided the balance of the case.
in connection with arrowhead second summary motion,auto loan tried to submit evidence,in the form of an expert declaration from william gormley,that arrowhead should have considered the number of nsf checks generated by the maloofs when it gave them a satisfactory credit reference.according to gormley,in banking parlance satisfactory means a customer generates few or no overdrafts and arrowhead should not have given the maloofs a satisfactory credit reference.therefore,according to auto loan,there exists a factual dispute about whether the credit references were false and misleading.the court,however,refused to consider the gormley declaration.auto loan also tried to present a plethora of evidence to show it could not have and did not need to conduct an independent investigation of the maloofs creditworthiness that might have discovered they were not a good credit risk.
auto loan presented additional evidence that,in april and april,jiminez approved without proper authority a line of credit for the maloofs and that arrowhead made a practice of allowing the maloofs to operate with substantial overdrafts.some arrowhead employees acknowledged the credit references were not accurate.arrowhead also gave inaccurate credit references to other maloof creditors.
in finding in favor of arrowhead,the trial court ruled there was no evidence arrowhead acted fraudulently and its opinion when supplying credit references was not actionable negligence.on appeal,auto loan contends arrowhead had a duty to be accurate when responding to credit inquiries.
