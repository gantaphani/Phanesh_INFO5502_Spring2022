this appeal is from a judgment in an approximately member class action.we consider whether the decision of experian information solutions,experian to list a defunct credit card company,rather than the name of its servicer,as a source of information on an individual credit report without more creates sufficient injury in fact under the fair credit reporting act fcra for purposes of article iii standing.a.
we conclude that where an individual fails to allege a concrete injury stemming from allegedly incomplete or incorrect information listed on a credit report,he or she can not satisfy the threshold requirements of constitutional standing.here,we discern no concrete injury on behalf of the named plaintiff.therefore,we vacate and remand with instructions that the case be dismissed.
in,michael dreher was undergoing a background check for a security clearance when the federal government discovered he was associated with a delinquent credit card account.dreher cousin had taken out the credit card in dreher name to cover expenses for a failing bowling alley to clear up the matter,dreher requested credit reports from three credit agencies,including experian.dreher received a series of experian credit reports,which listed a delinquent account under the names advanta bank or advanta credit cards collectively,advanta and provided pennsylvania and new york box addresses,
thereafter,in early,dreher sent letters to advanta.first,in march,he requested some verification that he owed this debt,and receiving no response,he sent another letter on april,which was similar in content.dreher then received a response on advanta letterhead dated april,with a march statement showing an outstanding balance of,along with the online credit card application bearing dreher name and social security number.on may,dreher sent a correspondence instructing advanta to delete the inaccurate information from his credit files.id.again receiving no response,he lost hope that advanta would fix their mistake.id.he contacted experian directly about the issue,but still his credit report listed the delinquent advanta account.according to dreher,this process caused additional stress and wasted hours of his time.id.at.it did not,however,affect his security clearance in fact,based on dreher representation that he was paying down the balance,the government approved his clearance,which took a total of eight days to process.the advanta account was finally deleted from dreher credit file on june.stipulation at,dreher experian infos,filed,ecf.
unbeknownst to dreher,in early,the utah department of financial institutions had closed advanta,which had failed to withstand the financial crisis,and named the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as receiver.deutsche bank trust company deutsche bank received a security interest in advanta receivables and appointed cardworks,and cardworks servicing llc collectively,cardworks as servicer of advanta portfolio,effective august.this meant that cardworks would respond to credit card customer complaints and effect compromises and settlements of ongoing credit card customer disputes.in its capacity as advanta servicer,cardworks decided to do business using the advanta name,the phone number advanta used prior to august,and the advanta website,with the goal of mak ing the servicing transfer seem as innocuous as possible.id.
cardworks then had to decide how to list advanta accounts,or tradelines on consumer credit reports.on october,tom wineland,a asset manager for the fdic,signed a letter to experian agreeing that the tradeline appearing for all advanta accounts on experian credit reports should bear the advanta name.authorized representatives from cardworks and the former advanta bank also signed the letter.wineland explained that he agreed to using the advanta moniker because the successor creditor of the advanta accounts,deutsche bank,remained the same after advanta was placed in receivership in addition,advanta credit cards was the name least confusing to cardholders who a might not recognize the new servicer of their credit accounts represented in the tradelines,and b would continue to access their accounts and make payments at the advanta website.using the name of the initial creditor also comported with experian common practice to utilize an associated subscriber name that will assist consumers to recognize the accounts and enable consumers to correct any inaccuracies or lodge disputes if necessary.id.at.
on september,dreher individually sued experian and cardworks in the eastern district of virginia he later amended his complaint to assert three class claims and seven individual claims on the basis that,inter alia,experian willfully violated the fcra by failing to include the name cardworks in the advanta tradelines on its credit reports.on october,experian moved for partial summary judgment on dreher class claims,arguing that dreher did not produce evidence of willfulness as required under the fcra.on may,the district court denied the motion.it later certified the class to include 
a ll natural persons who requested a copy of their consumer disclosure from experian on or after august,received a document in response that identified advanta bank or advanta credit cards as the only source of the information for the tradeline and whose date of status or last reported field reflected a date of august or later.
on july,experian filed a petition for permission to bring an interlocutory appeal on the certification issue,which this court denied.see order,experian info,cir.filed,ecf.
the parties then filed for partial summary judgment on october,wherein experian argued that dreher and the class members lacked article iii standing,and dreher argued experian willfully violated the fcra.the district court granted dreher motion,concluding as a matter of law that experian committed a willful violation of the fcra,because n o jury could find experian intentional omission of cardworks was objectively reasonable,id.at.in turn,it denied experian motion,reasoning that the fcra creates a statutory right to receive the sources of information for one credit report,and when a credit reporting agency fails to disclose those sources,it violates that right,thus creating a sufficient for constitutional standing.id.at.the district court did not analyze whether the injury was specific and concrete.instead,it concluded that any violation of the statute sufficed to create an article iii injury in fact.however,the district court also recognized this order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and an immediate appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.id.at.experian again attempted to lodge an interlocutory appeal with this court,to no avail.see order,experian info.sols.dreher,cir.filed,ecf.
in february,the district court severed the class claim from the individual claims for separate jury trials.rather than hold a jury trial on statutory and punitive damages on the class claim dreher did not seek actual damages,the parties stipulated to an award of in statutory damages for each class member and no punitive damages.on august,the district court entered final judgment on behalf of dreher and the class in the amount of per class member,totaling over million experian timely noted this appeal,and we held the case in abeyance pending the united states supreme court decision in spokeo,robins,which was decided in may of.
