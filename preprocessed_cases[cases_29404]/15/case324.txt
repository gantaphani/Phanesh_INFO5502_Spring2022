this case arises from the debtors bankruptcy filed under chapter on april,and the united states trustee motion to dismiss for substantial abuse filed under b on july.the issue presented on appeal is whether a bankruptcy court should consider events in deciding whether to dismiss a case for substantial abuse under b.the bankruptcy court determined that events should not be considered,and the district court reversed,holding that such circumstances should be considered in determining substantial abuse.based on the version of b that applied to cases filed before the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,we affirm the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court with instructions to remand it to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual and procedural history 
on april,carlos vicente cortez and suzanne hallman cortez collectively,the cortezes jointly filed for bankruptcy under chapter.in addition to their voluntary petition,the cortezes filed their schedules,showing one secured claim in the amount of on their homestead and unsecured debt in the amount of,the majority of which consisted of credit card debt.schedule i listed the cortezes net income as per month,and schedule j listed the cortezes total expenses as per month.at that time,cortez was unemployed and cortez was employed as a registered nurse,so all of the income listed on schedule i was attributable to cortez 
at the bottom of schedule i,debtors are instructed to d escribe any increase or decrease of more than in any of the above categories anticipated to occur within the year following the filing of this document.in response,the cortezes disclosed that cortez believes he will be employed this month,but he has not started working yet.
on april,four days after the cortezes filed for chapter,cortez was offered a position with aramark healthcare management services aramark as the human resource director.cortez accepted the position and began working for aramark on april.as the human resource director,cortez earned an annual salary of,making his net income per month,and received a signing bonus after sixty days of employment.cortez was also eligible to receive a company car.
after cortez began working for aramark,cortez reduced her hours so that her net income as of october,was approximately per month.with cortez new job and cortez reduced hours,the cortezes net income was per month,exceeding their expenses by per month.the cortezes provided documents to the united states trustee trustee showing that cortez was employed by aramark and testified to the same at the meeting of the creditors on may.
on july,the trustee filed a motion to dismiss under b,asserting that the cortezes appear to have the means to repay a substantial portion of their debts through a chapter plan,given that the cortezes income now exceeded their expenses by per month,and that it would therefore be a substantial abuse to grant the cortezes relief under chapter.on july,the cortezes filed their response,contending that cortez was unemployed at the time they filed their chapter petition and that it was inappropriate for the court to consider events,including cortez employment with aramark,in deciding whether to dismiss their case under b.
bankruptcy court decision 
on november,the bankruptcy court denied the trustee motion to dismiss,concluding that events should not be considered in deciding whether to dismiss a case under section b unless the events were clearly in prospect at the time of filing for bankruptcy.relying on in re pier,the bankruptcy court interpreted the phrase granting of relief in b to mean an order for relief,which occurs at the commencement of the case,under.the bankruptcy court reasoned that its analysis must therefore focus on whether the order for relief granted on the petition date by operation of section was proper,not whether substantial abuse would occur if the court were to grant that same relief for the first time today.the bankruptcy court concluded that it was barred from considering facts that arose after the commencement of the case in deciding substantial abuse under b.in other words,the bankruptcy court determined that it could consider the circumstances only as they existed on the petition date,including anticipating events known to be in prospect at the time of filing.
the bankruptcy court explained that using the date of filing for deciding whether substantial abuse exists was consistent not only with the language of and b,but also with the bankruptcy code general policy of using the filing date to determine a party rights in a bankruptcy case.the bankruptcy court pointed out that the automatic stay under,the debtor entitlement to exemptions under,and the determination of secured claims under,among other code provisions,all use the petition date as the point of reference.
applying its interpretation of b to the cortezes case,the bankruptcy court found that cortez employment could not be considered because it was not an event clearly in prospect at the petition date given that it could not consider cortez improvements in earnings,the bankruptcy court concluded that the debtors did not have the ability to fund a chapter plan and therefore denied the trustee motion to dismiss.
district court decision 
on march,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court order,holding that the language of b makes clear t hat events are to be taken into account in ruling on a motion under b.the district court explained that b specifically instructs courts not to consider whether a debtor has made,or continues to make,charitable contributions.the district court reasoned that the fact that no other limitations are placed on the court in ruling on such motions provides sufficient support for its conclusion that the text of b takes events into account,except to the extent that the debtor continues to make charitable contributions.
the district court also distinguished in re pier,the primary case the bankruptcy court relied on in its interpretation of b,as standing for the proposition that a later change in circumstances will not necessarily save a bankruptcy whose original filing was a substantial abuse of the provisions of chapter.the district court explained that 
s uch is not the case here,where the issue is whether debtors have the ability to make significant payments to their creditors from future income.moreover,there was no need for the bankruptcy court to rely on pier in making a case for assessing a b motion as of the time of filing of a petition.all of the pertinent authorities implicitly,if not explicitly,recognize that a debtor current and future expected income is to be taken into account in determining whether the debtor is in need of chapter relief.

subsequent proceedings 
on march,while the case was on appeal to the district court,cortez lost his job at aramark.the cortezes contend that the district court was unable to consider cortez job loss because the district court issued its order and final judgment on march,without oral argument and before the cortezes could file a reply brief advising the district court of their change in financial circumstances.as of may,cortez was still unemployed.
on april,the cortezes filed this appeal,arguing that the district court erred in concluding that b takes into account events,and the district court erred in limiting the bankruptcy court ability to consider additional changes on remand,such as cortez job loss and current unemployment.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
before addressing the merits of this dispute,we first must consider whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.although neither party raised the issue before this court,we are obligated to examine the basis for our jurisdiction,sua sponte,if necessary.chunn chunn in re chunn,cir quoting williams chater,cir.
we have jurisdiction to hear appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees in bankruptcy matters entered under a and b.d see also andrews kurth family snacks,in re,cir observing that this court is limited to reviewing only final orders under d.w hen a district court sitting as a court of appeals in bankruptcy remands a case to the bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings,the remand order is not final and therefore not appealable under d.conroe office.nichols in re nichols,cir.
in determining what constitutes significant further proceedings,we distinguish between those remands requiring the bankruptcy court to perform judicial functions and those requiring mere ministerial functions.see beal bank,caddo,in re caddo,cir.remands that require the bankruptcy court to perform judicial functions,such as additional,are not final orders and,therefore,are not appealable to this court.see aegis specialty,ferlita in re aegis specialty,cir.however,if the remand involves only ministerial proceedings,such as the entry of an order by the bankruptcy court in accordance with the district court decision,then the order should be considered final.in re caddo,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in this case,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court order denying the trustee motion to dismiss under b,and remanded the case to the bankruptcy court to allow the cortezes to take action to convert to a chapter proceeding within ten days from the date of this order otherwise,the bankruptcy court is instructed to dismiss the proceeding.we are satisfied that this remand order leaves only ministerial tasks for the bankruptcy court and therefore constitutes a final order under d.see in re,at concluding that jurisdiction exists under d where t he district court remand order neither necessitates further nor the use of substantial discretion on the part of the bankruptcy court see also in re caddo,at stating that a remand order is final if all that remains to do on remand is purely mechanical or mere entry of an order in accordance with the district court decision.because we conclude that we have jurisdiction pursuant to d,we turn to the merits of this appeal.
construction of b 
this case,one of first impression in this circuit,requires us to determine whether dismissal for substantial abuse in b includes a consideration of events,a question of law that we review de novo.see sec.state bank irs in re van gerpen,cir.section b,in relevant part,provides that 
the court,on its own motion or on a motion by the united states trustee,may dismiss a case filed by an individual debtor under this chapter whose debts are primarily consumer debts if it finds that the granting of relief would be a substantial abuse of the provisions of this chapter in making a determination whether to dismiss a case under this section,the court may not take into consideration whether a debtor has made,or continues to make,charitable contributions 
b whether subsequent improvements in the debtor earnings warrant dismissal is not directly answered by the text itself still,as with any statutory analysis,we begin with the words of the statute,keeping in mind that the meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context.brown gardner,d quoting king vincent,d citing shell oil iowa dep t of revenue,d.
the statute conditions dismissal on a finding that the granting of relief would be a substantial abuse of the provisions of this chapter.b.although granting of relief is undefined,its context reveals that it is referring to a chapter discharge,and not the relief associated with the commencement of the case under.first,the phrase provisions of this chapter refers to chapter,the chapter in which b is located.section,the relief under chapter,discharges the debtor from all debts that arose before the filing of the petition.see id.b.that granting of relief means a discharge under and not an order for relief under is also evident from the use of the words would be following granting of relief,indicating that the relief is to take place sometime in the future.this interpretation is consistent with the bankruptcy procedural rules,which delay granting a discharge when a motion to dismiss under b is pending.see fed.c d.finally,the courts of appeals considering b have implicitly,if not explicitly,recognized that granting of relief means a chapter discharge.see first usa lamanna in re lamanna,cir section b was enacted to impose a restraint on consumer debtors access to chapter discharge by interposing bankruptcy courts as gatekeepers who could examine the worthiness of debtor petitions and dismiss those petitions deemed abusive.emphasis added trustee harris in re harris,cir stating that b permits the bankruptcy court to dismiss a chapter seven proceeding if it finds that granting a discharge would be a substantial abuse of the provisions of this chapter emphasis added see also collier on bankruptcy a ed.in determining whether a substantial abuse exists,there is a presumption in favor of granting the relief sought by the debtor,a discharge.therefore,we think that the granting of relief in b is referring to the relief associated with chapter,the discharge of all debts under,and not the relief associated with the commencement of the case under 
section b does not condition dismissal on the filing of bankruptcy being a substantial abuse but rather on the granting of relief,which suggests that in determining whether to dismiss under b,a court may act on the basis of any development occurring before the discharge is granted.other language in b supports this view and indicates that a substantial abuse determination is forward looking.the last sentence in b states that i n making a determination whether to dismiss a case under this section,the court may not take into consideration whether a debtor has made,or continues to make,charitable contributions b emphasis added.in other words,b expressly instructs the court not to consider whether the debtor had made or currently makes charitable contributions.we agree with the district court that the absence of limiting language like this in the earlier part of subsection b indicates that congress did not intend to place any other limitations on the court in ruling on such motions.however,we would take the district court statutory analysis one step further and point out that the phrase or continues to make suggests that the court is entitled to focus on subsequent developments in the debtor financial condition,except to what charities the debtor is presently contributing.
although some of the statutory language in b indicates that a court can consider events occurring prior to the discharge,we must still give effect to the words substantial abuse in b.neither the statute nor any other provision in the bankruptcy code defines substantial abuse or indicates how it should be determined.while none of our sister circuits has considered whether a court should take into account events in making a substantial abuse determination,many of them have addressed how substantial abuse should be determined under b.see stewart trustee in re stewart,cir kornfield schwartz in re kornfield,cir in re lamanna,at green staples in re green,cir in re krohn,cir in re walton,cir zolg kelly in re kelly,cir.these courts agree that a debtor ability to repay his debts out of future income is a primary factor to be considered in determining whether to dismiss for substantial abuse a consideration of the debtor future earnings also follows the analysis favored by most bankruptcy commentators.see,collier on bankruptcy ed.the primary factor that may indicate a substantial abuse is the ability of the debtor to repay the debts out of future disposable income.citing,at.
in determining a debtor ability to repay his debts out of future earnings,we consider whether the debtor has sufficient disposable income to fund a chapter plan.see in re koch,at a bility to pay for b purposes is measured by evaluating debtors financial condition in a hypothetical chapter proceeding.in other words,we must look to chapter to see what the creditors would receive had the debtors filed a chapter plan.see in re walton,at holding that the debtor ability to pay,out of future income,of unsecured debt within three years supported the determination of substantial abuse.such an abuse determination is nece
