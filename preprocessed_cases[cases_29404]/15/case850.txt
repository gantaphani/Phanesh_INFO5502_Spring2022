factual and procedural history 
on the morning of august,mary baked cookies for her boyfriend and his students she phoned her boyfriend and visited his workplace but was unable to get in touch with him.upset,mary returned home,drank two shots of tequila,and overdosed on zofran and percocet.at or around,she called her adult daughter in ohio and stated s he was feeling depressed,no one care d for her,she was going to end her life,and she ca handle her boyfriend.at or around,a tearful mary called her daughter again and reiterated she was feeling anxious and ending her life.mary daughter phoned mary boyfriend who contacted.a sheriff deputy and paramedics arrived at mary home,where mary confirmed she tried to harm herself.in particular,she told paramedics,n o one cares for me so i wanted to end it.mary was transported to kern medical center kmc,where she became apneic in the emergency room.her condition eventually stabilized following oxygen supplementation,intubation,and intravenous administration of narcan.mary informed an emergency department physician she was actively trying to commit suicide.
in an august phone call with kmc staff,mary daughter related mary exhibited symptoms of depression for at least years she also had frequent mood swings and strange thoughts in her mind she thinks are for real.prior to the most recent suicide attempt,mary had tried to kill herself via drug overdose on four separate occasions.nevertheless,she thinks she has no psychiatric problems and refuses to see a doctor for it.
the sheriff deputy completed an application for detention for evaluation and treatment some capitalization omitted pursuant to section,asserting probable cause to believe mary was a danger to herself.mary was transferred to kmc psychiatric unit for evaluation and treatment on august.she told kmc staff she did not suffer from depression,anxiety,mania,or psychosis and did not try to kill herself at any point.with regard to the august incident,mary claimed she ingested alcohol and percocet for her back pain.she acknowledged she spoke to and asked for help from her daughter but does remember what happened after.a mental status examination revealed poor impulse control,insight,and judgment.kmc staff diagnosed m ajor depressive disorder severe without psychotic features and opined mary was likely to harm herself as a result of a mental health disorder.on august,mary was deemed psychiatrically stable and discharged.

the court denied mary request 
the burden of proof is by preponderance of the evidence for the people to show that the person would not be likely to use firearms in a safe and lawful enforcement matter.the court is concerned with the evidence as presented in the medical report that has been disputed by mary but has not been repu dia ted as far as the court is concerned.
the evidence meets the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.mary is not stable enough to safely maintain and use firearms.she is a danger to herself,at least based on the medical evidence presented here,and a danger to others.
discussion 
i.the order is appealable.
in their respective letter briefs,both parties cited knoll davidson cal d,in which the california supreme court held there is an appeal from a final judgment entered in a special proceeding unless the statute creating the special proceeding prohibits an appeal.the parties identically reasoned section,subdivision f,permits a person subject to the prohibition to make a request for relief from the superior court said remedy constitutes a special proceeding under code of civil procedure section and denial of the request amounts to a final judgment.furthermore,section does not explicitly preclude appeals.we,therefore,hold the superior court order denying mary relief from the firearm prohibition is appealable.
ii.section,subdivision f,employs a constitutional standard of proof.
upon probable cause that a person is a danger to himself or others,that person may be detained in a mental health facility for hours for treatment and evaluation.people keil th,keil,citing.a person who has so been detained may not own,possess,control,receive or purchase any firearm for a period of five years after the detention keil,supra,at,citing,subd.f.however,the individual may request a hearing to lift this prohibition.jason,supra,th at see,subd.f.the people of the state of california shall be the plaintiff in the proceeding,subd.f and shall bear the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the person would not be likely to use firearms in a safe and lawful manner,subd.f.if the court finds that the people have not met their burden,the restriction is removed,and the person shall be entitled to own,possess,control,receive or purchase firearms,unless another legal restriction applies.jason,supra,at,citing,subd.f.
burden of proof means the obligation of a party to establish by evidence a requisite degree of belief concerning a fact in the mind of the trier of fact or the court.the burden of proof may require a party to establish the existence of a fact by a preponderance of the evidence,by clear and convincing proof,or by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.evid.code.
the function of a standard of proof is to instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication.addington texas,addington,quoting in re winship,conc.opn.of harlan.the standard serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the relative importance attached to the ultimate decision.addington,supra,at.at one end of the spectrum is the typical civil case involving a monetary dispute between private parties.since society has a minimal concern with the outcome of such private suits,plaintiff burden of proof is a mere preponderance of the evidence.the litigants thus share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion.see lillian superior court d,a preponderance of the evidence standard simply requires the trier of fact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence.
on the other end of the spectrum is a criminal case,in which the interests of the defendant are of such magnitude that historically and without any explicit constitutional requirement they have been protected by standards of proof designed to exclude as nearly as possible the likelihood of an erroneous judgment.in the administration of criminal justice,our society imposes almost the entire risk of error upon itself.this is accomplished by requiring under the due process clause that the state prove the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt.addington,supra,at,fn.omitted see calcrim proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you with an abiding conviction that the charge is true.
the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence reduce s the risk of error to the individual by increasing the government burden of proof.jason,supra,th at,quoting addington,supra,at see lillian superior court,supra,d at clear and convincing evidence requires a finding of high probability.citation.such a test requires that the evidence be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.this standard,which is less commonly used addington,supra,at,tends to be seen in civil cases involving interests deemed to be more substantial than mere loss of money ibid.see,santosky kramer,santosky termination of parental rights addington,supra,at involuntary civil commitment woodby immigration service,deportation.
except as otherwise provided by law,the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.evid.code,see conservatorship of wendland cal th,the default standard of proof in civil cases is the preponderance of the evidence.see also conservatorship of ben cal th,lps proceedings civil in nature.law includes constitutional,statutory,and decisional law.evid.code.
an individual has a constitutional right to procedural due process when the government deprives an individual of a liberty or property interest.jason,supra,th at accord,mathews eldridge.one component of procedural due process is the standard of proof used to support the deprivation jason,supra,at,which must satisfy the constitutional minimum of fundamental fairness ibid.accord,santosky,supra,at,fn.to determine whether a proof standard meets this constitutional minimum,the courts evaluate three factors the private interest affected by the proceeding the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the interest created by the state chosen procedure and the countervailing governmental interest supporting use of the challenged procedure.jason,supra,at accord,santosky,supra,at mathews eldridge,supra,at.
as noted,under section,subdivision f,t he people shall bear the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the person would not be likely to use firearms in a safe and lawful manner.mary,citing district of columbia heller heller and mcdonald city of chicago mcdonald,argues the standard of proof should be clear and convincing evidence in view of procedural due process and the second amendment.
we find persuasive the analysis in jason,in which the fourth appellate district upheld the preponderance of the evidence standard set forth in section,subdivision f 
first,with respect to the private interest element of the due process test,an individual right to possess firearms is of fundamental constitutional stature.heller,supra,mcdonald,supra.however,this constitutional right is subject to the state traditional authority to regulate firearm use by individuals who have a mental illness.heller,supra,at.moreover,the length of the threatened loss is a relevant factor in analyzing the nature of the private interest.santosky,supra,at.under section,the deprivation of the right is lengthy,but temporary,lasting for five years.further,the infringement concerns the loss of property,and does not involve deprivation of physical liberty or severance of familial ties.the deprivation is thus not akin to the types of cases such as termination of parental rights,civil commitment,withholding of,forced sterilization,or deportation where a clear and convincing evidence standard is typically imposed.additionally,although the loss of the right to possess firearms can impact an individual ability to defend himself or herself,the deprivation does not leave the individual exposed to danger without recourse to other defensive measures,such as installing home security devices and summoning the police.
balanced against the individual temporary loss of the right to possess firearms is the state strong interest in protecting society from the potential misuse of firearms by a mentally unstable person.rupf yan th,rupf noting that it is not unreasonable to conclude there is a significant risk that a mentally unstable gun owner will harm himself or others with the weapon see heller,supra,at mcdonald,supra,at.section and its counterpart,which permits confiscation of firearms are preventative in design the fundamental purpose is to protect firearm owners and the public from the consequences of firearm possession by people whose mental state endangers themselves or others.people v.one ruger caliber pistol th.these protective statutes limit the availability of handguns to persons with a history of mental disturbance to protect those persons or others in the event their judgment or mental balance remains or again becomes impaired.rupf,supra,th at.
although the preponderance of the evidence standard requires the individual to share equally in the risk of an erroneous adjudication,this risk sharing is justified under circumstances where an individual exhibited a mental disorder sufficient to warrant hospitalization because of facts showing the individual may endanger himself or others.the statute places the burden on the government to show the individual would not be likely to use the weapons in a safe manner,subd.f.but if the government was required to satisfy this burden by clear and convincing evidence,this would increase the possibility that a person might be gravely injured or killed if the government failed to meet this rigorous proof burden.when the gravity of the potential consequences of allowing possession of guns by an individual with a history of a manifested mental disturbance is balanced against the temporary deprivation of access to these weapons,the balance weighs in favor of permitting proof by a preponderance of the evidence.jason,supra,th at.
in addition,we do not believe the risk of an erroneous deprivation,the second factor of the fundamental fairness balancing test is so elevated as to override jason holding.before the firearm prohibition can be imposed on someone,that person must have been a taken into custody as provided in s ection because that person is a danger to himself,herself,or to others,b assessed within the meaning of s ection,and c admitted to a designated facility within the meaning of s ections and because that person is a danger to himself,herself,or others,subd.f see in re azzarella,supra,d at t he risk of erroneous deprivation is minimized by the requirement of readily observable evidence of mental disorder.after the prohibition is imposed,the person upon his or her request is afforded a mandatory court hearing,subd.f.copies of the mental health treatment facility reports delineating the legal grounds for the hold shall be disclosed upon request to the person,subd.f and any information prov
