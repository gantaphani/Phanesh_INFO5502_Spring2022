does the motor vehicle information and cost savings act the odometer act or the act,and its implementing regulations,pt,allow a private right of action where the fraud relates to something other than the vehicle this case,its accident history

finding the reasoning in ioffe persuasive,we conclude that the private right of action under the odometer act is limited to allegations of fraud relating to a vehicle mileage.
factual background and procedural status 
mayble bodine bodine,an elderly grandmother in the market for a truck for her grandson,purchased a used dodge for from graco,and its owners graco.in the course of closing the transaction,graco provided bodine with an accurate odometer mileage statement but did not provide a copy of the vehicle title.despite graco assurances that the vehicle was in good condition,the title would have revealed it was anything but.in fact,the vehicle title had been branded restored salvage in accordance with arizona law bodine claims that graco deliberately withheld the title in order to conceal that the vehicle had been severely damaged in an earlier collision.had graco made the mileage disclosure on the title,bodine would have examined the title,noticed that it was branded restored salvage,and would not have purchased the truck.
bodine discovered the truck branding after she subsequently received a copy of the vehicle registration.she also discovered the truck had mechanical problems rendering it dangerous to drive.bodine asked graco to take the truck back.graco refused and denied any knowledge of its branded status,even though graco in fact knew about that status when it sold bodine the truck.
after bodine filed her complaint in district court,the parties consented to have a magistrate judge hear the matter.graco then filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under rule b of civil procedure,and the magistrate judge granted the motion.
assuming,for the moment,that the court correctly held that a successful odometer act claim must include an allegation that the defendant intended to defraud as to mileage,the court nonetheless erred by treating this as a jurisdictional requirement,and not as an ingredient of the claim for relief.
the supreme court recently explained that when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.arbaugh y h,d.the language is found in a,which is captioned violation and amount of damages.the language is found in a neighboring subsection,b,which is captioned civil actions.because a does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,it was improper to dismiss this case on jurisdictional grounds arbaugh,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
although graco incorrectly filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,its more general argument regarding the with intent to defraud provision is not necessarily flawed.we have the discretion to proceed with this appeal as if the district court granted a rule b motion,and we choose to do so here.see moore united kingdom,cir capital tracing,united states,cir.we have,therefore,drawn the facts of this case from the allegations of the complaint,which we accept as true.broam bogan,cir.

discussion 
bodine theory is that graco was obligated to provide her with a title containing an accurate description of the vehicle mileage,and that graco failed in that obligation when it deliberately withheld the title in an effort to conceal the vehicle collision history.recognizing that bodine theory is exclusively concerned with the vehicle title,and is in no way related to the representations about the truck odometer,we turn to the language of the statute.see knight comm r,d.
i.the odometer act 
the statutory scheme begins with a list of congress findings and purposes.
congress finds that 
buyers of motor vehicles rely heavily on the odometer reading as an index of the condition and value of a vehicle 
buyers are entitled to rely on the odometer reading as an accurate indication of the mileage of the vehicle 
an accurate indication of the mileage assists a buyer in deciding on the safety and reliability of the vehicle and 
motor vehicles move in,or affect,interstate and foreign commerce.
id.a.the odometer act purposes are to prohibit tampering with motor vehicle odometers and to provide safeguards to protect purchasers in the sale of motor vehicles with altered or reset odometers.id.b.
congress effectuated these purposes by outlawing actions that would cause discrepancies between a vehicle actual mileage and its odometer reading.the act prohibits odometer tampering with intent to change the mileage registered by the odometer.id.it also forbids advertising for sale,selling,using,installing,or having installed a device that makes an odometer of a motor vehicle register a mileage different from the mileage the vehicle was driven,as registered by the odometer within the designed tolerance of the manufacturer of the odometer.id.it is also unlawful to,with intent to defraud,operate a motor vehicle on a street,road,or highway if the person knows that the odometer of the vehicle is disconnected or not operating.id.
regulating odometer tampering is congress first method of achieving the act goals the second method seeks to empower consumers by providing them with accurate information at the time of a vehicle transfer by regulation of the national highway traffic safety administration i n connection with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle,each transferor shall disclose the mileage to the transferee in writing on the title c emphasis added.title is statutorily defined as the certificate of title or other document issued by the state indicating ownership.see also.according to bodine,graco did not make the mileage disclosure on the title as required by.
the odometer act provides different methods of enforcement.the secretary of transportation secretary can impose a civil penalty of up to per violation of the act or its regulations,and the attorney general is tasked with enforcing such penalties in a civil action.a.the attorney general or the chief law enforcement officer of a state can bring suit to enjoin violations of the act and its regulations.id.c,d a.the act provides a criminal penalty applicable to a person that knowingly and willfully violates this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter.id.b.
in addition to these public means of enforcement,the act creates a private cause of action.the private cause of action has an independent liability provision a person that violates this chapter or a regulation prescribed or order issued under this chapter,with intent to defraud,is liable for times the actual damages or,whichever is greater.a emphasis added a private person that prevails in a civil action is entitled to attorney fees and costs.id.b.
this last penalty is at issue here.specifically,we must decide what congress meant by with intent to defraud in a.
ii.ioffe and owens 
as noted above,the seventh and eleventh circuits have addressed the meaning of with intent to defraud in a.see owens samkle auto,cir per curiam ioffe skokie motor sales,cir.although they agree that the plain language of the statute resolves the dispute,they reach directly opposite conclusions.
ioffe,nearly identical to our facts,was the first to tackle the issue.ioffe purchased a used vehicle that had a certificate of title identifying the vehicle as rebuilt.at the time of purchase,however,the dealer did not inform ioffe that the car had been rebuilt or show him the car title.the dealer had,however,given him an accurate odometer disclosure statement listing the same mileage reading as appeared on the title.while not disputing the accuracy of the mileage statement,ioffe asserted that the dealer failed to produce the vehicle title in an effort to defraud him as to the title rebuilt designation,and he brought claim under the odometer act and c.at.
the seventh circuit rejected this theory,concluding that t he odometer act creates a private right of action for violations of c only where a transferor chose not to disclose a vehicle mileage to the transferee in writing on the title with intent to defraud as to the vehicle mileage.id.at.
two and a half months after ioffe,the eleventh circuit decided owens.owens,like ioffe and bodine,purchased a used car without seeing its title.she did sign a number of a power of attorney,an odometer disclosure statement,and an application for certificate of because the car mileage was not disclosed to her on the title,she alleged a violation of.her theory was not,however,that the defendant intended to defraud her with respect to the vehicle mileage.rather,she alleged that the used the transfer forms in lieu of a title to conceal what the title would have the car was previously a rental vehicle owned by hertz.at.
the eleventh circuit held that the complaint alleged all of the necessary elements required for a private cause of action pursuant to this statute that the defendant violated the act or its regulations,with intent to defraud.id.at.it rejected the argument that the fraud must be with respect to the vehicle mileage because n o language limits the meaning of the clause with intent to defraud.id.
iii.interpreting the odometer act 
the text and purpose of the odometer act lead us to believe that the seventh circuit has the better of the two positions.to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,a plaintiff suing under must allege that the defendant violated the odometer act with intent to defraud as to mileage.
bodine textual argument mirrors the thinking of the owens court because with intent to defraud is not immediately preceded or followed by any explicit language limiting the provision to odometer fraud,the only natural reading,bodine argues,is that no such limit exists.
when there is no statutory definition or definitive clue,a phrase meaning has to turn on the language as we normally speak it.watson united states,d.in ordinary language,with intent to defraud is not intrinsically limited,especially not to odometer fraud.when is studied in isolation,then,bodine reading is not obviously wrong.
it is,however,our duty to construe statutes,not isolated provisions.gustafson alloyd,d.t he meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context.holloway united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.
with the odometer act,we have a source of a reasonable inference about what congress understood when writing.watson.at.helpfully,congress made clear its purposes to prohibit odometer tampering and to protect consumers against the sale of vehicles with altered or reset odometers.b.every part of the statutory scheme speaks specifically of odometer fraud there is not a single statutory phrase that suggests congress wished to reach additional types of fraud.see id.targeting physical odometer tampering id.providing specific procedures for repairing and replacing odometers id.requiring disclosure only of transferred vehicle cumulative mileage.
the effect of all of these express references to odometer fraud is to limit the meaning of with intent to defraud.see gutierrez ada,d understanding the statutory phrase any election to mean an election for governor and lieutenant governor because of numerous other references to governor and lieutenant governor.even though a does not contain any mention of odometer fraud,it incorporates the provisions of the act by referring to this chapter or a regulation prescribed or order issued under this chapter.
in ioffe,the court usefully replaced this shorthand with the language of c a person that does not disclose the mileage to the transferee in writing on the title,with intent to defraud,is liable.at alteration in original.reviewing this language,the court reasoned 
the use of with in with intent to defraud indicates a link between the violative conduct and the intent requirement.the conduct and the fraudulent intent are not two independent elements such that any contemporaneous fraud will do.rather,there is a prohibited disclosing the mileage to the transferee in writing on the is modified by the adverbial phrase with intent to defraud.thus,the private right of action covers prohibited acts that are committed with fraudulent intent and excludes cases where some fraudulent act happens to coincide with a violation of a regulation but the violative act is done for reasons other than to perpetrate a fraud.
this reasoning is sound.although in other statutes with intent to defraud might be read capaciously,in a it is limited by the purposes of the odometer act.see reves ernst young,d t he statutory phrase any note should not be interpreted to mean literally any note,but must be understood against the backdrop of what congress was attempting to accomplish in enacting the securities acts.the substantive provisions of the act are confined to odometer fraud,even though we can safely assume that congress does not condone other types of fraud in vehicle transfers.in creating a private right of action,congress added a further limitation only violators who act with intent to defraud will be subject to special damages provisions.bodine offers no cogent reason why congress would fastidiously restrict the substantive reach of the act to odometer fraud while making a liability turn on intent to commit any type of fraud.
a broader reading of with intent to defraud might lead to results inconsistent with the act purposes.because a term should be construed,if possible,to give it a consistent meaning throughout the statute,gustafson,at,the with intent to defraud language of a would presumptively control the interpretation of the same language in.as mentioned earlier,that section states that a person may not with intent to defraud,operate a motor vehicle if the person knows that the odometer of the vehicle is disconnected or not operating.on bodine reading,an individual would be liable under the odometer act if he fraudulently sold merchandise while happening to drive a vehicle with a broken odometer.even though n o language limits the meaning of the clause with intent to defraud,owens,at,congress surely did not intend that be read this way.
bodine argues that a vehicle restored salvage status provides a direct nexus with its odometer reading.because rebuilders use different parts from different vehicles when restoring a salvaged vehicle,they face choices about how to disclose the rebuilt vehicle mileage.if a major part is replaced,the rebuilder must decide whether to list the mileage as it read prior to the replacement,or to link it instead to the mileage of the replacement part.these situations allow opportunistic rebuilders to tamper with an odometer reading to the detriment of a future consumer.
if this is correct,then bodine can satisfy the pleading requirements of the odometer act by alleging that graco withheld the title of the restored salvage truck with the intent to defraud her as to the truck mileage.if bodine could prove that the mileage was unlawfully altered in the rebuilding process,and that graco withheld the title in an effort to conceal this fact,then bodine would,we assume,have a valid odometer act claim.but bodine has alleged none of this in her complaint,so there is no reason for this court to consider a nexus that might be present in other cases involv
