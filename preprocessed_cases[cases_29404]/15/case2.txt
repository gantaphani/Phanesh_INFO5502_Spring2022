justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns enforcement,through private suits,of the telephone consumer protection act of tcpa or act.voluminous consumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology for example,computerized calls dispatched to private homes prompted congress to pass the tcpa.congress determined that federal legislation was needed because telemarketers,by operating interstate,were escaping prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls.the act bans certain practices invasive of privacy and directs the federal communications commission fcc or commission to prescribe implementing regulations.it authorizes states to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices and to recover damages on their residents behalf.the commission must be notified of such suits and may intervene in them.jurisdiction over tcpa suits,congress provided,lies exclusively in the district courts.congress also provided for civil actions by private parties seeking redress for violations of the tcpa or of the commission implementing regulations.
petitioner marcus mims,complaining of multiple violations of the act by respondent arrow financial services,llc arrow,a agency,commenced an action for damages against arrow in the district court for the southern district of florida.mims invoked the court federal question jurisdiction,its authority to adjudicate claims arising under the laws of the united states,the district court,affirmed by the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit,dismissed mims complaint for want of jurisdiction.both courts relied on congress specification,in the tcpa,that a private person may seek redress for violations of the act or of the commission regulations thereunder in an appropriate court of a state,if such an action is otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of that state.b,c.
the question presented is whether congress provision for private actions to enforce the tcpa renders state courts the exclusive arbiters of such actions.we have long recognized that a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.american well works layne bowler.beyond doubt,the tcpa is a federal law that both creates the claim mims has brought and supplies the substantive rules that will govern the case.we find no convincing reason to read into the tcpa permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts any barrier to the district courts exercise of the general jurisdiction they have possessed since.see act of,stat.wright,miller,cooper,freer,federal practice and procedure,ed.hereinafter wright miller.we hold,therefore,that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits arising under the tcpa.
in enacting the tcpa,congress made several findings relevant here.unrestricted telemarketing,congress determined,can be an intrusive invasion of privacy.tcpa,stat,note following congressional findings internal quotation marks omitted.in particular,congress reported,m any consumers are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive,nuisance telemarketing calls to their homes.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.a utomated or prerecorded telephone calls made to private residences,congress found,were rightly regarded by recipients as an invasion of privacy.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.although over half the states had enacted statutes restricting telemarketing,congress believed that federal law was needed because telemarketers could evade prohibitions through interstate operations.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.see also,b ecause states do not have jurisdiction over interstate calls,m any states have expressed a desire for federal legislation 
subject to exceptions not pertinent here,the tcpa principally outlaws four practices.first,the act makes it unlawful to use an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice message,without the prior express consent of the called party,to call any emergency telephone line,hospital patient,pager,cellular telephone,or other service for which the receiver is charged for the call.see b a,the tcpa forbids using artificial or prerecorded voice messages to call residential telephone lines without prior express consent.b b.third,the act proscribes sending unsolicited advertisements to fax machines.b c.fourth,it bans using automatic telephone dialing systems to engage two or more of a business telephone lines simultaneously.b d 
the tcpa delegates authority to the fcc to ban artificial and prerecorded voice calls to businesses,b a,and to exempt particular types of calls from the law requirements,b b,c.the act also directs the fcc to prescribe regulations to protect the privacy of residential telephone subscribers,possibly through the creation of a national do not call system.c 
congress provided complementary means of enforcing the act.state attorneys general may bring a civil action on behalf of state residents,if the attorney general has reason to believe that any person has engaged in a pattern or practice of violating the tcpa or fcc regulations thereunder.g supp.the district courts of the united states have exclusive jurisdiction over all tcpa actions brought by state attorneys general.g.the commission may intervene in such suits.g 
title b,captioned private right of action,provides 
a person or entity may,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,bring in an appropriate court of that state 
a an action based on a violation of this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,
b an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation,or to receive in damages for each such violation,whichever is greater,or 
c both such actions.
if the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection,the court may,in its discretion,increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than times the amount available under subparagraph b of this paragraph.
a similar provision authorizes a private right of action for a violation of the fcc implementing regulations

section,our decisions indicate,is not swept away so easily.as stated earlier,see supra,at,when federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the substantive rules of decision,the claim arises under federal law,and district courts possess jurisdiction under that principle endures unless congress divests federal courts of their adjudicatory authority.see,verizon.public serv.comm of,nothing in e divest s the district courts of their authority under to review the state agency order for compliance with federal law.k mart cartier,the district court would be divested of jurisdiction if this action fell within one of several specific grants of exclusive jurisdiction to the court of international trade under a or i.

arrow arguments do not persuade us that congress has eliminated jurisdiction over private actions under the tcpa.
the language of the tcpa a person or entity may,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,bring an action in an appropriate court of that state,b arrow asserts,is uniquely oriented.see brief for respondent.that may be,but i t is a general rule that the grant of jurisdiction to one court does not,of itself,imply that the jurisdiction is to be exclusive.united states bank of new york trust.

title b does not state that a private plaintiff may bring an action under the tcpa only in state court,or exclusively in state court.the absence of such a statement contrasts with the act instruction on suits instituted by state attorneys general.as earlier noted,see supra,at,g supp.vests exclusive jurisdiction over such actions in t he district courts of the united states.section g exclusivity prescription reinforce s the conclusion that b silence leaves the jurisdictional grant of untouched.for where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded,it was excluded expressly.verizon,at see erienet,at alito,dissenting g supp.reveals that,while drafting the tcpa,congress knew full well how to grant exclusive jurisdiction with mandatory language.the most natural interpretation of congress failure to use similar language in b is that congress did not intend to grant exclusive jurisdiction in that section.brill,at g supp.is explicit about exclusivity,while b is not the natural inference is that the state forum mentioned in b is optional rather than mandatory.
arrow urges that congress would have had no reason to provide for a private action in an appropriate state court,b,if it did not mean to make the state forum exclusive.had congress said nothing at all about bringing private tcpa claims in state courts,arrow observes,those courts would nevertheless have concurrent jurisdiction.see supra,at.true enough,but congress had simultaneously provided for tcpa enforcement actions by state authorities,g supp,and had made federal district courts exclusively competent in such cases,g.congress may simply have wanted to avoid any argument that in private actions,as in actions brought by state attorneys general,federal jurisdiction is exclusive.brill,at emphasis deleted citing yellow freight,holding,after years of litigation,that claims under the civil rights act of may be resolved in state as well as federal courts and tafflin,holding,after years of litigation,that claims under rico may be resolved in state as well as federal courts.moreover,by providing that private actions may be brought in state court if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of the state,b,congress arguably gave states leeway they would otherwise lack to decide for themselves whether to entertain claims under the tcpa,brill,at.see brief for respondent congress le ft states free to decide what tcpa claims to allow.

we are not persuaded,moreover,that congress sought only to fill a gap in the states enforcement capabilities.had congress so limited its sights,it could have passed a statute providing that telemarketing calls directed into a state would be subject to the laws of the receiving state.congress did not enact such a law.instead,it enacted detailed,uniform,federal substantive prescriptions and provided for a regulatory regime administered by a federal agency.see.tcpa liability thus depends on violation of a federal statutory requirement or an fcc regulation,b a,c,not on a violation of any state substantive law.
the federal interest in regulating telemarketing to protec t the privacy of individuals while permit ting legitimate commercial practices,stat,note following congressional findings internal quotation marks omitted,is evident from the regulatory role congress assigned to the fcc.see,b delegating to the fcc authority to exempt calls from the act reach and prohibit calls to businesses.congress design would be less well served if consumers had to rely on the laws or rules of court of a state,b,or the accident of diversity jurisdiction to gain redress for tcpa violations.

computerized calls are the scourge of modern civilization.they wake us up in the morning they interrupt our dinner at night they force the sick and elderly out of bed they hound us until we want to rip the telephone right out of the wall.
the substitute bill contains a private provision that will make it easier for consumers to recover damages from receiving these computerized calls.the provision would allow consumers to bring an action in state court against any entity that violates the bill.the bill does not,because of constitutional constraints,dictate to the states which court in each state shall be the proper venue for such an action,as this is a matter for state legislators to determine.nevertheless,it is my hope that states will make it as easy as possible for consumers to bring such actions,preferably in small claims court
