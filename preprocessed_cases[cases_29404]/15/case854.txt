code of civil procedure section governs the conditions for coordination of civil actions in february,a coordination motion judge found that a coordination proceeding was appropriate for approximately cases filed in nine california counties.six months later,the judge assigned as the coordination trial judge for those cases,applying the same statutory factors,refused to add to the coordination proceeding substantively indistinguishable cases in the same counties,most of which had been recently filed.
in this writ proceeding,we conclude a trial judge order declining to add cases to a coordination proceeding,like the coordination motion judge original order,is subject to our independent review.we further conclude the trial court erred in refusing to add the cases to the proceeding.accordingly,we grant the writ petition.
factual and procedural background 
in december,ford motor company filed a petition for coordination of more than cases in which plaintiffs in counties across the state had sued ford.the actions alleged ford breached warranties with respect to cars equipped with the transmission ford fiesta model years and ford focus model years.ford contended the cases met the criteria for coordination described in section and court rules.section states 
coordination of civil actions sharing a common question of fact or law is appropriate if one judge hearing all of the actions for all purposes in a selected site or sites will promote the ends of justice taking into account whether the common question of fact or law is predominating and significant to the litigation the convenience of parties,witnesses,and counsel the relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel the efficient utilization of judicial facilities and manpower the calendar of the courts the disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent rulings,orders,or judgments and,the likelihood of settlement of the actions without further litigation should coordination be denied.
by order dated february,the coordination motion judge emilie elias found that a coordination proceeding was proper and would benefit the goals of the coordinated cases as to approximately of the cases,in nine mostly southern of the counties.judge kenneth freeman was designated the coordination trial judge,and the second appellate district was selected as the court of appeal.
several plaintiffs sought a writ of mandate overturning the coordination order,describing the coordinated cases as simple breach of warranty cases brought under california lemon law the consumer warranty act that happen to have a common.we summarily denied the writ petition on april.
the coordination trial judge issued an order on april,staying the coordination proceeding until the initial status conference.in a letter from court counsel,we were advised the stay is still in place and has not been modified.
in may,ford filed a petition to add similar cases,most of which had been recently filed,to the coordination proceeding.these cases consisted of recently filed cases served around or after the time ford identified actions to include in its original petition for coordination filed on december,to the present cases ford inadvertently not included sic in the original petition and cases previously excluded from ford original petition due to a,trial date,which trial dates have since been continued.ten days later,ford withdrew cases from the cases as having been settled dismissed or otherwise should be withdrawn as of march,approximately of the cases subject to the petition had been settled or dismissed.
ford declared that all the cases assert a claim for breach of warranty regarding the ford fiesta and ford focus vehicles equipped with the transmission,and were pending in one of the nine counties identified in judge elias coordination order.ford asserted coordination was appropriate because the cases involve similar allegations and the same named defendant,ford,and coordination would advance the convenience of the parties,witnesses and counsel,conserve judicial resources and avoid the risk of duplicative or inconsistent rulings,orders,and judgments.
at an initial status conference on june,the court continued the motion to july,and ordered the parties to file a joint report on case categories,a discovery plan,views on a protective order,and a proposed case management plan.the court stated it needed to know how many of the cases are products liability cases versus lemon law cases.one of plaintiffs counsel responded that there were lemon law,warranty and fraud cases,but i do think there are any product cases.the chart prepared for the july,status conference confirmed there were no products liability cases already under coordination or among the cases.the status conference set for july,was continued to july.
the court issued a tentative ruling denying ford petition for coordination of the cases.at the hearing,the court summarized its reasoning this way 
all right.so here is the problem.
we have all these lemon law cases against ford,and the lemon law cases are individual consideration cases.has ford had an opportunity to correct the defect how many times has the car been taken to the dealer who is the defendant is it the dealer who failed to maintain or is it the ford motor company that in some way created a defective vehicle,a lemon so what you have is you have every case is different.
yes,there can be one common protective order,but you do need a complex court for that.
and so because every case is different,the court ca manage these cases in the way that the complex courts generally manage.
if we have a series of cases that can be managed by the court,cases with a common for example,if this were a products liability case we could suspend any discovery on anything other than the specific defects and then ford could have discovery in that one area.we could determine whether there was some sort of design defect in this transmission.
the court commonly handles multiple plaintiff tort cases where the torts are all the same.the court commonly handles class actions where,you know,you have clra claims,fraud claims,although fraud does generally work for class actions.
the point is lemon law cases are not amenable to complex management,because i ca look at specific issues that i can solve.for example,where we have one motion or we take a bellwether,one case,and that could be applied to all the rest.
instead we have cases with many,many different components that are not the same,different dealers,different repair histories,some with no repair histories.
there is no way to manage these cases.it would be like saying every single lemon law case against ford should be in one court.and you would have one court.it the ford court handling lemon law cases.
then we would still need to worry about discovery which is individualized.
there is no legal issue that we can decide that will decide all of the cases.
in short,in my view these cases should not have even been coordinated in the first place.
the court also observed that judge elias ruling was not an issue here because judge elias ruling is complete.i have these cases.the question is do i add more to them,because as i see it before the year is over i would have another thousand cases.then i would wind up doing nothing but litigating these individual cases.a t this stage i only concerned with whether i should add more of the same.and also what i have in front of me is slightly different than what judge elias had,because with judge elias there were product liability cases included.
judge freeman took the matter under submission and a month later denied the petition,finding the criteria for coordination under section were not satisfied,and that the cases were not complex under the rules of court.cal.rules of court,rule.
judge freeman found only one coordination criterion was satisfied the relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel favored coordination,as the great majority of the cases were recently filed with no trial date,and in the others no depositions or vehicle inspections had occurred.the court found all the other factors weighed against coordination.specifically,the court concluded that 
first,litigating issues regarding the defective transmissions will inherently be heavily individualized as to each individual vehicle,and would not be a predominating fact significant to this litigation.to the contrary,the court would be required to consider,among other factors,the specific design or manufacturing problem with each vehicle and any representations made by the defendant as well as the dealer leading up to the purchase of each vehicle.
second,there would be great inconvenience to counsel,parties,and witnesses in having to travel from different counties to litigate their claims in los angeles especially given that a large number of the cases originated in san diego,riverside,and san bernardino.
third,i t would not be more convenient to have all of these cases coordinated before a single trial judge,as it would not make efficient use of judicial facilities and manpower.
fourth,t here is not a significant risk that there would be duplicative and inconsistent rulings regarding ford liability if individual cases were allowed to go forward outside of the coordination process again,given the issues specific to each vehicle and to each filed case.
fifth,the court is not persuaded that settlement would be more likely in a coordinated proceeding than if the cases were individually allowed to proceed.
finally,the court stated that it could not make the finding that the cases are all complex under rule.it is not at all apparent that the cases would require numerous pretrial motions raising difficult or novel legal issues with respect to the model year transmissions.
thus,the court determined that,on balance,the criteria under section are not satisfied,and that coordination of the cases is not appropriate.
three weeks later,ford filed a petition for writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its ruling and to grant the petition,or in the alternative,to reconsider the petition consistent with the coordination rules and other legal authorities.
we directed real parties in interest to file a preliminary response to the petition and permitted ford to file a reply.we then issued an alternative writ,directing the trial court either to vacate its order and enter a new order granting ford petition,or to show cause before this court why a peremptory writ requiring the court to do so should not issue.
the trial court declined to comply with the alternative writ.a letter from court counsel stated the cases in the granted original coordination petition were coordinated based upon causes of action against ford alleging product liability and design defect issues,which was appropriate for coordination.however,the appropriate cases were mixed in with standard lemon law cases that were based upon individual dealer alleged failing to fix specific problems after a reasonable number of tries.such cases achieve no benefit from coordination because individual issues predominate each rises and falls on a particular dealer ability to correct a particular problem.counsel further stated the trial court believed it would be helpful if the parties briefed the issue of the court discretion to deny an petition in these circumstances,and requested that we publish our opinion to provide guidance to the coordinating court.
real parties in interest then filed a written return to the petition,and ford filed its traverse.
discussion 
the governing legal principles 
section governs a petition for coordination,and requires it to be supported by a declaration stating facts showing that the actions are complex,as defined by the judicial council and that the actions meet the standards specified in section.the chairperson of the judicial council then assigns,or authorizes the assignment of,a coordination motion judge to determine whether the actions are complex,and if so,whether coordination of the actions is appropriate.
the coordination standards specified in section have been recited above.the same coordination standards apply to a decision whether to grant a request to coordinate an additional action.section provides in pertinent part that t he presiding judge of any court in which there is pending an action sharing a common question of fact or law with actions coordinated pursuant to section,on the motion of any party supported by an affidavit stating facts showing that the action meets the standards specified in section may request the judge assigned to hear the coordinated actions for an order coordinating the action.coordination of the action shall be determined under the standards specified in section.
similarly,rule defines an a case as an action that is proposed for coordination,under section,with actions previously ordered coordinated.rule.rule governs the contents of petitions for coordination,including a request that a coordination trial judge make such a determination concerning an case rule a.such petitions must be supported by a memorandum and declarations showing t he facts relied on to show that each included action meets the coordination standards specified in section rule a.
rule governs cases,specifying that requests to coordinate cases must comply with the requirements of the rules governing an original petition for coordination.rule a.rule also specifies that,i n deciding the request to coordinate,the court must consider the relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel,in addition to any other relevant matter.rule c.
also pertinent to our decision in this case is mcghan medical superior court th mcghan.in mcghan,the petitioners sought and obtained reversal of a superior court order denying coordination.mcghan involved a petition for coordination of at least separate cases,pending in over california counties,with additional cases being filed almost daily.id.at.the complaints sought damages for personal injuries sustained by women who had breast implants.the defendants were various manufacturers of the implant devices,producers of implant materials,and physicians who prescribed or administered the implants.ibid.some cases involved multiple plaintiffs,and most join ed either several or numerous defendants,so that the number of parties involved must run in the thousands.ibid.
the trial court in mcghan denied the coordination petition on the ground that common question s of fact or law did not predominate,in that the cases involve different implants,different designs,different warnings,different defendants,different theories of defect,different modes of failure,and different injuries.mcghan,supra,th at.
the court of appeal reversed the trial court order,remanding the case with instructions to order all the cases coordinated and,as discussed post,expressly rejecting the trial court assessment of several of the section coordination standards.mcghan,supra,th at.
the standard of review 
the mcghan case establishes that our review of the trial court order denying coordination of the cases is de novo.
in mcghan,the court explained,at considerable length,that plenary review of the coordination motion judge order denying coordination was appropriate.mcghan,supra,th at.we will not reiterate that discussion,except to commend its analysis and note our agreement with its conclusions,namely the specific discretionary call in this case was the ultimate conclusion that the benefit to be derived by coordination was outweighed by complications and problems the judge anticipated would result from attempted coordination.this decision,we apprehend,is one not necessarily made better by a trial court judge than by an appellate tribunal.t his is a decision which requires the exercise of judgment about the values that animate legal principles,and hence the concerns of judicial administration favor the appellate court,and the question should be classified as one of law and reviewed de novo.id.at.
here,real parties in interest point out this case is in a different posture,and contend we should review the trial court decision for abuse of discretion.they point to mcghan observation that,o nce coordination is established and commenced,the then rulings of the coordinating judge will most likely not be the mixed bag of law and fact they will be administrative rulings in the process of the control of specific cases by a trial judge.we would expect that such rulings would be reviewable only upon a basis of according substantial deference to the trial court opinions.mcghan,supra,th at.
we do not disagree with that principle.but we do not consider a ruling on an petition to be within mcghan contemplation when it referred to administrative rulings in the process of the control of specific cases mcghan,supra,th at.on the contrary,as real parties in interest themselves insist,the same section coordination standards apply to cases as apply in an original coordination petition.no reason appears for us to apply a different standard of review to the denial of an petition than the standard of review that applies to the denial of an original coordination petition.
ford writ petition contends the cases asserted substantively identical claims for breach of warranty related to the transmission as were asserted in the cases judge elias determined should be coordinated,and were pending in the same counties.ford contends judge elias would have coordinated the cases if they had been included in ford original petition,and judge freeman instead conducted his own reconsideration of judge elias february,order,and failed to apply the correct legal calculus 
real parties in interest,on the other hand,contend that judge elias order is simply not at issue appellate review must focus solely on judge freeman written order,not on his comments from the bench during the hearing and his ruling denying coordination of the cases correctly applied controlling law.
we agree with ford that the trial court erred in refusing to coordinate the cases.
a.the inconsistent rulings 
we agree with real parties in interest on one point as a general matter,in deciding whether to add cases to a coordination proceeding,courts are to apply the standards specified in section.that much is clear from the face of the statutes and rules we recited in part,ante.but in addition,as ford points out,in considering cases,rule c expressly requires the court to consider one of the section factors the relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel.this suggests the primacy of that factor in determining the propriety of adding a case or cases to a coordination proceeding.
that primacy makes a good deal of sense where the proposed cases have no meaningful differences from the cases already being coordinated.where the cases are substantively alike,most other coordination standards that is,the common question of law or fact predominating efficient utilization of judicial facilities and manpower the disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent rulings are unlikely to be different from those existing when the original coordination order was made.on the other hand,counsel may have devoted extensive resources in discovery and other trial preparation in some or many of the cases,and those cases may have trial dates.adding such cases to the coordination proceeding may result in costly duplication of efforts and delay in resolution of those cases.
here,the proposed cases are substantively no different than those in the original coordination order.on the record before us,we find no basis to conclude that adding them to the coordination proceeding will result in delay or duplication of effort.the coordinated proceeding has been stayed since april,so there is no risk that new counsel representing plaintiffs in the cases will seek to depose witnesses whose depositions were already taken.the cases had been recently filed or had previously set trial dates vacated.if any of the cases has had a trial date set during the pendency of this writ proceeding,or if other developments in any case renders such case unsuitable for coordination,then the coordination trial judge may consider whether to exclude that case from the coordination proceeding.
judge elias concluded that coordination of the original cases was proper and would benefit the goals of the coordinated cases while her order was short and succinct,it indicates the judge read and reviewed all of the papers heard the concerns of ford that it is more efficient and cost effective to have all of the cases in front of one judge and also heard the points made by the plaintiffs that it would not be fair to require plaintiffs in small counties and with few cases to have to travel to los angeles or other large metropolitan areas to have their matters adjudicated.we necessarily presume that the conclusion of the coordination motion judge the judge specifically designated to determine whether coordination is appropriate rule was based on evaluation of the requisite section factors.
six months later,judge freeman concluded,applying the same section factors,that none of them supported coordination of additional,substantively indistinguishable cases,except for the factor given primacy in rule c the fact they were recently filed.
we find it difficult to avoid the conclusion that judge freeman order was a direct repudiation of the coordination motion judge judge elias order.real parties in interest assert that disagreement with the original coordination order was never a basis for judge freeman actual order we believe otherwise.judge freeman tentative decision was to deny coordination of the cases.his statement from the bench,after summarizing his view of the matter,was that in short,in my view these cases should not have even been coordinated in the first place,and at this stage i only concerned with whether i should add more of the same.his final written decision was exactly the same as his tentative decision.we can not view his statement as an isolated comment from the bench that is without significance.
the way we see it,after the coordination motion judge determined the cases in the original petition were complex and coordination was appropriate,the judge who was subsequently assigned to handle the coordinated proceedings instead rejected the determination that coordination was proper.we can not countenance the implicit reversal of a decision by the coordination motion judge,particularly since a mandamus petition challenging that decision was filed as expressly permitted by section and denied.thus,the coordination proceeding was duly established.
as is apparent,the coordination statutes and rules expressly contemplate cases.unless there is some distinction between the coordinated cases and the cases and none has been suggested here we are unable to see any basis for the coordination trial judge refusal to add cases to the coordination proceeding.yet that is precisely what has been done.
we realize,of course,that there are circumstances where the addition of a substantively similar case would be properly rejected by the coordination trial judge such as if the case is ready for trial,or some other feature distinguishes it from the cases in the coordination proceeding.but the coordination statutes and rules simply do not contemplate a decision by the coordination trial judge to constrict a coordination proceeding by refusing to include more of the same.
b.the complex case issue 
at its core,the trial court refusal to coordinate the cases appears to lie in its belief that lemon law cases are not complex cases within the meaning of rule.at the hearing,the court stated that it ca manage these cases in the way that the complex courts generally manage,and t he point is lemon law cases are not amenable to complex management,and t here is no way to manage these cases.likewise,in its written ruling the court stated it can not make the finding that the cases are all complex under rule.
first,it is not the province of the coordination trial judge to determine that cases that are substantively indistinguishable from cases already subject to coordination are not complex cases.section authorizes the coordination motion judge judge elias to determine whether the actions are complex,and if so,whether coordination of the actions is appropriate in the context of a request for coordination of cases,the statutes and rules do not contemplate a further determination of whether the actions themselves are complex.the only criteria to be applied are the coordination standards specified in section.see coordination of the action shall be determined under the standards specified in section.
second,we are compelled to point out the trial court apparent misunderstanding of the nature of the coordinated actions and those proposed to be added.as noted earlier,judge freeman and court counsel have asserted that the cases before judge elias included product liability cases as well as lemon law cases,and took the view that the former are amenable to coordination while the latter are not.the court position has two flaws.
the first flaw is factual.as described above in the factual and procedural background,the record does not support the assertion that the cases before judge elias included product liability cases.indeed,at the hearing before judge elias,plaintiff counsel,arguing against coordination,made that clear the fact is they are individual cases.the issues are going to be individual.and the claim is a consumer warranty act claim,not a product liability claim involving a transmission but individual claims 
the second flaw is more significant.we see no basis for concluding that,while product liability cases are suitable for coordination,lemon law cases are not.both product liability and lemon law cases involve defects.the defect in a product liability case may be in design or manufacture,while in lemon law cases,the defect is described in terms of a departure from warranty that substantially impairs the use,value or safety of the car.certainly the latter cases raise individual issues,but so do product liability cases.just as in the asbestos cases and the breast implant cases in mcghan,a great deal of efficiency can be accomplished by coordinating lemon law cases,as we discuss,post,despite individual issues relating to repair histories.at oral argument,real parties in interest were unable to explain why it was beneficial to coordinate the asbestos and breast implant cases,but not these lemon law cases.in short,product liability cases filed by many individual plaintiffs are recognized as complex,and there is no reason why lemon law cases should be treated differently.
we also note the coordination trial judge gave only one reason for concluding the cases were not complex under rule that i t is not at all apparent that the cases would require numerous pretrial motions raising difficult or novel legal issues with respect to the model year transmissions.the reason cited by the court is only one of five factors,among other things,that a court must consider in deciding whether an action is a complex case.rule b.it is not a necessary factor.see thayer wells fargo bank th,fn.rejecting the notion that coordinated actions must necessarily be difficult or novel the coordinated actions with which we are here concerned are complex within the meaning of this rule only because of the large number of represented parties in related actions pending in different counties.
in sum,the determination whether cases are complex was a determination for the coordination motion judge.that finding was made,and was clearly proper.the coordination trial judge is not at liberty to make a contrary finding with respect to substantively indistinguishable cases.
c.the section standards 
even if we ignore the inconsistency between the order establishing the coordination proceeding and judge freeman order,we would conclude the latter can not stand.the section coordination standards,properly applied,plainly favor coordination of the cases.
i.the common questions of fact or law 
as the trial court acknowledged,all the cases like the coordinated cases,are lemon law cases that deal with defects in the transmissions of the identified ford fiesta and ford focus vehicles.nonetheless,the court found this factor weigh ed against coordinating the cases,because litigating issues regarding the defective transmissions will inherently be heavily individualized as to each individual vehicle,and would not be a predominating fact significant to this litigation.as discussed below,even real parties in interest concede there are common discovery issues involving the design and modification of the transmission and ford repurchase policies and procedures.
ford original coordination petition emphasized the coordination of pretrial motion practice,written discovery and common depositions.perhaps more significantly,real parties own position in the june,joint initial status conference report in the coordination proceeding,while proposing a approach for discovery on issues,confirms the importance of common issue discovery.
for example,real parties in interest pointed out that each plaintiff may recover treble damages by showing ford willfully failed to comply with its statutory obligation to replace or repurchase a vehicle,and relevant factors in assessing willfulness include the existence and contents of ford repurchase policies and ford knowledge of unrepairable defects.consequently,each included action requires discovery into common issues such as the design and modification of the transmission,ford knowledge of defects with the transmission,and ford repurchase policies and procedures.italics added.
common issue discovery,real parties in interest stated,should be divided into two phases,the first geared toward immediate production of material that ford has already produced plus routine foundational matters such as database locations,custodians,search terms,and document retention policies,and the second phase targeting subject matter,data sources,time frames,and witnesses not included in ford initial production.the initial phase of discovery,according to real parties in interest,will focus on the design,testing,implementation,failure and modification of the transmission and is anticipated to comprise the more than pages of documents ford has already produced in federal class actions.
real parties in interest further proposed that a global protective order be presented to the court,followed by ford production of its document retention policies,the documents produced in the class action cases,a privilege log and all documents ford was ordered to produce in any individual action before the coordination stay.real parties in interest proposed further details concerning common issue discovery on the transmission,as well as on ford internal policies regarding vehicle repurchases and lemon law compliance as well as the policies,training materials,scripts,organization charts,and related materials governing a specified ford subsidiary.
ford views on discovery and the scope of the proposed protective order were significantly different but the controlling point is clear the cases are ripe for coordination on discovery and related pretrial matters.a continued joint initial status conference report for the july,hearing included charts prepared by plaintiffs categorizing cases by alleged defect and causes of action,as well as materials further reflecting the parties respective positions on discovery,a proposed protective order and a case management plan.
all this clearly demonstrates the benefits of early coordination of discovery and motion practice benefits that are in no way negated by the court concern over litigation that is heavily individualized as to each vehicle.see mcghan,supra,th at,rejecting coordination motion judge conclusion that common questions did not predominate because breast implant cases involved different implants,different designs,different warnings,different defendants,different theories of defect,different modes of failure,and different injuries.as in mcghan,while all determinations as to whether to coordinate a case are but best estimates id.at,it seems obvious that the preparation for trial in terms of depositions,interrogatories,admissions,collection of physical data,will be better achieved if done in a coordinated manner id.at.
ii.convenience of parties,witnesses and counsel 
the trial court finding that the convenience factor weighed against coordination of the cases is similarly flawed.the court merely found that traveling from other counties to los angeles would be a great inconvenience to coun
