in this appeal,we are asked to determine whether the credit services organizations act credit services act ilcs et west applies to a transaction between a retailer,midstate siding and window company,midstate,and homeowners kenneth and ella rogers rogers.we find that the credit services act does not apply.consequently,we reverse the judgments of the appellate court and circuit court,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
on december,midstate filed a complaint in the circuit court of knox county against the rogers.in the complaint,midstate alleged that it is in the home remodeling business,and that on july,it entered into a contract with the rogers to install windows and siding at their home at a cost of.midstate further alleged that the rogers breached the contract by refusing to allow midstate to perform the work at their home.midstate sought damages of for lost profit,costs and overhead.midstate also sought to recover its costs of suit and attorney fees.midstate attached a copy of the contract to its complaint.
in their answer to the complaint,the rogers admitted that midstate is in the home remodeling business,and that they signed the contract attached to the complaint.the rogers also admitted notifying midstate that they did not want midstate to perform the work at their home.however,the rogers maintained that the contract is not enforceable because it lacks definite and certain terms it violates the credit services act ilcs et west,and the consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act ilcs et west the rogers informed midstate of their intent to cancel the contract on july,midstate failed to obtain credit for the rogers,a condition precedent to performance of the contract no payment is due under the terms of the contract and the rogers believed they were signing an estimate,not a contract.in addition,the rogers filed a counterclaim against midstate.in the counterclaim,the rogers alleged that midstate salesman,alan klunk,indicated that midstate would obtain financing for the rogers provide advice or assistance to the rogers in obtaining an extension of credit.however,in the contract,midstate failed to describe the services midstate was to provide in obtaining the extension of credit for the rogers,in violation of the credit services act and the consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act.the rogers sought an award of court costs,attorney fees and punitive damages.
midstate admitted that the rogers filled out a credit application,and that midstate forwarded the application to several lending institutions to obtain financing for the rogers.bank one,illinois,one of the institutions midstate contacted,agreed to provide a home equity loan to the rogers.in a letter dated july,bank one advised the rogers of its commitment to lend the rogers the sum of at prime plus.midstate maintained that it provided a gratuitous service to the rogers in forwarding their credit application to the financial institutions.
the matter proceeded to a bench trial at which testimony was heard but not recorded.following the trial,the circuit court issued a letter opinion as follows 
i have considered the evidence and your arguments.i find that the credit services organization act is applicable to the case at bar.i have considered the cases and find that the act is to be liberally construed to protect consumers.plaintiff qualifies as a credit services organization,that plaintiff represented to defendant that it would assist or obtain for her an extension of credit.
the contract between plaintiff and defendant is thereby unenforceable in that it does not comply with ilcs.
plaintiff argued that inadequate consideration existed to support a credit contract.this was simply not true.in order to remain competitive,the plaintiff offered a service to prospective buyers to assist them in obtaining financing to purchase siding and windows.in fact,the agreement between the plaintiff and defendant would never have been consummated had the plaintiff not helped them obtain financing.the plaintiff assistance was more than a mere service,but was part of the consideration to support the agreement.
the circuit court awarded the rogers attorney fees and costs in the amount of.however,the court found that the rogers were not entitled to an award of punitive damages.subsequently,the circuit court denied midstate motion to reconsider and clarified that midstate had violated section a of the credit services act ilcs a west.
the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court,with one justice dissenting.d.the appellate court reasoned that the credit services act applies to retailers who,in exchange for valuable consideration,aid consumers in obtaining extensions of credit.d at.the appellate court held that,by providing assistance to the rogers with regard to obtaining an extension of credit as part of an agreement to side their home,midstate acted within the purview of the credit services act.in addition the court held that the rogers were entitled to appellate attorney fees under the credit services act.
we granted midstate petition for leave to appeal.
record on review 
as noted above,a transcript of the evidence at trial is not available because the trial was not recorded.in the absence of a transcript,it is incumbent upon the appellant to file a bystander report of the proceedings c or an agreed statement of facts d.midstate failed to do so,leading the rogers to argue that we must affirm the judgments of the lower courts because the record on review is incomplete.we disagree.
midstate,as appellant,has the burden of presenting a sufficiently complete record of the proceedings at trial to support a claim of error foutch,landeros equity property development,d,and,in the absence of such a record on appeal,the reviewing court will presume that the order entered by the trial court was in conformity with the law and had a sufficient factual basis webster hartman,foutch,at.the court will resolve any doubts arising from the incompleteness of the record against the appellant.foutch,at,in re,d.however,in the present case,we are not asked to determine whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the trial court finding.see buckholtz macneal hospital,d,plaintiff maintained that the record fails to establish that an expert witness deposition fee was reasonable.instead,we are asked to interpret a statute,the credit services act,and determine whether the statute regulates the transaction at issue.this is a question of law,and the lack of a complete record does not bar our review.candice ricketts,d,in re estate of day,d,in re,d.further,because the issue before us is a matter of statutory construction,our review is de novo.sylvester industrial comm n,aldridge.
credit services act 
in determining whether the credit services act applies to the transaction at issue,we are guided by established principles.the primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.bridgestone,at,quoting illinois power mahin,in re.to do so,we examine the language of the statute,the most reliable indicator of the legislature objectives in enacting the law.michigan avenue national bank county of cook.we afford the language of the statute its plain and ordinary meaning michigan avenue national bank,at,and construe the statute as a whole sylvester,at.words and phrases must not be viewed in isolation but must be considered in light of other relevant provisions of the statute.sylvester,at,michigan avenue national bank,at.we also presume that in enacting the statute the legislature did not intend absurdity,inconvenience,or injustice.michigan avenue national bank,at.
where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous,the only legitimate function of the courts is to enforce the law as enacted by the legislature.henrich libertyville high school.it is never proper for the courts to depart from the plain language of the statute by reading into it exceptions,limitations or conditions which conflict with the intent of the legislature.bridgestone,at,quoting harvey firemen ass city of harvey.there is no rule of statutory construction which authorizes the courts to declare that the legislature did not mean what the plain language of the statute says.henrich,at,bridgestone,at.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the arguments advanced by the parties.citing section of the credit services act ilcs west,the rogers maintain that midstate is a credit services organization because midstate agreed to help the rogers obtain financing for the improvements to their home.midstate counters that it provided a gratuitous service to the rogers in forwarding their loan application to the financial institutions.midstate maintains that,in enacting the credit services act,the legislature did not intend to regulate the actions of retailers,such as midstate,in facilitating the extension of credit to their customers.we agree with midstate that the legislature did not intend to regulate the transaction at issue.
section of the credit services act provides in part 
a buyer means an individual who is solicited to purchase or who purchases the services of a credit services organization.
d credit services organization means a person who,with respect to the extension of credit by others and in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration,provides,or represents that the person can or will provide,any of the following services 
i improving a buyer credit record,history,or rating 
ii obtaining an extension of credit for a buyer or 
iii providing advice or assistance to a buyer with regard to either subsection i or ii.ilcs a,d west.
looking to the definition of a b uyer and the definition of a c redit s ervices o rganization,it is clear that the credit services act regulates transactions involving the payment of money or other valuable consideration in return for the services of the credit services organization.in turn,the services of the credit services organization are improving a buyer credit record,history,or rating obtaining an extension of credit for a buyer or providing advice or assistance to a buyer with regard to improving a buyer credit record,history,or rating or with regard to obtaining an extension of credit for the buyer.ilcs west.thus,the credit services act requires payment for credit services,not simply payment for other goods or services.
in the present case,the circuit court rejected midstate contention that there was inadequate consideration to support a contract for credit services.the circuit court observed 
in order to remain competitive,the plaintiff offered a service to prospective buyers to assist them in obtaining financing to purchase siding and windows.in fact,the agreement between the plaintiff and defendant would never have been consummated had the plaintiff not helped them obtain financing.the plaintiff assistance was more than a mere service,but was part of the consideration to support the agreement.
in this,the circuit court committed error.the credit services act requires that the credit services organization,in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration,agree to provide,or represent that it will provide,credit services to the buyer.the services must be related to an extension of credit for the buyer or improvement of the buyer credit record,history or rating.the contract at issue does not provide for payment of money or other valuable consideration in return for credit services provided by midstate.instead,the agreed consideration is for payment of windows and siding to be installed at the rogers home.although we agree with the circuit court that the rogers would not have proceeded with the installation of the windows and siding without assistance in obtaining an extension of credit,the credit services act requires additional consideration for such assistance.
our reading of the statutory language is consistent with section of the act.that section provides 
no credit services organization shall 
charge or receive any money or other valuable consideration solely for the referral of a buyer to a retail seller who will or may extend credit to the buyer if such extension of credit is in substantially the same terms as those available to the general public.emphases added.ilcs west.
the section prohibits a credit services organization from charging a fee for referrals to a retail seller.the section also recognizes that a retail seller is an entity that may extend credit to a buyer.the major distinction between a credit services organization and a retail seller is that the credit services organization,in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration,offers services to a buyer dedicated to improving the buyer credit history or rating or to obtaining an extension of credit for the buyer.
our interpretation of the statutory language is also consistent with the legislative findings and declarations set forth in the act.section of the credit services act ilcs west provides in part 
a the ability to obtain and use credit has become of great importance to consumers who have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining their credit worthiness and credit standing.as a result,consumers who have experienced credit problems may seek assistance from credit service businesses which offer to improve the credit standing of such consumers.certain advertising and business practices of some companies engaged in the business of credit services have worked a financial hardship upon the people of this state,often on those who are of limited economic means and inexperienced in credit matters.
b the purpose of this act is to provide prospective consumers of credit services companies with the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of those services and to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices.
the credit services act is aimed at remedying problems encountered by consumers seeking to improve their credit history or rating,obtain more favorable terms on current debt,or obtain an extension of credit through services provided by credit services organizations.as such,the credit services act prohibits credit services organizations from engaging in certain conduct ilcs west and requires that credit services organization make certain disclosures to the buyers ilcs,west.the credit services act is not intended to regulate retailers primarily engaged in the business of selling goods and services to their customers.the goods and services provided by retailers are not generally services aimed at improving the consumer credit or obtaining an extension of credit for the consumer,otherwise unattainable because of the consumer poor credit history or rating.see fogle william,wl.august,mem.op.
conclusion 
for the aforementioned reasons,the judgments of the appellate court and circuit court are reversed,and the cause is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
appellate court judgment reversed circuit court judgment reversed cause remanded.
the majority ignores the plain language of the act and the undisputed facts of this case.the majority does not stop there.it also reads a requirement of additional consideration into the act.at.at,at.based on these fundamental errors,the majority concludes that midstate is not a credit services organization.because i can not agree with that erroneous conclusion,i respectfully dissent.
initially,the majority cites the statutory definition of a credit services organization,encompassing a person who in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration either obtains an extension of credit for a buyer or provid es advice or assistance to a buyer with regard to obtaining an extension of credit.emphasis added.ilcs d ii,d iii west at.at,at.the majority also notes that the statutory definition of a b uyer is one who is solicited to purchase or who purchases the services of a credit services organization.ilcs a west.
after briefly acknowledging these definitions,however,the majority does not consider their application in this case,choosing instead to conclude summarily that midstate is not a credit services organization because the credit services act requires payment for credit services
