plaintiffs,unions and insurers who act as payors tpps who underwrite the purchase of prescription drugs by their members or insureds,brought this putative class action against eli lilly and company lilly,manufacturer of the drug zyprexa,alleging that lilly had misrepresented zyprexa efficacy and side effects to physicians.the putative class is composed of tpps,such as insurance providers,that paid for zyprexa prescriptions.plaintiffs argued that class members were injured in two ways first,by paying for zyprexa prescriptions that would not have been issued but for the alleged misrepresentations and second,by paying a higher price for zyprexa than would have been charged absent the alleged misrepresentations.the district court certified a class of tpps under the second theory.this appeal followed.
background 
factsa.development and approval of zyprexa 
zyprexa,the brand name for the drug olanzapine,is a prescription medicine produced by lilly.the fda approved zyprexa for treatment of schizophrenia in,and later approved it for treatment of certain symptoms of bipolar disorder.
the first wave of medications commonly prescribed to treat schizophrenia are known as antipsychotics fgas.the fgas are a group of about ten drugs first used in the.fgas often cause significant side effects,such as a movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia,and have limited efficacy.zyprexa is one of a small group of medications known as antipsychotics sgas.the first sga,approved by the fda in,was clozaril,followed by risperdal in,and zyprexa in.after zyprexa approval,the fda approved three additional sgas seroquel in,geodon in,and abilify in.
side effects and efficacy 
plaintiffs allege that as zyprexa was developed,lilly became aware of harmful side effects associated with the drug that it did not disclose to patients once zyprexa went on the market.plaintiffs presented evidence to the district court that they argue supports this conclusion.for example,studies performed by lilly in the early indicated that zyprexa was strongly associated with weight gain,with participants in a study gaining on average pounds per week.in a report prepared for submission to the fda,lilly noted that almost thirty percent of the patients in approximately fifty studies of zyprexa reported significant weight gain.
plaintiffs also allege that lilly fraudulently claimed that zyprexa was more effective than other sgas on the market.in order to gain fda approval,drug manufacturers need only show that a drug is more effective than a placebo in treating the indication for which approval is sought it is not necessary to show superiority to other available drugs.lilly submitted two studies to the fda that showed that zyprexa was better than a placebo in treating schizophrenia.plaintiffs claim to have presented evidence demonstrating that lilly falsely marketed the drug to physicians as not merely effective,but as superior to other available medications for treating schizophrenia.
prior to its approval of zyprexa,the fda recommended that lilly include information about possible weight gain in the precautions section of zyprexa label.lilly successfully argued that weight gain should be listed instead in the adverse reactions sections,thus effectively deemphasizing the significance of weight gain as a possible side effect.shortly after zyprexa launch,the fda sent lilly a warning letter stating that a teleconference led by lilly research laboratories vice president gary tollefson,in which tollefson implied that zyprexa was more effective than other sgas and had fewer side effects,was false and misleading.the warning letter singled out as misleading a statement in which tollefson argued that because the instances of weight gain occurred in many patients with relatively low starting weights,the weight gain was a therapeutic recovery rather than an adverse event.
four years later,lilly sought and received fda approval for zyprexa as a treatment for bipolar disorder,and for expanding the contexts in which it could be prescribed to treat schizophrenia.the fda approved zyprexa for the treatment of bipolar disorder in early,and for the ongoing maintenance of schizophrenia in october of the same year.as a condition of being approved for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia,the fda required lilly to articulate the narrow indications for which zyprexa was approved on the drug label and to list diabetic coma under adverse reactions.
in early,european regulatory agencies asked lilly to provide information about zyprexa side effects.in may of that year,the fda asked lilly to review its studies and summarize information linking zyprexa to hyperglycemia and diabetes.confidential internal lilly documents indicate that lilly was aware that patients taking zyprexa had an increased risk of hyperglycemia,although lilly did not understand the mechanism of the association.lilly was also aware that patients taking zyprexa were more likely to gain weight,a problem given the connection between obesity and diabetes.in november,the malaysian regulatory authority requested that lilly notify malaysian physicians outlining the increased risk of hyperglycemia associated with zyprexa.
in,japan ministry of health and welfare required lilly to send an emergency safety information letter to physicians in japan alerting them to the risk of hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis among zyprexa users.the japanese agency also required that zyprexa label include instructions to physicians to monitor blood glucose levels.after the warning was included on the label,the number of new patients prescribed zyprexa dropped by percent.the same year,mexico asked lilly to change zyprexa package inserts regarding hyperglycemia,and australia required zyprexa label be changed to reflect the increased risk of diabetes.
in,the fda agreed that lilly should add pancreatitis as an adverse reaction on zyprexa label.that same year,zyprexa was approved for the treatment of bipolar mania in canada with a statement specifically warning of increased risk of hyperglycemia,diabetes,and weight gain.european regulators also required that the european label be modified to highlight the risk of diabetes.
in september,the fda required lilly and all other sga manufacturers to add a warning concerning hyperglycemia and diabetes to sga labels.in may,the fda required the manufacturers of the sgas zyprexa,risperdal,seroquel,and abilify to add a black box warning to their labels concerning the increased risk of death in elderly patients taking those drugs for dementia.
the market for prescription drugs 
the market for prescription drugs is quite inelastic,meaning that the price of a medication rarely has significant impact on the demand for that medication.this is particularly true of medications used to treat psychiatric disorders.
the initial price set by a pharmaceutical company is sticky in that the price does not respond to market demand.rather,the price is generally increased over time as a routine matter by the manufacturer.the limited monopolies granted by patents on drugs and brand loyalty of patients and physicians result in a core group of consumers who will buy a successful drug consistently.even if negative information is released about a medication,the demand for the drug may go down,but the price generally remains the same.a drug company may even increase the price of a drug when it is expected that negative information will lower the demand,so that the price increase will compensate for the decrease in quantities sold and the overall profits of the company will not fall.
lilly produced an expert witness before the district court to describe how manufacturers set the price of a new prescription drug.eugene kolassa established a set of pricing guidelines that have been widely adopted by drug manufacturers.according to kolassa,drug manufacturers consider factors including the following 
the existence and price of competitive products and the pricing behavior of the firms that sell them,how competitor s respond to pricing actions.
the clinical,economic and social value offered by the medicine,both substantively and in economic terms.
plaintiff population characteristics,such as age,common comorbidities,and prescription drug coverage.
the factors that physicians will likely consider in determining whether to prescribe the medicine,and the degree to which the price may affect that decision.
disease characteristics,chronic or acute debilitating or cosmetic.
the reimbursement a product is likely to be reimbursed by issues in the specific market for the product.
public relations and public policy concerns over pricing.
the needs and ability of the manufacturer,including overall corporate strategy,market positioning for future performance,and the availability of internal resources to support its pricing strategy.
once the price of a new drug entering the market is established,individual transactions are also significantly different than transactions for typical consumer goods.the market for prescription drugs is unusual in that direct exchanges between consumers and producers are rare.an individual patient does not choose what drug to take she is prescribed a drug by her physician.nor does the individual patient always pay directly for that drug.rather,a tpp,such as her insurance provider,often pays some or all of the drug cost.
tpps typically pay for a prescribed medication only if the drug is authorized under their formulary,a list of medications approved for payment.the formulary is usually managed by a pharmacy benefit manager pbm.pbms manage approximately percent of all outpatient drug claims.drugs placed on a formulary are approved by the pbm pharmacy and therapeutics committee,made up of physicians and clinical pharmacists.pbms maintain their formulary based upon publicly available clinical information,which is in large part produced and disseminated by the drug manufacturers themselves.tpps have the right to customize their formulary beyond what the pbms advise,but in practice tpps rarely modify the recommendations of their pbms.on the rare occasions when a tpp customizes its formulary,it generally does so in consultation with the pbm pharmacy and therapeutics committee.
as the district court observed,in the market for prescription drugs three sets of price negotiations exist retail pharmacies and nonretail providers negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers,payors often through pbms negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers,and payors negotiate with retail pharmacies and nonretail providers.the negotiations over price,moreover,do not intersect with the therapeutic choice of what drug a patient should take,which is a decision made by a physician with only minimal input by her patient or the tpp.physicians generally do not take the price of a drug into account when deciding among treatment options,and often do not even know the price of the drugs they prescribe.this is particularly true in the treatment of mental disorders,which is an extremely individualized process.patients respond to antipsychotic drugs in an individualized manner,and patients with the same disease may respond to the same medication in very different ways.even similar,for have varying levels of success with the same patient.as a result,pbms are reluctant to exclude antipsychotic drugs from their formularies,or to place financial conditions on their use.for example,state medicaid plans often exempt antipsychotic drugs from requirements such as preferred drug lists and prior authorization provisions.
the pricing of zyprexa 
at the time of zyprexa launch,the only other sgas approved by the fda were clozaril and risperdal.clozaril,a very powerful antipsychotic,had serious,even potentially fatal,side effects.risperdal caused a greater incidence than zyprexa of socalled extrapyramidal side effects,causing symptoms such as muscle tremors,slurred speech,and other movement disorders.when lilly considered what initial price to set for zyprexa,it weighed zyprexa efficacy and side effects against those of clozaril and risperdal and set zyprexa at a higher price.one doctor who discussed the launch price with lilly before zyprexa was put on the market recalled a lilly senior employee explaining the higher price as premium drug,premium price,meaning that zyprexa high price was justified by its assertedly superior performance as compared to the other antipsychotic drugs then on the market.lilly set zyprexa initial prescription price higher than the cost of either clozaril or risperdal.
after zyprexa launch,its price was increased regularly,which was consistent with internal lilly policies.zyprexa price increased from approximately per prescription in to in and in.other sgas did not increase their price at a similar the calculations of one expert witness presented to the district court,the difference between the cost of zyprexa and that of its three main competitors increased from per prescription in to in and in.
marketing and prescriptions 
in late,lilly began marketing zyprexa to physicians.this shift was important because previously zyprexa had been targeted was almost exclusively prescribed,who treat patients with severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,the two indications for which zyprexa was approved.physicians,by contrast,treat patients for more common,and often less severe,disorders such as anxiety,depression,and dementia.
although the fda approves drugs for treatment of specific diseases,physicians may legally prescribe drugs,in their clinical judgment and discretion,for treatment of other diseases or disorders.this practice is known as use.see buckman plaintiffs legal.while prescriptions are permitted within a physician discretion,drug manufacturers are prohibited from promoting uses in marketing a drug.plaintiffs argue that lilly shifted its marketing efforts to physicians with the intention of marketing prescriptions of zyprexa for such conditions as anxiety,depression,and dementia.
lilly marketing campaign targeting physicians was known as viva zyprexa.lilly internally announced viva zyprexa in march.the campaign focused on prescribing zyprexa to treat isolated symptoms not tied to a clinical diagnosis,rather than treatment of the specific disorder and which zyprexa had been approved by the fda.for example,lilly created profiles of hypothetical patients as examples of patients who could be treated with zyprexa.one such hypothetical patient was donna,a single mom in her appearing in your office in drab clothing and seeming somewhat ill at ease.her chief complaint is that she feels anxious and irritable.lilly suggested that sales representatives say that when we look at efficacy in a patient like donna,zyprexa has been shown to improve mood,anxiety levels,and disrupted sleep patterns w hat zyprexa will mean to a patient like donna is that she will have less anxiety,less irritability and be able to sleep better.notably,the materials do not state that donna was diagnosed with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia,the two conditions that the fda approved zyprexa to treat.
another hypothetical patient,martha,posited residents of nursing homes as ideal candidates for zyprexa prescriptions.lilly assigned representatives to a longterm care sales force aimed at driv ing the nursing home business.internal documents stated that lilly number one strategy was to establish zyprexa as a first line choice in the treatment of the elderly patient who are sic experiencing behavior or cognitive symptoms.lilly pursued this market,suggesting zyprexa as beneficial for patients suffering from dementia,even though no evidence existed that zyprexa was an effective treatment for dementia and zyprexa had detrimental effects on the cognitive functioning of patients with alzheimer.
lilly also distributed a mood disorder questionnaire mdq to physicians.the questionnaire asked a series of yes or no questions resulting in a positive or negative screen.although screening tests are not diagnostic instruments and do not suggest treatment,and the mdq was not sensitive enough to diagnose bipolar disorder much less the limited types of bipolar disorder for which zyprexa was approved,the mdq became a significant source of zyprexa prescriptions.
by,almost of zyprexa prescriptions for bipolar disorder were for uses.it is unlikely that tpps paying for prescriptions were aware of the increased rate of prescriptions at the time,as pbms generally do not track offlabel prescriptions of a drug.such tracking is only possible if the drug is subject to a prior authorization program such programs are in place for fewer than two percent of prescriptions and are not common with respect to antipsychotic medication.
after the label change in september,consumption of zyprexa decreased.the peak of zyprexa prescriptions occurred in,when million prescriptions were issued.in,the number of zyprexa prescriptions fell to million,and prescriptions in were projected to fall still further to million.a new york times article stated that prescriptions of zyprexa decreased fifty percent between and.plaintiffs offered evidence to show that the decline in zyprexa prescriptions corresponds almost entirely to a drop in prescriptions,leaving only the prescriptions for the approved indications.
ii.procedural posture 
on june,national life insurance company of tennessee filed a putative class action against lilly.similar suits were brought by other tpps and individuals in the following months.the plaintiffs ultimately brought five claims in a consolidated amended complaint a civil rico claim predicated on mail fraud,conspiracy to violate rico,violation of state consumer protection laws,fraud,and unjust enrichment.these claims were based on the plaintiffs contention that lilly made false statements and omitted material information concerning the safety and efficacy of zyprexa.the plaintiffs asserted that lilly withheld information concerning the risk of weight gain,hyperglycemia,and diabetes among people taking zyprexa,and produced and disseminated false information minimizing or even denying those risks.the plaintiffs also argued that lilly falsely claimed that zyprexa was more effective than other available antipsychotics,and promoted prescriptions for zyprexa to treat conditions such as depression,anxiety,and dementia,for which there was no evidence that zyprexa provided any effective treatment.these misrepresentations,the plaintiffs argued,resulted in a higher price and greater demand for zyprexa than would have existed had accurate information about zyprexa efficacy and risks been known.
the plaintiffs offered two theories of damages.first,the quantity effect theory posited that improper promotion of use for zyprexa resulted in more prescriptions for zyprexa than would otherwise have been written.the tpps thus were harmed by paying for zyprexa that would not have been prescribed but for lilly marketing efforts promoting zyprexa as a treatment for conditions other than those for which zyprexa had been approved by the fda.second,under the or excess price theory,the claimed harm was the monetary difference between what the plaintiff class was allegedly led to believe zyprexa was worth and the actual economic value of zyprexa,taking into account the lesser efficacy and greater harmful side effects allegedly hidden or misrepresented by lilly.meredith rosenthal,plaintiffs expert witness,estimated the damages under this excess price theory for the putative class period september,to december,as between billion and billion.jeffrey harris,another expert witness for the plaintiffs,estimated damages from both theories as approximately billion.
plaintiffs sought to certify a class to recover the value of their overpayments.they proposed one purchase claim plaintiff two subclasses the payor subclass and the consumer or direct payor subclass.the two subclasses could then be further subdivided based on or purchases.plaintiffs defined the proposed class as 
all individuals and entities in the united states and its territories who,for purposes other than resale,purchased,reimbursed,paid for zyprexa during the period from september through the present.for purposes of the class definition,individuals and entities purchased zyprexa if they paid for some or all of the purchase price.
the payor subclass was defined as 
all private,entities in the united states and its territories that are at risk,pursuant to a contract,policy,or plan,to pay or reimburse all or part of the cost of zyprexa prescribed,provided,or administered to natural persons covered by such contract,policy,or plan during the period from january,to the present.
lilly moved for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs could not satisfy the elements of any of their claims.specifically,lilly argued that plaintiffs reliance on aggregate proof of reliance,rather than individualized proof,was impermissible,and that the plaintiffs could not show a sufficient causal link between lilly actions and the alleged overpricing harm.
the district court,addressing only plaintiffs excess price theory,denied lilly motion for summary judgment on june.the court concluded that the broadbased nature of lilly alleged scheme,and lilly ability to distort the general body of knowledge about zyprexa,made aggregate proof of reliance permissible.the court also found triable issues of fact relating to causation because lilly allegedly false representations and material omissions could have increased the price of and demand for zyprexa by leading doctors to continue to prescribe,and plaintiffs to continue to pay for,greater amounts than they would have absent the fraud,ultimately resulting in additional costs to plaintiffs.
the district court held a hearing in early on plaintiffs motion to certify a class.on september,the court certified a class of tpps on the rico claims predicated on the overpricing theory of damages,but refused to certify a class of individual payors or to certify a class as to the state consumer protection claims.the district court limited the class period from june,to june.
the court concluded that the proposed tpp class presented common questions of law and fact because t he only difference among class payors is how much of the total overcharge each shall receive in damages.the court first addressed whether the losses suffered by the class could be established with sufficient precision.the court concluded that 
assuming fraud leading to a price differential has been established,damages may be estimated based on the difference between what was paid for zyprexa and the actual value of the product.the computation requires i estimating the total expenditures for the class members and ii using techniques in applied economics to determine the actual value or appropriate launch price plus minor increases of zyprexa.
the district court also found that reliance could be proven for the class because the alleged fraud was directed through mailings and otherwise at doctors who relied,causing damages in overpayments by plaintiffs.this,the district court concluded,could appropriately be shown by generalized proof,in contrast to the more abstract fraud on the market theory rejected in mclaughlin am.tobacco,cir.
after approving the plaintiff class,the district court certified its order denying summary judgment under b,and lilly moved for leave to appeal.lilly also moved under federal rule of civil procedure f for leave to appeal the district court order certifying the class.this court granted lilly petition,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review denial of summary judgment de novo.see tasini times,cir.we review the district court decision to certify a class for abuse of discretion.see parker time warner entm t,cir.to the extent that the district court decision as to class certification is premised on a finding of fact,we review that finding for clear error.see in re initial pub.offerings sec,cir.
ii.class certification 
under rule b,a class action may be maintained if rule a is satisfied and if the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other methods of adjudication for fairness and efficiency.the parties agree that the requirements of rule a are satisfied but dispute whether common questions predominate.issues predominate if resolution of some of the legal or factual questions that qualify each class member case as a genuine controversy can be achieved through generalized proof,and if these particular issues are more substantial than the issues subject only to individualized proof.moore painewebber,cir.to determine whether the proposed tpp class was properly certified,therefore,we must consider whether substantial elements of its claim against lilly may be established by generalized,rather than individualized,proof.
we first briefly outline the substance of plaintiffs claims against lilly.the putative class of tpps alleges that in the course of promoting prescriptions of zyprexa,lilly engaged in mail and wire fraud by deliberately misrepresenting the drug safety and efficacy.plaintiffs claim that lilly thereby conducted a racketeering enterprise,which they called the promotion enterprise,in violation of rico.there is no real dispute that whether or not the substance of that claim is true,it is a unitary claim that is common to the putative class.
in order to recover damages under rico,however,a plaintiff must show a substantive rico violation under injury to the plaintiff business or property,and that such injury was by reason of the substantive rico violation.city of new york.com,cir,overruled on other grounds by hemi group,llc city of new york.internal quotation marks omitted holding that city asserted to collect taxes due to failure by cigarette sellers to file records with state officials as required by federal not give rise to rico claim because injury was not caused by reason of allegedly fraudulent conduct.plaintiffs argue that lilly injured them because they paid for zyprexa prescriptions that would not have been written absent the fraud the quantity effect theory and they paid too much for zyprexa prescriptions because lilly relied upon the fraud to set an excessively high price the excess price theory.while there is no dispute that the existence of a rico violation is a question common to all class members,lilly disputes that the second and third elements required to recover of an injury and proof that such injury was by reason of the rico common to the proposed class.
in order to pursue their claims as a class rather than as individual plaintiffs,the putative class must be able to prove its theory of injury through generalized proof.here,the district court found that the plaintiff class could appropriately use generalized proof to show that zyprexa was overpriced as a result of lilly excessive claims of utility as well as disavowal of adverse secondary effects of zyprexa.
to show injury by reason of a rico violation,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the violation caused his injury in two senses.first,he must show that the rico violation was the proximate cause of his injury,meaning there was a direct relationship between the plaintiff injury and the defendant injurious conduct.first nationwide bank gelt funding,cir.second,he must show that the rico violation was the or transactional cause of his injury,meaning that but for the rico violation,he would not have been injured.see holmes sec.investor prot.
until recently,this court required a rico plaintiff asserting predicate acts of fraud to show reliance that he relied on the defendant misrepresentation in order to demonstrate causation.mclaughlin,at.in bridge phoenix bond indemnity,however,the supreme court held that a plaintiff alleging a rico mail fraud is not required to show reliance.the court rejected reliance as an element of the rico fraud claim,either to show causation or to establish a direct relationship between the defendant conduct and the plaintiff injury sufficient to demonstrate proximate causation.id.at.the court explained further 
of course,none of this is to say that a rico plaintiff who alleges injury by reason of a pattern of mail fraud can prevail without showing that someone relied on the defendant misrepresentations.in most cases,the plaintiff will not be able to establish even causation if no one relied on the misrepresentation 
accordingly,it may well be that a rico plaintiff alleging injury by reason of a pattern of mail fraud must establish at least reliance in order to prove causation.but the fact that proof of reliance is often used to prove an element of the plaintiff cause of action,such as the element of causation,does not transform reliance itself into an element of the cause of action.proof that the plaintiff relied on the defendant misrepresentations may in some cases be sufficient to establish proximate cause,but there is no sound reason to conclude that such proof is always necessary.
quoting anza ideal steel supply,thomas,concurring in part and dissenting in part internal citation omitted.
plaintiffs argue that there is therefore no reliance requirement under rico.we recently addressed whether rico requires a showing of reliance by any party 
t he supreme court noted that it may well be that a rico plaintiff alleging injury by reason of a pattern of mail fraud must establish at least reliance in order to prove causation,and that there may be situations where the complete absence of reliance may prevent the plaintiff from establishing proximate cause.here,there is no question that the city has alleged reliance thus,as we find that the city has adequately alleged proximate cause and reliance,we need not address the question of whether an allegation of proximate cause fails where there are absolutely no allegations of reliance.
smokesspirits.com,at,quoting phoenix bond indem.at internal citation omitted.we find ourselves in a similar position here while reliance may not be an element of the cause of action,there is no question that in this case the plaintiffs allege,and must prove,reliance as part of their chain of causation.plaintiffs allege an injury that is caused by physicians relying on lilly misrepresentations and prescribing zyprexa accordingly.because reliance is a necessary part of the causation theory advanced by the plaintiffs,we must ask whether reliance can be shown by generalized proof.
excess price theory 
the district court granted class certification on the theory that plaintiffs could use generalized proof to show that zyprexa was overpriced as a result of lilly excessive claims of utility and disavowal of the drug adverse secondary effects.because we conclude that plaintiffs excess price theory is not susceptible to generalized proof with respect to either or proximate causation,class certification based on this theory was an abuse of discretion.
two years ago,we held that reliance on a misrepresentation made as part of a nationwide marketing strategy can not be the subject of general proof.mclaughlin,at.in mclaughlin,the alleged misrepresentation arose from the marketing of light cigarettes as healthier than cigarettes.we concluded that because each individual consumer might have purchased light cigarettes for any number of reasons other than the purported health claim,individualized proof was necessary to show the causal link between the misrepresentation that light cigarettes were healthier and the injury to the consumers who smoked light cigarettes and suffered the same ill health effects as if they had smoked regular cigarettes.id.
mclaughlin also rejected the theory that the cigarette manufacturers distorted the body of public information as a whole.id.at.in advancing this theory,the mclaughlin plaintiffs invoked the presumption established in the context of the securities market.because misrepresentations by securities issuers affect the price of those securities when they are traded on the open market,and because investors view the market price of securities as an accurate measure of value,investor reliance upon public misrepresentations by securities issuers is presumed.mclaughlin refused to extend this presumption into the consumer market for cigarettes,explaining that the market for consumer goods is anything but efficient,as demonstrated by the fact that publication of monographs explaining that light cigarettes were no healthier than regular cigarettes produced no change in either the sales or the price of light cigarettes.id.at.
the district court believed that mclaughlin was distinguis
