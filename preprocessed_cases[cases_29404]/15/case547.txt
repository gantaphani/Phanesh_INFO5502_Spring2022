appellants peter and annah gaona appeal an order of the district court granting town country credit and chase manhattan bank summary judgment on all claims.the gaonas first argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their truth in lending act claim.they contend that their loan was not consummated on january,that town country listed the incorrect final date for rescission on the notice of right to cancel form,and that because this notice was inaccurate,they are entitled to an extended period to rescind.second,they claim that the district court erred in borrowing the statute of limitations from the minnesota human rights act and applying it to the gaonas title iii americans with disabilities act claim.they argue that the court should have instead borrowed the minnesota statute of limitations for personal injury actions.finally,the gaonas claim that the district court erred in concluding that section of the fair housing act and related regulations do not require a lender to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled borrowers.see b.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the truth in lending act and fair housing act claims,but reverse its entry of summary judgment against the gaonas on their americans with disabilities act claim.
the plaintiffs in this case,annah and peter gaona,are married and live in coon rapids,minnesota,a suburb of the twin cities.the gaonas are both deaf,and their primary method of communicating is through american sign language.in january,the gaonas met with loan officer johnna giguere at town country branch office in new brighton,minnesota to apply for a residential mortgage loan.the gaonas contend that during this first meeting,they asked,in writing,for an interpreter and that none was provided.instead,the gaonas communicated with giguera and others at town country primarily through written notes back and forth.the gaonas met again with giguere and with richard perkins,another bank official,at the new brighton branch on january,and signed the loan documents,including the mortgage agreement,promissory note,loan program disclosure,borrower acknowledgment of final terms,notice of the right to cancel,and acknowledgment of conditional loan consummation.the loan was funded and the money was disbursed on february.town country then assigned the mortgage to chase bank of texas on february.the gaonas defaulted on the loan sometime during,and in november,chase attempted to foreclose on the gaonas house.the gaonas then sent chase notice of their intent to rescind the mortgage on november.town country responded that the gaonas had received all of the required notices and declined to rescind.the gaonas then brought suit in ramsey county,minnesota.the state court enjoined the foreclosure pending resolution of the gaonas claims,and defendants removed the case to federal court.in their first amended complaint,the gaonas alleged that town country and chase violated the truth in lending act tila,the americans with disabilities act ada,and the fair housing act fha among other claims.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of town country and chase on all claims.
the gaonas argue that town country violated the rescission provision of the truth in lending act.they claim that their mortgage loan was not consummated on the closing date of january,because the loan was conditioned on an appraisal review and the terms of the agreement were indefinite they further contend that if the loan was not consummated on january,then the notice of the right to rescind listed an incorrect date of january,as the last day for rescission,a defect which the gaonas claim should give them an extended right to rescind.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standards that the district court used in its consideration of the summary judgment motion.reich conagra,cir.we must examine the record in the light most favorable to the party,giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences to be drawn from the facts.id.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.c.
the truth in lending act provides the borrower with the right to rescind within a limited time frame.it states,the borrower shall have the right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the third business day following the consummation of the transaction or the delivery of the information and rescission forms required under this section whichever is later a.the lender must provide each customer entitled to rescind with two copies of the notice of the right to rescind.b.this notice should include the date that the rescission period ends.b.
if the required notice or material disclosures are not delivered,the right to rescind is extended to as much as three years from the consummation of the loan.a.consummation occurs on the date that a consumer becomes contractually obligated on a credit transaction.a.the borrower obligations are defined by the terms of the contract with reference to state law.b.
the gaonas argue first that they did not participate in a closing on january,because,according to a document titled acknowledgment of conditional loan consummation,the loan was conditioned on a satisfactory appraisal review.since this appraisal did not take place until january,the gaonas claim that the rescission period should have expired three days after that date.
as mentioned above,the applicable regulations define consummation as the point at which the consumer becomes contractually obligated.a.we agree with the district court that a condition precedent to the lender performance does not affect the consumer obligation,and indeed,such a condition precedent also does not mean that the lender is not contractually obligated.gaona town country credit,rle,wl,at.the document relied upon by the gaonas clearly informed them that despite this condition,the loan was consummated.the appraisal review notwithstanding,the gaonas became contractually obligated when the loan documents were executed on january,
second,the gaonas contend that the terms of the loan remained indefinite and point to the document titled interest rate disclosure which states the interest rate and terms of your loan are not locked in the interest rate and terms applicable to your loan remain subject to change until the date the loan is actually funded.however,this form was dated january,two weeks before the mortgage documents were executed it remained unsigned by the gaonas and there is no evidence that town country attempted to change the interest rate or terms of the loan prior to funding.when the gaonas executed the promissory note on january,the interest rate and other terms of the loan were specified and definite.we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to town country on the truth in lending act claim.
the gaonas also claim that the district court erred in applying the statute of limitations from the minnesota human rights act mhra to their ada claim.the gaonas contend that the district court should have instead borrowed the minnesota statute of limitations for personal injury cases.
when a federal law has no statute of limitations,courts may borrow the most closely analogous state statute of limitations,unless doing so would frustrate the policy embodied in the federal law.birmingham omaha sch,cir.the district court held that the public discrimination provisions of the mhra,subd,were almost identical to those of title iii of the ada,b a.thus,it applied the statute of limitations under the mhra and found the gaonas claim untimely.see,subd.we review de novo the district court decision to borrow a particular state statute of limitations.birmingham,at.
in wilson garcia,d,the supreme court addressed the question of how to select the most appropriate or most analogous state statute of limitations to apply to a claim.the court held first,that the federal interest in uniformity and the interest in having firmly defined,easily applied rules made the selection of the appropriate statute of limitations a question of federal law,id.at.sec
