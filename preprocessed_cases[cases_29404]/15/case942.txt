plaintiff jess mexia sued rinker boat company,rinker and miller landing miller for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability under the consumer warranty act,et the act.in essence,mexia alleged that he purchased from miller a boat manufactured by rinker that was unmerchantable due to a latent defect,which subsequently caused the boat engine to corrode.he commenced his action within four years after purchasing the boat.
in support of their demurrer to the complaint,rinker and miller asserted that civil code section,subdivision c a provision of the act that defines the duration of the implied warranty of a statute of limitations that bars mexia claim the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.after judgment was entered in favor of rinker and miller,mexia appealed.
on appeal,rinker and miller concede that the duration provision is not a statute of limitations and that the applicable statute of limitations is four years.they argue,however,that the judgment can be affirmed on other grounds.among other arguments,they contend that the duration provision of the act should be interpreted as barring an action for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability when the purchaser fails to discover and report the defect to the seller within the time period specified in that provision.we reject this argument because the plain language of the statute,particularly in light of the consumer protection policies supporting the act,make clear that the statute merely creates a limited,prospective duration for the implied warranty of merchantability it does not create a deadline for discovering latent defects or for giving notice to the seller.because we also reject rinker and miller other arguments,we reverse the judgment.

background 
under the act,every retail sale of consumer goods sold in california includes an implied warranty by the manufacturer and the retail seller that the goods are merchantable unless the goods are expressly sold as is or with all faults.merchantability,for purposes of the act,means that the consumer goods pass without objection in the trade under the contract description.are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.are adequately contained,packaged,and labeled.and conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label.the core test of merchantability is fitness for the ordinary purpose for which such goods are used.citation.citations.isip usa,llc th,d.such fitness is shown if the product is in safe condition and substantially free of defects id.at,d.
when there has been a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability,a buyer may bring an action for the recovery of damages and other legal and equitable relief,subd.a.mocek alfa leisure,th,d mocek.
although the uniform commercial code provides a similar warranty of merchantability,its provisions proved limited in providing effective recourse to a consumer dissatisfied with a purchase.krieger nick alexander imports,d.krieger.in order to provide greater protections and remedies for consumers,the legislature enacted the act.robertson fleetwood travel trailers of california,th,d.it is strongly and makes clear its remedies are in addition to those available to a consumer pursuant to the uniform commercial code murillo fleetwood enterprises,cal th,d.to the extent that the act gives rights to the buyers of consumer goods,it prevails over conflicting provisions of the uniform commercial code.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.sales,citing.
one innovation of the act is an express provision for a duration of the implied warranty of merchantability,subd.c.the uniform commercial code,by contrast,did not expressly set forth a duration of the warranty.however,in order to prove a breach of the implied warranty,the purchaser was required to show that the defect existed at the time the product was sold or delivered.white summers,uniform commercial code ed,see,makuc american honda motor cir,hargett midas international so d.in effect,therefore,there is no duration of the implied warranty under the uniform commercial code in any meaningful sense the product is either merchantable or not and a breach of the implied warranty occurs or not only at the time of delivery.see,subd.
the duration provision in the act provides that the duration of the implied warranty of merchantability shall be coextensive in duration with an express warranty which accompanies the consumer goods,provided the duration of the express warranty is reasonable but in no event shall such implied warranty have a duration of less than days nor more than one year following the sale of new consumer goods to a retail buyer.where no duration for an express warranty is stated with respect to consumer goods,or parts thereof,the duration of the implied warranty shall be the maximum period prescribed above,subd.c.by defining a duration for the implied warranties under the act,the legislature arguably made an improvement in clarity over the uniform commercial code,which says nothing about their duration except that a cause of action for their breach accrues upon delivery.comment,consumer warranty law in california under the commercial code and the and warranty acts ucla,fn.omitted.
the implied warranty of merchantability may be breached by a latent defect undiscoverable at the time of sale.see moore hubbard johnson lumber d,brittalia ventures stuke nursery,th,d garlock sealing technologies,llc nak sealing technologies th,d.indeed,u ndisclosed latent defects are the very evil that the implied warranty of merchantability was designed to remedy.willis mining,noggle.in the case of a latent defect,a product is rendered unmerchantable,and the warranty of merchantability is breached,by the existence of the unseen defect,not by its subsequent discovery.this distinction is explained in moore.in that case,a defendant sold lumber to a contractor for use in the construction of a building.moore hubbard johnson lumber,supra,at.the lumber was infested with beetles that would eat their way out of the wood,leaving holes in the wood.id.at.the lumber was sold with an implied warranty of merchantability,which was sufficiently broad to impose liability if the goods contain an impurity of such a nature as to render them unusable and therefore unsaleable,for the general uses and purposes of goods of the kind described.burr sherwin williams cal d.id.at.the court adopted the trial court explanation of how this rule applied when the alleged defect is latent since this defect was hidden it was in the nature of a latent defect.further,there was evidence that if such a defect were known the lumber would be discarded as not being of the quality described in the sales contract.in such a case the lumber would be unusable and unsalable.applying the rationale of the burr case,supra,such goods would not be merchantable.further,it is usually stated that the goods must be such that with the defects known they would be salable as goods of the general kind which were described or supposed to be when bought.citations.as has been pointed out,if this defect were known they would not have been salable as goods of the general kind which were described.they would not measure up to the description given by the purchaser,and hence would breach the implied warranty of merchantability.id.at.thus,although a defect may not be discovered for months or years after a sale,merchantability is evaluated as if the defect were known.
the act does not include its own statute of limitations.krieger,supra,d at.california courts have held that the statute of limitations for an action for breach of warranty under the act is governed by the same statute that governs the statute of limitations for warranties arising under the uniform commercial code section of the uniform commercial code.krieger,supra,at.jensen bmw of north america,th,d carrau marvin lumber cedar th,d.under this statute,an action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued a cause of action accrues when the breach occurs,regardless of the aggrieved party lack of knowledge of the breach.a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made,except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered,subds.
rinker and miller statute of limitations argument 
in support of its demurrer before the trial court,rinker and miller argued that the duration provision of the act constitutes a statute of limitations for breach of implied warranty claims.because mexia commenced this action more than one year after purchasing the boat,the defendants asserted,his action is barred.the trial court apparently accepted this argument and sustained the demurrer.
rinker and miller do not repeat the same argument on appeal.they now concede that the statute of limitations for an action for breach of warranty under the act is four years pursuant to section of the uniform commercial code see krieger,supra,d at.jensen bmw of north america,supra,th at,d.under that statute,a cause of action for breach of warranty accrues,at the earliest,upon tender of delivery,subd.thus,the earliest date the implied warranty of merchantability regarding mexia boat could have accrued was the date mexia purchased,because he filed this action three years seven months after that date,he did so within the limitations period.therefore,mexia action is not barred by a statute of limitations.
on appeal,rinker asserts a statute of limitations argument different from the argument it made below.it argues that it had expressly limited the time to bring an action to six months after the expiration of its express warranty rinker refers us to its written limited warranty,which states no action to enforce this limited warranty shall be commenced later than six months after expiration of this limited warranty.the argument is without merit.mexia is not suing rinker to enforce its express limited warranty it is suing rinker for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability,which arises by operation of law and has a statute of limitations.the contractual period to enforce the express warranty is inapplicable here.
d.the duration provision and other arguments 
in the principal argument asserted in their brief,rinker and miller emphasize that mexia did not notify them of any problem with the boat or bring the boat in for repairs until more than two years after the purchase of the sale.they rely upon sections and of the uniform commercial code.section,along with section,gives a buyer a right to reject nonconforming goods prior to acceptance and thereby avoid any obligation to pay the purchase price,subd.c.the rejection must occur within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender of the goods,subd.section requires a buyer of goods to notify the seller of any breach within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the breach,subd.a.
these notification requirements,however,do not apply to an action brought under the act.krotin porsche cars north america,th,d.in contrast to the uniform commercial code,the act contains no reasonable time requirement by which the consumer must invoke the act or lose rights granted by that statutory scheme.krotin porsche cars north america,inc,supra,at,d.nor is there any requirement that the buyer allow the seller or manufacturer an opportunity to repair the product prior to bringing an action for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.mocek,supra,th at,d.moreover,even if uniform commercial code sections and might apply in some case arising under the act,they have no application here mexia claim is not based upon an alleged rejection of miller tender of the boat to mexia.and even if section governing notification of breach applied to mexia act claim,mexia alleged that he notified rinker and miller of the breach within a reasonable time after his discovery of the breach,an allegation we must assume is true for purposes of a demurrer.finally,in cases arising under the uniform commercial code,where such notification is required,the question of whether the buyer notified the seller of a breach within a reasonable time is usually a question of fact that can not be decided at the pleading stage.see fitl strek,stores,wheeler,see also fieldstone briggs plumbing products,th,d the question of whether notice was reasonable must be determined from the particular circumstances and,where but one inference can be drawn from undisputed facts,the issue may be determined as a matter of law.whitfield jessup cal d,applying former,what constitutes reasonable time depends upon the particular circumstances.
rinker and miller further assert that the boat was fit for its ordinary purpose since mexia did not seek repair from the defendants until over two years from the time of purchase.they appear to argue that the delay in seeking repairs after the defect was disc
