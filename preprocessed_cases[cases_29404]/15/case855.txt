in this class action,the class representatives alleged defendant restoration hardware,rhi,committed numerous violations of civil code section,also known as the song beverly credit card act.after a bench trial,the trial court found rhi was liable for as many as violations of that statute and set a penalty recovery in the amount of per violation,subject to rhi right to dispute any specific claim.under that judgment,rhi faced a total maximum liability of.
in posttrial proceedings,class representatives requested the court order an award of attorney fees of percent of the total maximum fund of created by the judgment to be payable to class counsel from the fund.rhi agreed it would not contest that request.francesca muller,a class member and the person prosecuting the present appeal,requested the court order notice of the attorney fee motion be sent to all class members.the court denied muller request,granted the attorney fee motion,and entered judgment in the action.muller then filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.
muller asserts the court erred when it declined to order that notice be given to all class members of the hearing on the attorney fee award,and that the award was calculated in violation of applicable standards and procedures.muller also claims the court award was an abuse of its discretion.class representative hernandez asserts muller does not have standing to appeal the judgment and that the appeal should therefore be dismissed.hernandez alternatively argues no notice to the class of the attorney fee hearing was mandated and the amount awarded as fees,as well as the procedure employed by the trial court for determining the amount of the attorney fees award,was proper.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the class action 
michael hernandez filed this action in alleging defendant rhi violated civil code section by requesting and recording zip codes from consumers who used a credit card in purchase transactions in rhi california retail stores.after years of litigation,the court ultimately certified the case as a class action,appointed michael hernandez and amanda georgino as class representatives together hernandez,and appointed patterson law group and stonebarger law as counsel for the class.
the june notice to potential class members advised them of the pending class action and explained they had the option of remaining as part of the class and being bound by the judgment,or excluding themselves from the class and not being bound by any judgment.it also advised that,if they elected to remain in the class,they had the option of entering an appearance through counsel.two weeks later,attorney schonbrun entered an appearance in the action on behalf of muller.however,muller did not move to intervene in the action,or to join as an additional class representative,or to be substituted for michael hernandez and amanda georgino as class representative.
b.the verdict and common fund award 
after a bench trial,the court issued its decision in favor of the class.the court found rhi committed as many as violations of section,subdivision a,for credit card transactions that occurred during the class period because rhi requested,obtained and recorded the customer zip code as part of the credit card transaction the court also concluded the appropriate penalty under section,subdivision e,for each violation would be,for a total recovery by the class of up to.
because the court decision ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding an appropriate claims process,the parties met and agreed on a claims process,and a process for distributing the total award the claims procedures.the parties stipulation proposed the final judgment award of be treated as a common fund inclusive of any attorneys fees,costs,and class representative enhancements subsequently ordered by the court,and also include administrative costs associated with administering the claims process.the parties proposed that,after deduction of attorney fees,costs,and class representative enhancements,the net remaining fund the net fund would be distributed to class members as a prorated share of the net fund up to per violation cash payment to persons submitting valid claims and who elected cash payments,and the coupon option to persons submitting valid claims if they did not elect the cash award for percent off of an up to purchase of nonexcluded rhi merchandise valid for one year from issuance of the coupon.the parties proposal also contained a provision that,at the end of coupon period,if the payouts from the net fund in cash or from coupon savings did not exhaust the net fund,an additional coupon would be issued with a dollar cap sufficient to exhaust the net fund.
c.the attorney fees determination 
hernandez subsequently moved for an attorney fees award seeking an award of attorney fees equivalent to percent of the total judgment recovered for the class the court,although acknowledging a percentage award might ultimately be the appropriate method to calculate the fee award,also directed class counsel to supplement the motion for fees with a filing that employed a traditional lodestar calculation.hernandez subsequently submitted the lodestar calculation and analysis,which showed class counsel had spent over hours,totaling nearly million in costs advanced and fees incurred,and detailed the attorneys involved,the tasks performed,and the reasonableness of the hourly rates for those attorneys.hernandez submission also articulated the reasons that supported application of a multiplier to the lodestar calculation.
muller,who was served with the attorney fee motions,did not file any objection contesting the propriety of the amount sought by hernandez as attorney fees.instead,muller filed an august,request for clarification,asking for clarification on whether class members would receive notice of the fee application and the right to appear and comment on the application prior to the hearing on the attorney fees,the court issued its tentative ruling determining a percentage award in a common fund case was permitted by california law,a percent fee was a percentage courts use as a starting benchmark,and a fee at or above that benchmark was particularly appropriate considering the risks undertaken,and results obtained,by counsel in this action.
at the hearing on the attorney fee application,muller objected that considering the attorney fees application without first giving class members notice of the fee application and the right to appear and comment on the application was a violation of class action procedures because this fee award was a settlement as regards to the attorneys fees because class counsel and defendants negotiated a settlement on the question of attorneys fees.muller also argued,for the first time at the hearing,that a court must use the lodestar multiplier approach rather than a percentage of the fund approach when calculating the fee award,but did not argue the amount the court tentative ruling proposed to award was excessive.
d.the judgment 
the court final judgment,which apparently tracked the parties proposed claims procedures process,provided for awarding,to be treated as a common fund inclusive of any attorneys fees,costs,and class representative incentive enhancements ordered by the court and any administrative costs associated with administering the claims process the court awarded attorney fees of,or percent of the total maximum fund of created by the judgment,as well as litigation costs and class representative incentive enhancements,and directed the remainder of the fund less administrative costs of administering the claims process be distributed as specified by the judgment.muller filed her notice of appeal within the time specified by law.
muller raises numerous claims of alleged error in the judgment entered below.first,she claims the court could not adjudicate the attorney fee motion without first giving notice to the class of hernandez motion to set the appropriate attorney fee award,and giving all class members an opportunity to object to the motion,and the failure to do so in this case violated both due process protections and california class action procedures.second,muller argues the court,by calculating the award based on a percentage of the common fund rather than by a properly rigorous lodestar multiplier approach,transgressed controlling california precedent.finally,muller argues class counsel breached its fiduciary duty to the class by negotiating with rhi over the amount of fees to be paid by the common fund.
hernandez contests each of muller claims of error.however,hernandez raises a jurisdictional challenge to this court ability to entertain the appeal,arguing that because muller was neither a party nor aggrieved by the judgment,she does not have standing to pursue this appeal and the appeal must therefore be dismissed.because this claim is jurisdictional life county of los angeles d,fn.standing to appeal is jurisdictional in re marriage of tushinsky d,we begin with our analysis of whether muller may prosecute this appeal.
general principles 
only a party aggrieved may appeal from a judgment.code civ.as a general rule,only parties of record may appeal county of alameda carleson cal d,and the courts have interpreted section to require the appellant both to have been a party below and to have been aggrieved by the judgment.see,marsh mountain zephyr,th,to have standing to appeal,a person generally must be both a party of record and sufficiently aggrieved by the judgment or order marsh.
a class action is one prosecuted by named representative plaintiffs,who have a fiduciary responsibility to prosecute the action on behalf of the absent parties.earley superior court th.the class action structure relieves the unnamed class members of the burden of participating in the action,hiring counsel,and incurring costs.ibid.indeed,t he structure of the class action does not allow absent class members to become active parties,since to the extent the absent class members are compelled to participate in the trial of the lawsuit,the effectiveness of the class action device is destroyed.although unnamed class members may be deemed parties for the limited purposes of discovery southern california edison superior court cal d,unnamed class members are not otherwise considered parties to the litigation.national solar equipment owners grumman d,unnamed class members do not stand on the same footing as named parties.
hernandez argues that,because muller is not a party,the appeal should be dismissed under eggert pac.states cal d eggert in eggert,the court addressed whether an unnamed class member could appeal from a judgment entered in the class action.there,the named plaintiff eggert commenced an action against the savings and loan company on behalf of himself and some persons who were certificate holders.the court held the suit a proper class action,and in its judgment for eggert and the other certificate holders whom he represented decreed that they recover from the defendant over million to be apportioned pro rata among them after deduction of expenses and fees,and reserved jurisdiction to determine the fees to be paid plaintiff attorneys.after appointing a receiver to facilitate the collection and payment of the judgment,the court also issued an order,directed to plaintiff and all other persons interested,to show cause why it should not make an order fixing reasonable attorneys fees.two certificate holders appeared and objected to the amount ordered as attorneys fees for plaintiff attorneys,and subsequently appealed from the order rejecting their objections.eggert,supra,cal d at.the class representative moved to dismiss the appeal,and our supreme court granted the motion to dismiss the appeal,explaining it is a settled rule of practice in this state that only a party to the record can appeal.citations.appellants were not named as parties to the action nor did they take any appropriate steps to become parties to the record.the fact that their names and the extent of their interest in the action appeared in an exhibit attached to the complaint and the judgment did not make them parties citations.although their attorney appeared at the hearing on the petition for the payment of the money to plaintiff attorneys and objected to such payment,he did not ask that appellants be made parties,nor did the court order them brought into the action.citation.appellants had ample opportunity even after the court had made its orders to become parties of record by moving to vacate the orders to which they objected.they could then have appealed from the order denying the motion.eggert,at.accordingly,the supreme court ordered the appeal dismissed.ibid.
eggert appears to be on all fours with the present action both involved a class action both involved a matter litigated to judgment both involved a challenge to the postjudgment attorney fee award to the counsel for the named plaintiff both involved appellants who were members of the class,but not named parties,and who had appeared through counsel to object to the attorney fee award and both involved members who took no steps to be added as named plaintiffs accordingly,under auto equity sales,superior court cal d,we must adhere to eggert and dismiss the appeal.
muller argues we may disregard eggert and entertain this appeal,but we are unpersuaded by her arguments.muller argues,for example,that eggert was decided before the revisions to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and those federal rules are persuasive in modern california class action jurisprudence see,arias superior court cal th,conc.opn.by werdeger,and because eggert predated those rule changes it is no longer relevant to the issue of appellate standing.however,muller cites no authority suggesting that changes to federal procedural rules for managing class actions at trial undermine the analysis of a state statute that limits the standing of parties entitled to appeal,and we are aware of no relevant authority that does so.
muller also cites several cases in which california appellate courts stated a class member who was not a party to the action obtains appellate standing to challenge the judgment merely by interposing an objection to the judgment below.however,neither of the cases cited by muller,consumer cause,gooch natural food markets,th and wershba apple computer,th,made any effort to reconcile their conclusions with eggert,and instead rooted their conclusions in the analysis contained in trotsky los angeles fed.sav.loan d trotsky.see wershba,at citing only trotsky on issue of standing consumer cause,at citing trotsky and wershba on issue of standing.accordingly,we examine trotsky.
in trotsky,the appellants were unnamed members of the affected class who appeared at a settlement hearing and objected to a proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit.trotsky,discussing the standing to appeal issue,stated 
a ppellant is a party aggrieved,and has standing to appeal.citing code of civil procedure section.this is true even though appellant could instead have opted out,requested exclusion from the judgment.citation.as stated by the court in ace heating plumbing crane cir,deciding a similar question under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,it is possible that,within a class,a group of small claimants might be unfavorably treated by the terms of a proposed settlement.for them,the option to join is in reality no option at all.rule recognizes the fact that many small claimants frequently have no litigable claims unless aggregated.so,without court approval and a subsequent right to ask for review,such claimants would be faced with equally unpalatable alternatives accept either nothing at all or a possibly unfair settlement.we conclude that appellants have standing to appeal citations.were the rule otherwise,a class member who objected in the trial court to the terms of the settlement would be unable to secure appellate review of the court order approving the settlement.trotsky,supra,d at.
thus,trotsky focused primarily on whether an objector to a settlement was aggrieved within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,concluding objectors were aggrieved because i t is possible that,within a class,a group of small claimants might be unfavorably treated by the terms of a proposed settlement.for them,
