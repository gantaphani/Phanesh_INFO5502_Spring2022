background 
this appeal arises from a trademark dispute between two businesses that offer physical therapy services in new york city.except where noted,the facts are undisputed.
since,pro fitness has offered physical therapy services using the designation pro fitness and under the name pro fitness sports medicine physical therapy center.it has held a registered federal trademark for the pro fitness designation since and has one office in brooklyn and two in manhattan.according to pro fitness,its primary or home market is manhattan.
in january,started to offer the same physical therapy services as plaintiff under the name pro fit physical therapy,through an office in bayside,queens.in april,opened its first manhattan office,which was followed by a second manhattan office in march.claims that it was present in manhattan,even when it only had an office in queens,because it held seminars in manhattan,served clients in and beyond queens,belonged to a referral service,and received referrals from many doctors located outside of queens.
pro fitness claims that it first became aware of in or about march,approximately three months after defendant began operating.in june,through counsel,pro fitness sent a cease and desist letter.in that letter,plaintiff counsel represented that use of the term constitutes trademark infringement and unfair competition,and demanded that immediately cease and desist from any and all use of defendant alleged mark.in the event that refuses to comply,the letter continued,we have been authorized to institute court action to prevent further violation of our clients rights.
in response,counsel stated in a letter that they did not believe that our clients sic use of physical therapy is an infringement on your clients sic trademark rights.however,defendant counsel further stated,in light of the similarity between the names and in an effort to avoid any confusion or further conflict,our clients have decided to change their corporate identity to profit orthopedic and sports physical therapy.
this effort at accommodation was met by silence.informed pro fitness in a letter sent shortly after the first one that a hyphen was mistakenly omitted for.noted that t o this date we have not had any response regarding our proposed name change.reiterating intent to avoid any future conflict,counsel concluded that i n the event that you do not respond,we will proceed as planned with our change of corporate name.receiving no response from pro fitness,changed its name to orthopedic and sports physical therapy,
more than a year later,sometime around september,pro fitness claims that it learned that had opened an office in manhattan.in a letter dated september,pro fitness threatened with immediate legal action unless immediately stopped using its allegedly offending mark.refused to comply.on december,pro fitness received a letter from an insurance company that concerned one of its patients but was addressed to.pro fitness claims that three similar instances of confusion followed,including a similarly misaddressed letter sent to pro fitness by a law firm.
in january,pro fitness began this lawsuit.in its complaint,plaintiff claims that the defendant name is confusingly similar to plaintiff name pro fitness and that defendant use of that name in offering identical services is likely to confuse the public.seeking both monetary damages and injunctive relief,plaintiff asserts claims of trademark infringement,trademark dilution,and unfair competition under the lanham act,as well as a related state law claim.
defendant moved for summary judgment,asserting the equitable defenses of estoppel by acquiescence and laches.at a hearing before the district court,defendant argued principally that plaintiff,by failing to respond to proposed name change,acquiesced in defendant doing business under that name.in response to the claim of acquiescence,pro fitness argued that,under the doctrine of progressive encroachment,it had properly waited to assert its claims until,following defendant expansion into plaintiff home market of manhattan,instances of actual confusion occurred.
ruling from the bench,the district court granted defendant motion for summary judgment.finding that plaintiff had acquiesced and that new york city was all one market for physical therapy services,the district court rejected plaintiff progressive encroachment theory and held that its suit was barred by both acquiescence and laches.
because the district court had limited the parties submissions to the issues of acquiescence and laches,it expressly declined to consider the likelihood of confusion,which it thought to be unrelated.however,in light of its finding of some instances of actual confusion in the record and to avoid the possibility of confusion later on,the court ordered each party to use a legend in its advertising and other public references to its businesses stating that it and its staff are not affiliated in any way with the other party.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,pro fitness raises numerous objections to the district court judgment and remedy.pro fitness denies that its failure to respond to defendant proposed change of name constituted acquiescence to the use of that name.plaintiff also argues that there are disputed facts precluding summary judgment concerning whether manhattan and queens were the same market for physical therapy services and whether defendant expansion of its business,particularly from queens into manhattan,amounted to progressive encroachment on plaintiff home market.in addition,plaintiff argues that the district court erred in rejecting plaintiff progressive encroachment claim without inquiring into the likelihood of public confusion of the parties marks.finally,pro fitness contends that the district court abused its discretion by ordering both parties to adopt a disclaimer.
