defendants,imergent,and its subsidiary,storesonline,are providers of ecommerce technology,training,and other programs that purport to help start,operate,and maintain businesses.recognizing the danger that such products and services present to unsophisticated purchasers,california enacted the seller assisted marketing plan samp act,et among other things,this legislation imposes a duty on the seller of samp to make certain disclosures to the attorney general and the prospective purchasers,and provides a procedure for the purchaser to cancel any contract for the sale of a samp.the law applies to all sellers who represent that the purchaser will earn,is likely to earn,or can earn an amount in excess of the initial payment paid by the purchaser for participation in the seller assisted marketing plan,subd.a.defendants contend that this phrase is unconstitutionally vague.as we shall explain,the words to which defendants object can not,in any rational way,be construed as failing to provide adequate notice of the conduct that triggers the requirements of the samp act.the statute,sub judice,gives the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,so that he may act accordingly williams garcetti cal th,d.defendants contention is further called into question by the stipulated judgment and permanent injunction,entered in a prior action less than a year before the instant complaint was filed,in which they agreed to refrain from violating the very act whose clarity of language they now question.
defendants appeal from an order granting a motion for a preliminary injunction filed by the attorney general and the ventura county district attorney on behalf of the people of the state of california plaintiffs.the injunction prohibits defendants from selling their products and services without first complying with the disclosure provisions of the samp act and the unfair competition law ucl bus.defendants contend the order granting the injunction must be reversed because the samp act is unconstitutionally vague on its face.they alternatively claim the trial court abused its discretion in issuing a mandatory injunction that prohibits them from engaging in lawful conduct.we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
defendants sell a package of services and products that purport to assist in the establishment of internet businesses or,as defendants put it,a fully functional ecommerce website.defendants market these services and products by conducting sales presentations at hotels and conference centers throughout the united states.consumers are solicited by mail with offers of free gifts and meals to attend an initial presentation.those who attend are invited to pay to attend what defendants characterize as a internet marketing training workshop valued at.plaintiff contends this workshop is actually a vigorous sales pitch for defendants internet storefronts,website design and internet marketing services.
during the second presentation,defendants offer packages containing either three or six licenses for websites,at costs ranging from to.customers are encouraged to purchase the more expensive package,regardless of whether they have any business experience or a product to sell.both presentations include numerous testimonials from prior customers who claim to have earned large incomes using defendants products.as of july,defendants website included several such testimonials,all of which included representations that the customer had recouped his initial investment.
similar representations were made at sales presentations held in pasadena,van nuys,and oxnard in.for example,one speaker represented that the average successful merchant on storesonline replaces their entire income and on average works two hours a day.another speaker stated that while all testimonials are not earnings claims and you could make less money than my examples today,by the same token,you can make,what more and a lot more.
in december,defendants conducted two sales seminars in the city of ventura,at which consumers purchased defendants products.plaintiffs located and interviewed of these individuals in may.most had purchased six websites at a cost of to,and almost all had spent a considerable amount of time up to hundreds of hours attempting to start businesses.of the were unable to even activate any websites,and the remaining three generated less than in sales.
in,plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants alleging violations of the samp act,the ucl,and the false advertising law fal bus,et.in conjunction with the filing of the complaint,the parties stipulated to a final judgment in which defendants agreed to pay over million in restitution and costs.defendants were also permanently enjoined from selling or offering to sell samp prior to timely filing the required disclosures with the attorney general without providing data substantiating any claims regarding the samp income or earning potential to prospective purchasers at the first communication and without providing other disclosures and information to potential purchasers as provided in the samp act.defendants were also required to provide plaintiff with advance notice of the time,place and location of any seminars to be held in california,and to comply with any requests for copies of the invitations used to market the seminars and audio recordings of those seminars.
on july,approximately months after the stipulated judgment and permanent injunction were filed in the prior action,plaintiff filed the instant complaint alleging that defendants had violated the stipulated final judgment in the prior action,the samp act,the ucl,and the fal.the allegations in the complaint were based on information obtained by investigators who attended sales presentations,as well as a review of defendants current marketing materials and website.on august,the trial court issued a temporary restraining order tro under authority of business and professions code sections and that was substantially identical to the permanent injunction filed in the prior action.
on august,defendants filed a petition for a writ of supersedeas in this court challenging the tro.while that petition was pending,the trial court issued a preliminary injunction containing the same restrictions as the tro.we subsequently denied the writ petition challenging the tro.defendants filed a second writ petition challenging the preliminary injunction,which we denied on october.this appeal followed.
discussion 
of the samp act 
the samp act defines a samp as any sale or lease or offer to sell or lease any product,equipment,supplies,or services that requires a total initial payment exceeding five hundred dollars,but requires an initial cash payment of less than fifty thousand dollars,that will aid a purchaser or will be used by or on behalf of the purchaser in connection with or incidental to beginning,maintaining,or operating a business when the seller assisted marketing plan seller has advertised or in any other manner solicited the purchase or lease of the seller assisted marketing plan and r epresented that the purchaser will earn,is likely to earn,or can earn an amount in excess of the initial payment paid by the purchaser for participation in the seller assisted marketing plan,subd.a,italics added.defendants contend that the foregoing italicized phrase is unconstitutionally vague on its face,and that the preliminary injunction enjoining their continued violations of the samp act must therefore be reversed.we reject this contention.
a statute is void for vagueness if persons of common intelligence must guess as to its meaning and differ as to its applications.citation.the doctrine reflects the principle that a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application,violates the first essential of due process of law.citation.the requirement that government articulate its aims with a reasonable degree of clarity ensures that state power will be exercised only on behalf of policies reflecting an authoritative choice among competing so
