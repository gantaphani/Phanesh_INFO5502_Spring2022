section of the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,a,imposes felony liability for misbranding with the intent to defraud or mislead.the question presented is whether this provision requires proof of materiality.we hold that materiality must be proven as an element of the offense under either a theory of intent to defraud or a theory of intent to mislead.
background 
jack watkins is the president and majority owner of cap tab nutritional formulating and manufacturing,a company that manufactures vitamins and nutritional supplements collectively,watkins.the subject of this appeal arises from watkins conditional guilty plea under the fdca following a indictment.the indictment charged watkins with conspiracy,mail fraud,wire fraud,and felony misbranding.according to the indictment,watkins manufactured nutritional supplements by purposefully omitting,substituting,or using lesser amounts of certain ingredients.specifically,the government alleged that one product,did not contain acetyl as labeled.rather,it contained,which was one of approximately six ingredients in the product.the government also claimed that two other products,neurotein and energy,did not contain chromium picolinate as labeled.rather,they contained chromium polyniconate,which was one of approximately eight ingredients in nuerotein and one of approximately fifteen ingredients in energy.the indictment further charged that watkins concealed these facts,knowing that his actions constituted false and misleading labeling.
before trial,the government filed a motion in limine,moving to exclude evidence that the substitutions were not mate rial.watkins responded by arguing that proof of materiality was required for conviction under the felony misbranding pro visions of a.watkins also claimed that he believed that his substitution of ingredients did not constitute a mate rial difference,despite admitting that he knew of the disparity between the labels and the actual ingredients.the district court granted the government motion to exclude evidence of materiality.the same day,pursuant to a plea agreement,watkins pled guilty to the three felony misbranding counts.the plea was conditioned upon the preservation of watkins right to appeal,under federal rule of criminal procedure a,the issue of whether materiality must be proven for a conviction for the offense of a felony charge of misbranding.
the district court sentenced watkins to five years supervised probation and imposed a fine.and watkins appealed separately we have consolidated their appeals.the sole legal issue,which we address de novo,is whether materiality constitutes an element of felony misbranding under the fdca.see united states steffen,cir united states douglass,cir.
discussion 
fdca overview 
the food,drug,and cosmetic act is a public welfare statute that imposes the highest standard of care on distributors.smith california,d.it was enacted to enable purchasers to make intelligent choices,and,to that end,m isbranding was one of the chief evils congress sought to stop.united states kg.drums of pure vegetable oil,cir.the misbranding provision prohibits t he introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food,drug,device,or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded.a.a food shall be deemed to be misbranded i f its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.a.
the fdca provides two tiers of liability for misbranding violations under a.the misdemeanor provision imposes criminal liability in the form of imprisonment,fines,or both.see a any person who violates a shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined not more than,or both.an article may be misbranded pursuant to the misdemeanor provision without any conscious fraud at all,thus creating a form of strict criminal liability.united states dotterweich.quoting united states johnson.felony misbranding,on the other hand,requires a showing that the defendant acted with intent to defraud or mislead 
notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph,if any person commits such a violation after a conviction of him under this section has become final,or commits such a violation with the intent to defraud or mislead,such person shall be imprisoned for not more than three years or fined not more than or both.
a emphasis added.thus,felony liability for misbranding requires an additional mens rea element that is absent from the misdemeanor provision.see united states mitcheltree,cir felony liability under a requires proof that defendant consciously sought to mislead authorities.the question we consider in this case is to what degree this additional element circumscribes felony liability for misbranding offenses.
ii.felony liability for misbranding requires proof of materiality 
watkins admits that he knew the labels on his nutritional supplements misrepresented the ingredients actually in the product.nonetheless,he argues that knowledge of falsity alone is not sufficient for conviction under a.watkins urges instead that intent to defraud or mislead means the misrepresentation would have a material effect on any decision to buy or consume the product,or the person who makes the misrepresentation has reason to believe that the misstatement would induce the reliance of others in making those decisions.thus,watkins argues on appeal that the district court erred in excluding evidence that he believed there was no material difference between the ingredients listed on the label and those actually in the product,and that buyers and consumers would perceive no such difference in choosing his product.the government responds that absent an explicit statutory requirement of materiality,the intent element for a is satisfied by simply proving knowledge of falsity.we disagree with the government reading of this provision.
intent to defraud 
our first charge is to divine the meaning of intend to defraud under a.we are mindful of the rule that a court should not read words into a statute that are not there.see aronsen crown zellerbach,cir it is consistent with the general principle of statutory construction that a court should not add language to an unambiguous statute absent a manifest error in drafting or unresolvable inconsistency.see also sutherland stat const.we do not do so.rather,by examining the settled meaning of intent to defraud,we conclude that this phrase requires materiality.our conclusion is compelled by the supreme court recent teaching in neder united states,d.
in neder,the court addressed whether a scheme or artifice to defraud under the federal mail,wire,and bank fraud statutes requires material falsehoods.observing that none of the fraud statutes defines the phrase scheme or artifice to defraud,or even mentions materiality,the court concluded that based solely on a natural reading of the full text,materiality would not be an element of the fraud statutes.at.citations omitted.the court analysis,however,did not end with this literal reading of the statutory language.rather,the court continued by looking to the meaning of defraud,invoking the rule of construction that w here congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under the common law,a court must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress means to incorporate the established meaning of those terms.id.at.quoting nationwide mut.ins.darden,d.surveying the settled meaning of fraud,the court concluded that the common law could not have conceived of fraud without proof of materiality.neder,at.citations omitted.in light of this settled meaning,the court held that it must presume that congress intended to incorporate materiality unless the statute otherwise dictates.id.at.
in this case,the government relies primarily on the eighth circuit decision in united states jorgensen,cir,to argue that materiality is not a requirement of a.in jorgensen,the court addressed a similar criminal misbranding provision of the federal meat inspection act,that makes misbranding a felony for any person who has an intent to defraud.see a.there,the court looked no further than the literal words of the statute and held that the statutory language does not require that the false or misleading statements be material.jorgensen,at.it reached this conclusion without examining the meaning of this language.considering this omission,we believe that the supreme court subsequent decision in neder settles the analytical framework for interpretation of intent to defraud.in neder,the court noted that an analysis based solely on a natural reading of the statutory language,does not end our inquiry.neder,at.citation omitted.rather,the court instructed that a necessary second step is examination of any settled meaning under the common law.id.this approach is a rejection of the literal analysis employed by the jorgenson court.
the government attempts to distinguish this case from neder by claiming that requiring proof of materiality for prosecution under a would frustrate congress purpose in passing the fdca to insure that the goods they offer for sale to the public were safe and properly labeled.this argument ignores the broad reach of the statute.the misdemeanor provision,a,covers a wide range of conduct,imposing strict liability for misbranding,and providing criminal any affirmative misrepresentations,whether knowingly false,fraudulent,or even unintentional.see united states park,d.in other words,any misbranding is a criminal offense.the increased penalties provided by a require an additional showing of an intent to defraud or,indicating congress intent to limit the scope of felony liability.considering the broad applicability of the misdemeanor misbranding provision and congress intent to limit liability for increased penalties,requiring proof of materiality would not frustrate congress purpose in enacting these provisions of the fdca to protect public health and safety.
nor does this requirement contradict our own admonition that congress fully intended that the fdca coverage be as broad as its literal language indicates.baker united states,cir quoting united states,d.rather,because congress expressly required proof of an intent to defraud for felony liability,we can not infer from the absence of an express reference to materiality that congress intended to drop that element from a.on the contrary,we must presume that congress intended to incorporate materiality unless the statute otherwise dictates.neder,at.internal quotations and citations omitted emphasis in original.the fdca broad coverage of criminal misbranding does not otherwise dictate.
intent to mislead 
although neder compels us to understand intent to defraud as requiring proof of materiality,we must consider the meaning of intend to mislead separately because courts are to accord a meaning,if possible,to every word in a statute.platt union pac.accord united states,cir.our examination of the plain meaning of this phrase as well as its settled meaning under the common law lead us to conclude that an intent to mislead also requires proof of materiality.that is,regardless of any additional liability congress intended to include with this language,one still can not intend to mislead another by means of a misrepresentation without having an expectation that the recipient would actually or reasonably rely on it.
we begin our analysis with an examination of plain meaning,for w here the language is plain and admits of no more than one meaning,the duty of interpretation does not arise,and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no discussion.caminetti united states.citation omitted accord negonsott samuels,d.to mislead is to lead in a wrong direction or into a mistaken belief deceive.webster new international dictionary ed.in turn,to deceive is to take unawares esp.by craft or trickery to cause to believe the false.id.at.both these definitions presume an effect on another party.this understanding is reinforced by the transitive nature of the verb to mislead.its action requires an this case another party.the addition of the word intent underscores the relationship between the actor and the other party.any intent to mislead presumes an expectation or purpose that another will in fact be misled.
the government would have us believe that an intent to mislead is established by showing mere knowledge of a statement falsity by its maker.to begin as a matter of plain meaning,an intent to have knowledge of a statement falsity makes little sense.likewise,when we consider the government proffered meaning,its reading is at once too narrow and too broad.it is too narrow because misbranding does not require a false label a misleading label is prohibited as well.drug or devise misbranded if labeling false or misleading in any particular.at the other end of the spectrum,the government interpretation is too broad because it would impose felony liability based solely on knowledge of a false label,no matter how insignificant the falsehood.simply put,knowledge of falsity places a focus on the actor and does not adequately encompass the effect of the intended action on the other party.
the government also argues that in the absence of a specific reference to materiality,we should not read this concept into a.it points to several other provisions in the fdca that prohibit misleading representations or omissions that are expressly material,thus urging us to infer congressional meaning through the absence of the term.see a b product subject to civil seizure if label would be in a material respect misleading to the injury or damage of the purchaser or consumer a dietary supplement may be deemed misbranded if its advertising is false or misleading in material respect n in determining whether label is misleading,must take into account material omissions.none of these examples persuade us to read intent to mislead against its plain meaning.
the structure of the statute supports the distinctions in the language used by congress.many statements,whether true,incomplete,or false,can be misleading even when the maker of the representation does not intend to mislead the recipient.for example,a drug is deemed misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.a.in other words,a label that is misleading in any respect may result in misdemeanor liability.section a goes on to explain that misleading labeling can include not just affirmative statements,but material omissions.the requirement of materiality functions to cabin potentially unlimited liability by imposing a more objective standard.see restatement second of torts a a matter is material if a reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action or the maker of the representation knows or has reason to know that the recipient is likely to consider the matter as important.thus,when intent is irrelevant to the imposition of is the case in the fdca provisions cited by the government requirement of materiality further limits liability to those circumstances where the consequences are significant.
even the government notes the need for limiting penalties to labeling omissions that are material because criminal misdemeanor liability otherwise would be unlimited when the universe of what has been omitted from the label would include essentially every other word in the english language.brief for united states.imposing liability where there is an intent to mislead,on the other hand,requires no such extrinsic limiting language whereas any statement could be potentially misleading under these other provisions without an express limitation,the only representations that will invoke felony liability are those that the maker expects,that is,intends,the recipient to rely upon.thus,congress had no need to include an express reference to materiality where liability is founded upon intent.
one final point of plain meaning bears congress intended to impose felony liability,as the government suggests,simply for making knowingly false statements in labeling,then it easily could have used such language in the statute.see,a imposing civil penalties for certain false statements knowingly made or caused to be made to officials.instead,congress chose to impose liability when the maker of the misrepresentation does so with the intent to defraud or mislead.because this language presupposes a desired effect on a third party,an e
