an organization representing disabled individuals sued an operator of retail department stores for maintaining narrow pathways between merchandise display racks that block shoppers with wheelchairs and other mobility aids from reaching the merchandise.in a bench trial,the court found that the retailer denied access to disabled individuals but concluded that widening the merchandise pathways to allow access was not legally mandated because wider pathways would cause a significant loss of selling space and profit.the court also found that the retailer provided an adequate alternative method for making its merchandise available to disabled individuals by designing new and remodeled stores to be physically accessible.the court entered judgment for the retailer.
we reverse the judgment.a retailer must remove architectural barriers to access where such removal is readily achievable and,if not readily achievable because of great difficulty or expense,must adopt alternative methods for making its merchandise available to disabled individuals by the provision of customer assistance or other means,b a iv,v.we find sufficient evidence to support the trial court finding that the removal of barriers to access is not readily achievable in this instance,and thus not legally mandated.however,we conclude that a retailer does not meet its obligation to make its merchandise available to disabled individuals denied access to the retailer existing stores by constructing new and geographically distant stores that are accessible.accordingly,we remand the case for consideration of appropriate alternative means for making merchandise available to disabled individuals who are denied physical access.
procedural background 
appellant californians for disability rights cdr is a nonprofit corporation organized to protect the interests of persons with disabilities.on may,cdr filed a lawsuit against respondent mervyn,llc mervyn,a corporation that operates retail department stores throughout the state of california cdr alleged that mervyn denied store access to persons with mobility disabilities by failing to provide adequate pathway space between merchandise displays for wheelchairs and other mobility aids.cdr pleaded a single cause of action for injunctive relief under california unfair competition law,which defines unfair competition to include any unlawful business act or practice.bus,et the ucl.cdr alleged that mervyn practice of denying access to disabled individuals was unlawful because it violated california unruh civil rights act,et and california disabled persons act,et.
the case proceeded to an bench trial that began in august.the trial court denied relief to cdr and entered judgment in favor of mervyn on february.the trial court found that to percent of mervyn merchandise is inaccessible to persons using mobility aids,but concluded that the removal of access barriers was not readily achievable,and thus not legally mandated,because full access would necessitate a significant loss of selling space and profit.the court also concluded that mervyn provided an alternative method for making its merchandise available to disabled individuals by designing its new and remodeled stores to be physically accessible.cdr appealed the judgment.
while this case was pending on appeal,the voters of california amended the statute under which the case had been prosecuted.the voters enactment,popularly known as proposition,was passed in the california general election on november,and went into effect the next day.cal,art.ii,subd.a.at the time this case was tried,the ucl authorized any person acting for the general public to sue for relief from unfair competition.californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d,mervyn.standing to bring such an action did not depend on a showing of injury or damage.ibid.proposition amended the ucl to limit private enforcement to those who have suffered injury in fact and have lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.ibid.proposition did not state whether this new limitation applies to pending cases.id.at,d.
on december,mervyn moved to dismiss this appeal upon the claim that proposition change in standing requirements apply to pending cases.we denied the motion because new legislative enactments are presumed to operate prospectively,rather than retroactively,to avoid unfair impairment of existing rights and obligations.in july,the california supreme court reversed our ruling,upon concluding that application of proposition standing requirements to pending cases would not constitute a retroactive application of the law because the initiative measure did not change any existing rights or obligations.mervyn,supra,cal th at,d.while the measure withdraws the standing of persons who have not been harmed to represent those who have,it did not impair any rights because lack of standing is a jurisdictional challenge that can be raised at any time in a legal proceeding.id.at,d.the high court reversed our denial of mervyn motion to dismiss the appeal and remanded the case to us for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.id.at,d.
on remand to this court,cdr asked leave to move for substitution of plaintiff on did not contend that it had standing to appeal in its own right as a party aggrieved by the judgment under code of civil procedure section.we denied cdr request and granted mervyn motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of standing by cdr.cdr petitioned for review in the supreme court.the supreme court granted review and transferred the case to us with directions to vacate our decision and to reconsider the cause in light of united investors life ins.waddell reed,th,d united investors and branick downey savings loan cal th,d,branick.
united investors held that a plaintiff has standing to appeal dismissal of a ucl complaint following demurrer even if it has no authority to maintain its suit in superior court,because plaintiff is sufficiently aggrieved by the dismissal of its complaint that it has standing to appeal under code of civil procedure section.united investors,supra,th at,d.branick held that proposition does not forbid amendment of complaints in the trial court to substitute new plaintiffs for those who have lost standing under the new measure.branick,supra,cal th at,d.the ordinary rules governing the amendment of complaints apply.id.at,d.
upon reconsideration,we denied mervyn motion to dismiss the appeal in a ruling we issued on april.we concluded that the two cases referenced by the high court,when read in conjunction,lead to the following conclusion cdr is a party aggrieved by entry of judgment against it and thus has standing to appeal the judgment even if cdr has no authority to maintain its suit in superior court united investors,supra,th at,d and,if cdr succeeds in its effort to reverse the judgment on appeal,it may seek leave in the superior court to amend its complaint to substitute a plaintiff who meets the proposition standing requirement.branick,supra,cal th at,d.mervyn petitioned for review in the supreme court,and the petition was denied on july.
the parties completed briefing on the merits of the appeal in january,and the matter was argued and submitted for decision.we now turn to the trial court factual findings following the bench trial,and then proceed to discuss cdr claims raised on appeal.
ii.the trial court factual findings 
at the time of trial,target corporation operated a total of stores nationwide,in three separate divisions target stores,mervyn,and marshall fields mervyn has retail department stores nationwide,of which are located in california.mervyn california stores range in size from to square feet.mervyn stores are designed to be customers are expected to maneuver independently through the store to the display units to examine and to select merchandise from display units,remove the merchandise,and then bring it to a sales counter to purchase.
mervyn stores generally have a single wide,aisle that runs from the stores entrances to the various departments.the stores have seven departments women clothing,men clothing,children clothing,lingerie,home,and shoes.each department consists of one or more carpeted pads in which the merchandise is placed on display units that include racks,shelves,and other structures to display merchandise.all display units are moveable they are not permanently affixed to a structure.every mervyn store uses hundreds of these moveable display units,which fill the stores selling space.the display units are arranged to create pathways within the merchandise selling pads.
persons using mobility aids,like wheelchairs,generally need a minimum of inches of clearance to traverse a pathway.the pathways between merchandise display units at mervyn do not all provide inches of clearance.mervyn does not impose,as a requirement,the maintenance of any minimum space in pathways created by moveable display units at any of its stores.mervyn does have corporate guidelines for the arrangement of display units,but these guidelines themselves call for only inches of clearance between horizontal merchandise pathways,which are those running parallel to the store back wall.mervyn guidelines do advise inches of clearance for vertical merchandise pathways,which are those running parallel to the main aisle from the entrance to the back wall of a department.mervyn guidelines also advise inches of clearance at the back wall of a department.but the guidelines are not a requirement,and are not universally implemented.between to percent of the vertical pathways at mervyn stores provide less than inches of clearance 
persons with mobility disabilities testified at trial that they were often unable to enter more than a few feet into departments.even when able to partially enter departments at mervyn,witnesses testified that narrowing pathways,and protruding merchandise have caused them at times to become stuck or stranded within merchandise pads.witnesses testified to racks in narrow aisles becoming caught or lodged in their mobility devices,sometimes causing racks to tip over and fall on top of them,or at other times,causing their mobility device to jolt forward or stop abruptly.several witnesses testified that protruding arms of tightly spaced merchandise racks have physically injured them.
mervyn has no policy prohibiting the placement of moveable display units that obstruct people with disabilities from using pathways across merchandise pads.nor has mervyn designated any specific individual with corporate responsibility for assuring access to merchandise for people with mobility disabilities.mervyn asserted at trial that it provides customer service to the extent it fails to provide actual physical access to merchandise for customers with disabilities.mervyn trains all of its employees on how to assist disabled customers.but mervyn does not designate any employees specifically to provide customer service to customers with disabilities in its stores.mervyn sales clerks are charged with assisting customers in locating merchandise,but the clerks primary responsibility is processing purchases at the sales counter.several disabled persons who testified at trial reported instances where they received assistance from mervyn employees when they sought help but the witnesses testified that they generally have difficulty getting the attention of sales clerks at mervyn stores,and are rarely able to get adequate customer assistance.several witnesses also testified that,because they are seated in their mobility aids and because the pathways are narrow and clogged,they often can not see the merchandise and therefore have difficulty telling an employee what items to bring them.mervyn vice president of stores admitted that having to ask a salesperson to bring items to a customer is not an adequate substitute for the customer being able to reach or look at the items himself or herself,unless the customer knows exactly what items he or she wants.
plaintiff presented an expert witness,jonathan adler,who offered proposals for rearranging the display units on mervyn sales floors in ways he believed would result in improved access adler is a consultant who advises government and private entities on compliance with disability laws.he testified that his consulting services include helping business owners survey their existing facilities and providing recommendations for how to correct access barriers.adler testified that mervyn could improve access by utilizing wasted floor space in some departments and by repositioning display units.
mervyn countered with the testimony of its director of store design,john calderon,who said that adler proposals would reduce selling space and were contrary to accepted retailing techniques for displaying merchandise.mervyn also presented the expert witness testimony of tyzoon tyebjee,a marketing professor.tyebjee conducted a field test of six mervyn stores that were respaced with a clearance for all vertical pathways between merchandise display units.respacing the test stores required removal of about four percent of display racks,on average.tyebjee concluded that respacing stores with vertical pathway clearance had an adverse impact on sales at mervyn.clay creasey,mervyn chief financial officer,quantified the lost profit for the six test stores over the course of the test at approximately million.creasey calculated that if the test spacing criteria were expanded to all california stores,the result would be approximately million in lost sales and million in lost profit annually.
iii.discussion 
cdr brings this case under california unfair competition law,which defines unfair competition to include any unlawful business act or practice.bus.by proscribing any unlawful business practice,section borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.cdr claims mervyn has unlawfully failed to provide disabled customers with full and equal access to its retail department stores,in violation of state law under california unruh civil rights act the unruh act,et and the disabled persons act the dpa,et,which incorporate protection standards of the federal americans with disabilities act ada,et.to determine if mervyn business practice is unlawful,we must first review an array of disability civil rights law.we then turn to a consideration of cdr claims on appeal.
overview of disability civil rights law 
federal law the ada 
congress enacted the ada in to remedy widespread discrimination against disabled individuals.in studying the need for such legislation,congress found that historically,society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,and,despite some improvements,such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.pga tour,martin,d.congress noted that the many forms such discrimination takes include outright intentional exclusion as well as the failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices.citation.after thoroughly investigating the problem,congress concluded that there was a compelling need for a clear and comprehensive national mandate to eliminate discrimination against disabled individuals,and to integrate them into the economic and social mainstream of american life.id.at.
in the ada,congress provided that broad mandate to effectuate its sweeping purpose,the ada forbids discrimination against disabled individuals in major areas of public life,among them employment title i of the act,public services title ii,and public accommodations title iii.pga tour,martin,supra,at,fns.omitted.we are concerned here with title iii of the ada that states a general rule of nondiscrimination in public accommodations no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns,leases or leases to,or operates a place of public accommodation.a.supplementing this general rule are specific prohibitions.b see spector norwegian cruise line,d explaining structure of ada title iii.among its specific prohibitions,title iii of the ada prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability both with respect to the accessibility of their physical facilities and with respect to their policies and practices.moeller taco bell corporation.
congress adopted two distinct standards for regulating building accessibility one to apply to facilities existing before january,and the other to apply to facilities newly constructed or altered on or after january.b a iv,a.a congressional committee remarked that the distinction between existing and new facilities,reflects the balance between the need to provide access for persons with disabilities and the desire to impose limited cost on businesses.because retrofitting existing structures to make them fully accessible is costly,a far lower standard of accessibility has been adopted for existing structures.iii.
under the ada,existing facilities must remove architectural barriers where such removal is readily achievable,meaning easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense,b a iv.if removal of architectural barriers from an existing facility is not readily achievable,the facility must make its goods and services available to disabled individuals through alternative methods if such methods are readily achievable.b a v.in contrast,new and altered facilities must be readily accessible and usable,and must comply with extensive and detailed regulations,amounting to a federal building code,known as the ada accessibility guidelines adaag.a,app.a.
as previously noted,the ada prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in places of public accommodation with respect to the accessibility of their physical facilities and with respect to their policies and practices.moeller taco bell corporation,supra,at.in the ada specific prohibitions section,discrimination is defined to include a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures,when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations to individuals with disabilities,unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations.b a ii.
the ada permits reliance on state laws that provide greater protection.b.in describing the ada relationship with other laws,the ada states nothing in this chapter shall be construed to invalidate or limit the remedies,rights,and procedures of any federal law or law of any state or political subdivision of any state or jurisdiction that provides greater or equal protection for the rights of individuals with disabilities than are afforded by this chapter ibid.
state law the unruh act and the dpa 
the unruh act and the dpa entitle disabled individuals to full and equal access to public accommodations,subd.b,subd.a.the unruh act provides broad civil rights protection all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,medical condition,marital status,or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever,subd.b.the dpa protects the civil rights of disabled individuals,and states individuals with disabilities shall be entitled to full and equal access,as other members of the general public,to places of public accommodation,amusement or resort,and other places to which the general public is invited,subd.a.
as the federal government does with the ada,california mandates specific requirements for building accessibility by statute,et health.all buildings constructed or altered after july,must comply with standards governing the physical accessibility of public accommodations.citation.from december,until the present,the standards have been set forth in title of the california regulatory code,tit.title.moeller taco bell corporation,supra,at,fns.omitted see people ex rel.deukmejian che,d.explaining evolution of state building standards.a violation of a title building standard that denies access to a disabled individual has been found to constitute a violation of both the unruh act and the dpa.hankins el torito restaurants,th,d dpa moeller taco bell corporation,supra,at unruh act and the dpa wilson pfs,llc d,questioning the extent to which the unruh act requires intentional discrimination.
a violation of the ada also constitutes a violation of both the unruh act and the dpa,subd.f,subd.c.after the ada was passed in,the california disabled persons act and the unruh civil rights act were amended to provide that a violation of the ada constitutes a violation of their provisions.citations.thus,a plaintiff whose rights are violated under the ada may now seek damages under the california statutes,and is not limited to injunctive relief as plaintiffs are under federal law.pickern best western timber cove lodge marina resort d.the expansion of california law to include ada violations had other effects.for example,title does not require facilities that predate its enactment to comply with its regulations unless and until the facility is altered.pickern,at,fn.in contrast,t he ada requires existing facilities to remove barriers to access so long as removal is readily achievable,regardless of whether the facility has been altered.ibid.by amending the civil code to provide that a violation of the ada is also a violation of the unruh act and the dpa,the legislature authorized the filing of civil actions under state law to enforce the federal requirement that architectural barriers be removed where it is readily achievable to do so,and that alternative means of access be provided where physical access is not readily achievable.
appellant cdr claims on appeal 
we do not reach cdr claim that state law provides access rights broader than ada standards 
the parties are agreed that a violation of the federal ada or state building standards in title constitutes a violation of the dpa.the parties disagree on whether a violation of the ada or a structural access standard under title are the only acts that can constitute a violation of the dpa where architectural barriers are at issue.here,the trial court found title inapplicable,because it is silent on the matter of moveable merchandise display units,and found no ada violation upon concluding that removal of the access barrier created by merchandise display units was not readily achievable.
the parties do not dispute the trial court finding that title is inapplicable the dispute lies with the court findings that the dpa full and equal access standard is coextensive with ada standards.cdr argues that the state dpa mandates full and equal access without qualification,and thus requires the removal of architectural barriers from existing facilities regardless of whether removal is readily achievable within the meaning of the ada.in response,mervyn says the dpa does not compel the removal of architectural barriers except as required by the ada or specific building code requirements under title.cdr challenge raises an interesting issue about the scope of state disability laws,and has attracted the attention of the california attorney general and several disability rights organizations,who have filed amicus curiae briefs in support of cdr position 
while the issue has attracted attention on appeal,it was never adequately presented in the trial court.cdr trial argument for dpa protection broader than ada standards was undeveloped.cdr vaguely insisted that the dpa guarantee of full and equal access imposed affirmative obligations,but cdr never clearly distinguished the state obligation from the federal ada obligation to remove access barriers.notably,cdr never addressed perhaps the most pertinent authority on the subject at the time of trial marsh edwards theatres circuit,d.marsh marsh,which predated the ada but postdated state building standards,held that the dpa does not impose an affirmative duty to eliminate access barriers except as required by specific building standards.id.at.marsh found that specific legislation mandating building standards governed alleged architectural barriers,not the dpa general guarantee of full and equal access.ibid.this district court of appeal has noted,in addressing a different aspect of the dpa,that marsh may establish a rule that a structural impediment to access does not violate the dpa unless the impediment also violates a structural access standard.hankins el torito restaurants,supra,th at,d see california department of justice,legal rights of persons with disabilities,the dpa alone does not require an establishment to make structural modifications.the fifth district court of appeal recently found that marsh does establish such a rule,and followed it.coronado cobblestone village community rentals,supra,th at,d.cdr never addressed marsh or the principles it espoused in the trial court,and continues to overlook marsh on appeal.points not raised in the trial court will not be considered on appeal.hepner franchise tax bd.th,d.
in any event,resolution of the dpa scope is unnecessary here.as discussed in detail below,we conclude that cdr proved a violation of ada accessibility standards,and thus a dpa violation.we need not,and thus do not,determine whether mervyn violated state statutes independent of the ada violation.
mervyn denial of physical access to merchandise must be evaluated under ada standards applicable to architectural barriers,not discriminatory policies 
the starting point of our ada analysis is the trial court factual finding,uncontested by mervyn on appeal,that between and percent of the vertical pathways between merchandise display units in mervyn department stores are inaccessible to disabled individuals using mobility aids.the stores at issue on appeal were constructed before,and thus are existing facilities within the meaning of the ada.a preliminary legal issue is whether the denial of access to merchandise is an architectural barrier b a iv,as mervyn contends,or a discriminatory policy b a ii,as cdr contends.the distinction is important because the two types of discrimination are evaluated differently under the ada.the trial court evaluated the case under both types of discrimination.we conclude that the case presents architectural barrier discrimination.
the ada defines discrimination to include,among other things a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures,when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations to individuals with disabilities,unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations b a ii and a failure to remove architectural barriers in existing facilities where such removal is readily achievable b a iv.
we acknowledge an initial hesitancy to regard moveable displays as an architectural barrier,as the term suggests permanent structures.however,courts presented with similar claims of narrow pathways through merchandise displays have used an architectural barrier analysis.colorado coalition too delaware,d,too,shimozono v.the may stores wl at,lieber macy west,supra,d at.the colorado district court articulated an extensive and persuasive explanation for why the arrangement of moveable displays in a retail clothing store is best evaluated as an architectural barrier.too,supra,at.the court first noted that the term architectural commonly refers to a building structural elements but found that legislative history compels a broader understanding of the term.ibid.as the court discerned,congress used the term to mean physical barriers and expressly mentioned moveable display racks as a type of physical barrier governed by section b a iv.too,at,citing.ii.
in discussing the reach of the ada section governing architectural barriers in existing facilities,a congressional committee said this section may require the removal of physical barriers,including those created by the arrangement o r location of such temporary or moveable structures as furniture,equipment,and display racks.for example,a restaurant may need to rearrange tables and chairs,or a department store may need to adjust its layout of display racks and shelves,in order to permit access to individuals who use wheelchairs,where these actions can be carried out without much difficulty or expense.ii.
regulations issued under the ada reflect the same,broad meaning of architectural barriers.the regulations provide that a public accommodation shall remove architectural barriers in existing facilities where such removal is readily achievable,and offer as an example r earranging tables,chairs,vending machines,display racks,and other furniture.a,b.united states department of justice doj publications are in accord.one publication states that retailers must provide a minimum width route between displays and shelves if readily achievable,which is the standard applicable to architectural barriers in existing facilities.doj small bus,ada guide for small business.another doj publication reiterates the regulatory requirement that display racks be rearranged to provide access,if readily achievable.americans with disabilities act,ada title iii technical assistance manual ada manual.that publication also broadly defines architectural barriers as physical elements of a facility that impede access by people with disabilities.these barriers include more than obvious impediments such as steps and curbs that prevent access by people who use wheelchairs.id.at.the doj states impediments caused by the location of temporary or movable structures,such as furniture,equipment,and display racks,are also considered architectural barriers.id.at,italics added.
we thus conclude that a physical arrangement of merchandise display racks that denies access to the disabled in stores constructed before should be evaluated as an architectural barrier under the ada.b a iv.we see no basis for treating mervyn physical arrangement of its merchandise as a policy subject to different evaluative standards.b a ii.the discriminatory policy provision of the ada has been applied to far different circumstances from those presented here,such as a golf tournament rule precluding use of golf carts that excluded a golfer with a circulatory disorder from competition pga tour,martin,supra,at.a restaurant policy of denying use of an employee restroom to a customer with a leg prosthesis and crutches who could not reach the public restroom up a flight of stairs hankins el torito restaurants,supra,th at,d and a brewery no animal policy that excluded a guide dog assisted blind man from a public tour johnson gambrinus brewery cir.
the alleged policy cdr challenges is mervyn policy or practice of maintaining narrow pathways that prevent or impede access to the merchandise at its stores.this is plainly a claim that mervyn is creating physical barriers that directly bar access to all disabled individuals,and is not a claim of an intangible policy that can be modified to accommodate particular individuals.a plaintiff can not be permitted to recharacterize architectural access barriers as a policy of maintaining access barriers without destroying the statutory framework that distinguishes between barriers and policies.where a plaintiff complains that specific physical features at a facility deny access,the complaint is best assessed under principles governing architectural barriers rather than policies.see macclymonds imi investments,wl at refusing use of policy paradigm where complaint alleged narrow walkway and other physical accessibility problems.accordingly,we conclude that mervyn physical arrangement of moveable display racks is best evaluated as an architectural barrier.
architectural barriers must be removed if removal is readily achievable 
discrimination under the ada includes a failure to remove architectural barriers in existing facilities where such removal is readily achievable.b a iv.moreover,where an entity can demonstrate that the removal of a barrier is not readily achievable,a failure to make such goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations available through alternative methods is discrimination,if such methods are readily achievable.b a v.
the term readily achievable means easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.in determining whether an action is readily achievable,factors to be considered include a the nature and cost of the action needed under this chapter b the overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the action the number of persons employed at such facility the effect on expenses and resources,or the impact otherwise of such action upon the operation of the facility c the overall financial resources of the covered entity the overall size of the business of a covered entity with respect to the number of its employees the number,type,and location of its facilities and d the type of operation or operations of the covered entity,including the composition,structure,and functions of the workforce of such entity the geographic separateness,administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity.
ada regulations provide additional guidance.the regulations list r earranging display racks,and other furniture among examples of specific steps to remove barriers.b.public accommodations are urged to take measures to comply with the barrier removal requirements in the order of certain priorities.c.the first priority is access to the facility from the street,and the next priority is access to those areas of a place of public accommodation where goods and services are made available to the public.these measures include,for example,adjusting the layout of display racks,and rearranging tables c.
however,the regulations further provide that t he rearrangement of temporary or movable structures,such as furniture,equipment,and display racks is not readily achievable to the extent that it results in a significant loss of selling or serving space.f.at least one court has held that the significant loss of selling space standard is only meaningful to the extent that it affects operations.lieber macy west,supra,d at.the ada statute makes clear that the readily achievable barrier removal obligation must consider the overall financial resources,effect on expenses and resources,and the effect on operations of the facilities involved in the action.ibid.in calculating the financial resources of a facility,the doj states that the resources of both the local facility and parent entity must be considered.ada manual.in practice,this has meant consideration of the financial resources of both the immediate corporate entity owner and its parent corporation.see guzman denny d,inaccessible rest room at a single denny restaurant court considered resources of denny and its parent corporation.
the defendant bears the ultimate burden of proving that removal of an architectural barrier is not readily achievable,as an affirmative defense.colorado cross disability coalition hermanson family.partnership i hermanson cir.every federal court that has considered the matter has put the initial burden on the plaintiff to introduce evidence tending to show that the proposed method of removal of an existing architectural barrier is readily achievable.macclymonds imi investments,supra,wl at collecting cases.if the plaintiff meets its burden of production,then the defendant must counter with evidence of its own and carries the ultimate burden of persuasion on its defense that removal is not readily achievable ibid.there is s ome variance among courts concerning how much evidence and what type of evidence is required for the plaintiff to meet his burden.id.at collecting cases.some courts have set the threshold low,massachusetts e trade access,d.the massachusetts court observed practically speaking,there may often be an information imbalance between a plaintiff and a defendant,with the defendant possessing the additional experience and knowledge gained from owning and operating the facility containing the architectural barrier.nevertheless,a plaintiff should at a minimum provide a general plan and discuss its feasibility,bearing in mind both structural concerns and estimated costs.ibid.other courts have set the threshold high,hermanson,supra,at requiring precise cost estimates and a specific design for a proposed wheel chair ramp.
cdr produced prima facie evidence that the removal of architectural barriers was readily achievable 
cdr presented an expert witness who testified at length about proposals to remove the architectural barriers created by mervyn arrangement of its merchandise display units.the trial court found that p laintiff has suggested various ways of removing barriers created by narrow pathways.these include rearranging fixtures on the floor,rearranging departments to use extra space from other departments,using more efficient fixtures,using space on the wide main aisle,using maps merchandise adjacency plans for laying out merchandise that are designed for particular stores and that include minimum pathway widths,measuring pathway widths on a systematic basis,and enforcing mervyn own spacing guidelines.nevertheless,the trial court deemed this evidence insufficient to meet cdr initial burden of producing evidence that removal of barriers was readily achievable.the trial court,in reliance upon the strict standard of hermanson,supra,at,faulted cdr proposals as entirely conceptual,unconnected to any cost estimates,and made without regard to merchandising or retail needs by a disability access expert unfamiliar with mervyn merchandise presentation plans.the court noted,for example,that plaintiff proposals for rotating tables away from the main aisle and removing rack extensions would reduce merchandise visibility,contrary to a basic retailing technique.cdr says that the court set the threshold for its prima facie case too high.we agree.
as the massachusetts district court noted practically speaking,there may often be an information imbalance between a plaintiff and a defendant,with the defendant possessing the additional experience and knowledge gained from owning and operating the facility containing the architectural barrier.massachusetts e trade access,supra,d at.such is the case here.in determining whether a plaintiff has introduced prima facie evidence tending to show that removal of an existing architectural barrier is readily achievable,a plaintiff should not be expected to address industry and operational concerns best known by the retailer.plaintiff made a specific proposal to remove the architectural barrier caused by narrow merchandise pathways by,among other things,rotating merchandise tables,contracting display racks,and removing display rack extensions.plaintiff should not be required to provide a plan so specific that it fully accommodates industry techniques for highlighting merchandise and mervyn specific presentation practices.
this case is unlike hermanson,supra,at,which was concerned with renovating a historical building,not rearranging display racks.in hermanson,the plaintiff presented a conceptual sketch for a wheelchair ramp into a historical building,with estimated probable costs based on similar projects.id.at.the court,remarking that it was a close case,found the evidence insufficient because plaintiff failed to present any evidence the city would approve modification to the historical building,failed to provide precise costs estimates,and p erhaps most importantly,failed to present a specific design.id.at.notably,there was no information imbalance massachusetts e trade access,supra,d at between the plaintiff and defendant in hermanson.a plaintiff may obtain specific plans and precise costs estimates for a structural renovation like installation of a wheelchair ramp without owning and operating the facility.but the plaintiff here could not estimate the cost of rearranging display racks without operational knowledge such as sales per square foot and the applicable profit margin.the readily achievable analysis must be done on a case by case basis.iii.in this case,we conclude that plaintiff produced sufficient evidence to satisfy its burden to show that its suggested method of barrier removal was readily achievable.
mervyn produced substantial evidence that removal of architectural barriers would result in a significant loss of sales,and thus removal is not readily achievable 
a failure to remove architectural barriers in existing facilities where such removal is readily achievable is discrimination under the ada.b a iv.the term readily achievable means easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.the rearrangement of temporary or movable structures,such as furniture,equipment,and display racks is not readily achievable to the extent that it results in a significant loss of selling or serving space.f.
the trial court found that cdr proposals to remove access barriers by fully implementing mervyn spacing guidelines or otherwise reconfiguring merchandise displays would necessitate a loss of selling space.the court found the loss of selling space significant upon crediting mervyn evidence that six stores lost million in profit in nine months when the stores adopted vertical pathways through merchandise displays.the court also accepted mervyn evidence that mervyn would suffer annual lost sales of million,and up to million in lost profits,if the same spacing guidelines were implemented in all california stores.the court concluded that the removal of access barriers with s uch a drastic result of lost sales and profit that would imperil mervyn operations is not,and can not be deemed,readily achievable.
cdr argues that the study was fundamentally flawed,and the extrapolation of the study results to all mervyn stores was wrongly admitted into evidence.even if the study and extrapolation were properly relied upon,argues cdr,the court erred in failing to consider mervyn total financial resources when assessing whether the removal of access barriers is readily achievable.more generally,cdr argues that the evidence is insufficient to support the trial court finding that respacing mervyn merchandise pathways to allow greater access is not readily achievable because respacing would result in a significant loss of selling space.
we review the trial court factual findings under the deferential substantial evidence standard.where findings of fact are challenged on a civil appeal,we are bound by the elementary,but often overlooked principle of law,that the power of an appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,to support the findings below.citation.we must therefore view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor in accordance with the standard of review so long adhered to by this court.bickel city of piedmont cal th,d.substantial evidence supports the trial court findings.
as noted earlier,mervyn presented the testimony of marketing professor tyebjee,who conducted a field test of six mervyn stores that were respaced with a clearance for all vertical pathways between merchandise display units.tyebjee did not determine the amount of selling space lost by respacing the test stores,but mervyn chief financial officer,clay creasey,testified that respacing the test stores required removal of about four percent of display racks,on average,or roughly to racks per store.creasey explained that the removal of display racks is the removal,or loss,of selling space.tyebjee concluded that respacing stores with vertical pathway clearance had an adverse impact on sales at mervyn,but he did not quantify the impact.creasey quantified the lost profit for the six test stores over the course of the test at approximately million.creasey calculated that if the test spacing criteria were expanded to all california stores,the result would be approximately million in lost sales and million lost profit annually.
cdr asserts that tyebjee study was conceptually and methodologically flawed in multiple respects.cdr argues that the test stores were not a representative sample,and that the study failed to state how many racks were removed,failed to evaluate a range of respacing options,and failed to consider if improved displays could compensate for lost selling space.the argument is unavailing.there is substantial evidence that the test stores were a representative sample.creasey was asked on is it your testimony that the six test stores are representative of all mervyn stores is that your testimony creasey replied unequivocally that correct,yes.while creasey acknowledged that each store differs in its competitive environment and its mix of merchandise,creasey was adamant that there are vastly more similarities than there are differences among the stores.likewise,any failure of tyebjee study to state the number of display racks removed for the test stores was addressed by creasey,who testified that on average the stores lost approximately percent of the racks that the store overall has,and that roughly to racks per store.on appeal,we do not read a single witness testimony in isolation but consider the record as a whole.dimartino city of orinda th,d.
cdr remaining complaints about tyebjee the study did not evaluate other respacing options or the possible compensating effect of improved merchandise nothing to undermine the evidentiary force of the study on appeal in showing an adverse impact on sales from respacing.the study is substantial evidence that respacing resulted in lost sales.cdr conflicting claim that lost sales can be minimized by respacing only a portion of the stores or improving merchandise displays was weighed,and rejected,at trial.on appeal,we must resolve all conflicting evidence in favor of the fact finder judgment.bickel city of piedmont,supra,cal th at,d.
cdr challenge to creasey testimony on lost profits is likewise unavailing.cdr argues that the trial court erred in relying on creasey testimony that mervyn lost profit of million from respacing the test stores,and would lose million annually if all california stores were respaced.cdr first argues that the testimony was admitted for a limited purpose to explain why mervyn did not implement spacing guidelines and not for the truth of whether mervyn suffered lost profits from respacing stores.cdr is wrong.
while creasey testimony on lost profits was initially introduced and admitted for a limited purpose,the evidence was subsequently admitted without limitation.when creasey was first questioned about lost sales,the court indicated that the witness could testify about management decisions taken in response to the tyebjee study but could not extrapolate lost profits from the study.the court said that if mervyn wished to expand creasey testimony beyond the effect of the study on management decisions,we have to have a discussion again.such a discussion shortly ensued.creasey began to testify about the amount of lost sales and profits,and cdr objected on lack of foundation,speculation,and introduction of an undisclosed expert witness.the court asked the parties attorneys if cdr had notice that creasey would testify about the study,and mervyn said that creasey had been deposed on the subject.deposition testimony was read in which creasey said that mervyn extrapolated lost sales from the tyebjee study.the court overruled cdr objection to creasey testimony,and admitted the evidence without stating any limitation.creasey testimony on lost sales was not admitted for a limited purpose.
nor did the trial court err in overruling cdr objections.cdr argues on appeal that creasey testimony was conclusory and without foundation because he did not explain how he arrived at his estimated million in lost profits for the test stores,nor how he got from that figure to his estimated annual,statewide loss of million in sales,nor how he got from that figure to the million in lost profits.underlining omitted.the record is to the contrary.the tyebjee study reported lost sales by store department.creasey testified that he totaled the department figures for a average weekly figure of in lost sales.creasey said he then applied a profit margin to the sales figure to calcul
