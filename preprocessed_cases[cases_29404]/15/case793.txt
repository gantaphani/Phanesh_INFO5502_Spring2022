in this case,we must decide whether steven levine is entitled to offer evidence in support of his claim that experian information solutions,experian,a consumer reporting agency,violated the fair credit reporting act fcra,et.on appeal,levine challenges the district court order,which granted experian motion to dismiss his complaint for failure to state a claim.levine complaint alleged that experian violated fcra when it provided his credit report to a former creditor with whom levine no longer had an open or active account.levine claims that experian did not make a reasonable effort to safeguard his confidential information and that it had reasonable grounds to believe that the request was for an impermissible purpose under the fcra,notwithstanding the fact that the former creditor stated the report was for account review.concluding that levine has made out a prima facie claim under,we reverse the district court order and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the rather brief factual background to this action is as follows structure,structure,is a clothing retailer that issued a store credit card account to levine.this account was operated through a financial affiliate of structure,world financial national network bank wfnnb.levine paid the account in full and closed it sometime in.the fact that the account was paid in full and voluntarily closed by levine was shown on his experian credit report.
in may and again in august,despite the fact that the structure account had been closed for several years,experian sold levine credit report to structure.structure had informed experian that it wanted the report for account review purposes.structure reported no changes in levine account to experian,and levine made no communications to experian or structure regarding the closed account.
on may,levine filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia against experian,structure,and wfnnb.on november,the district court granted experian motion to dismiss and structure and wfnnb motion to dismiss.in granting experian motion,the district court stated that fcra does not suggest that a credit report may only be permissibly obtained for account review during particular points in the parties relationship and further commented that experian had no duty to investigate a facially valid request for a consumer report.at.the court ultimately held that levine stand alone claim of emotional distress was too amorphous to support his demand for damages and that he had not alleged any objectively verifiable harm.id.at.the court also concluded that levine had not sought statutory damages.on december,levine filed a notice of appeal seeking a reversal of the district court order granting the motions to dismiss.while levine later settled his claims against structure and wfnnb,the appeal continued for his claim against experian.
ii.discussion 
after identifying the appropriate standard of review,we address whether levine has stated a claim under fcra in two parts.first,we consider if the pleadings resolve the question of whether experian violated its responsibilities under fcra.second,we consider whether levine has made out a prima facie claim under the provisions of fcra that allow for recovery,including the extent to which he is required to specify his damages.
standard of review 
we review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim.harper blockbuster entm t,cir.federal rule of civil procedure a provides that a complaint must include only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.when considering a motion to dismiss,the pleadings are construed broadly so that all facts pleaded therein are accepted as true,and all inferences are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.bryant avado brands,cir see also swierkiewicz sorema,d the liberal notice pleading of rule a is the starting point of a simplified pleading system,which was adopted to focus litigation on the merits of a claim.additionally,a motion to dismiss is only granted when the movant demonstrates beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.harper,at internal quotations omitted.
experian responsibilities under fcra 
according to levine complaint,at the time experian sold his credit report to structure,experian knew that levine account with structure had been voluntarily closed and paid in full for years levine could no longer use the account levine had not disputed any information on the account structure did not ask solely for information regarding its own trade line but instead requested the entire credit report and structure twice requested his credit report from experian within the span of about three months.
in addition,levine contends that at no time before or after the purchases did structure provide any corrections or otherwise indicate in any way that there was a problem with the account.according to levine,different procedures and codes are used when creditors request credit report information in order to make corrections to the account.he argues that discovery likely will show that the code used by structure was inconsistent with any permissible purpose and that there are obvious and insidious reasons for a former creditor to secure a full credit report,rather than a beneficent request to recheck the accuracy of a account.levine contends that former creditors,by obtaining credit reports under the pretense of account review,can avoid making offers of credit to consumers whose credit reports are weak and can avoid the promotional blocks that limit access to some consumers credit reports.see d requiring creditors who use credit reports to make a firm offer of credit to each of the targeted consumers id.e providing consumers the right to block the sale of their credit reports for promotional purposes in his complaint,levine variously alleges that experian,which receives a fee for each requested credit report,was either negligent or willfully complicit in this attempt to circumvent the requirements of fcra 
in determining the scope of experian responsibilities,we are mindful of the legislative findings stated in fcra.specifically,in a,congress made the following finding on the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting there is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness,impartiality,and a respect for the consumer right to privacy.section b goes on to state that consumer reporting agencies are required to adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs for consumer credit information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer,with regard to the confidentiality,accuracy,relevancy,and proper utilization of such information.
with these statements in mind,we turn to the specific dictates of fcra.in the exercise of their grave responsibilities,consumer reporting agencies are prohibited under fcra from furnishing the confidential information in a consumer report to any person if it has reasonable grounds for believing that the consumer report will not be used for a purpose listed in section of this title.id.a.moreover,every agency shall make a reasonable effort to verify the uses certified prior to furnishing such user a consumer report.id.experian would have us accept that,as a matter of law,its grave responsibility for safeguarding levine confidential information extends only so far as a former creditor facially valid request for a credit report,notwithstanding any reasonable grounds to believe that the request is instead made for an impermissible purpose.we reject this conclusion.
when structure requested levine credit report,it informed experian that the request was for account review purposes.while fcra permits creditors to acquire a customer credit report for account review purposes,the statute does not explicitly state whether this includes the review of accounts that have been paid in full and closed.see id.the statute contains overlapping language in two provisions section a a permits the sale of a credit report to a creditor who intends to
