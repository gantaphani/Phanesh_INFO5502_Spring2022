this case concerns the requisite notice and opportunity to assert a consumer privacy right which must accompany a precertification communication to members of a putative class as we shall discuss,the court must take reasonable steps to assure that the consumer receives actual notice of his or her right to grant or withhold consent of the release of personal information,and that consent for such release be by the consumer positive act,rather than by mere failure to respond.
patrick olmstead purchased a dvd player from pioneer electronics usa,pioneer.he claims it is defective.he brought suit against pioneer on his own behalf and on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased the same model of allegedly defective dvds.responding to a discovery request by olmstead,pioneer produced documents relating to complaints it received from consumers.olmstead seeks identifying information about these persons pioneer asserts their right of privacy under the amendment to the california constitution.cal,art.i,privacy amendment.
the trial court ordered pioneer to inform the approximately to complaining consumers,by letter,about the lawsuit,olmstead request for identifying information in order to contact them,their right to object to release of that information,and that failure to respond would be treated as consent to release of the information.
pioneer seeks our intervention to compel the superior court to vacate that order.it does so on two grounds that the order is in excess of the court jurisdiction under code of civil procedure section and no disclosure of the identifying information should be made without the affirmative consent of the consumer.
the trial court order was preceded by an earlier order under which the identifying information would be released only if the consumer checked a box indicating consent.we conclude,first,that the trial court had authority to reconsider and modify this order,notwithstanding the requirements of section.on the merits,we conclude that an individual name and other identifying information are matters embraced within the privacy amendment,that adequate steps to assure actual notice is a prerequisite to an assumed waiver of the consumer right of privacy cal,art.i,and that the measures taken in this case are inadequate.
waiver may be express or implied.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.generally,an implied waiver based on failure to assert a right,including a constitutional right,must be accompanied by an informed intent to relinquish that right.id.at,d,north carolina butler,d waiver implied where no invocation of right to counsel people riva th,d waiver implied where defendant,who was not tricked or coerced,understood his rights but chose to speak with police.
although not couched in terms of waiver,that is what the trial court essentially meant when it decided that the consumer failure to respond to pioneer letter would be treated as consent to disclosure and contact by olmstead counsel.waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right the foundation of waiver is intent.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.a consumer can not be deemed to have intended to waive his or her right of privacy unless and until the consumer has notice of the need and opportunity to assert it.here,the challenged order does not adequately assure that the consumer will receive actual notice.absent notice,the consumer is unaware of the need to assert his or her privacy interest and is thereby deprived of a meaningful opportunity to do so.absent an affirmative response from the consumer,there is no adequate basis to infer that the consumer has consented to the release of personal information.
we shall order,on remand,that the trial court fashion an order that provides reasonable assurance that the consumers receive actual notice of the right to grant or withhold consent to release of personal information,and that such information not be released as to any consumer unless that consumer affirmatively agrees to such release.
factual and procedural summary 
olmstead filed a motion to compel pioneer to provide unredacted copies of consumer complaints it had received about the allegedly defective dvds.the motion sought to require pioneer to disclose the names and contact information of the complainants.
at a march,hearing,the court stated that the names are probably protected unless there a colonial life letter that goes out.the reference was to colonial life accident ins.superior court cal d,disclosure of names and addresses of third parties in bad faith insurance action proper only if those parties specifically authorized release by signing and dating an enclosed form that so stated.the clerk minute for that proceeding reflects that the court ordered pioneer to write a colonial pen letter and then reveal the names of those consumers who do not object.the court decision was refined in an order issued later that month.in it,the court stated that it is in receipt of two versions of a colonial life letter to customers and that t he major difference is whether or not an affirmative response should be required.in order for the letter to have any meaning,it should require an affirmative response,as did the letter in the colonial life case.
the court then authorized the following text 
dear consumer 
in august,litigation was filed in california in which the plaintiff alleges that pioneer dvd players are not compatible with the dvd video standard and as such,are incapable of playing all dvd discs.as part of the litigation,pioneer was required to provide the plaintiff counsel with a copy of the record that it made of information or complaints you provided some time ago when you contacted pioneer customer service department about your pioneer dvd player.before doing so,however,pioneer removed all identifying information regarding your name,address and telephone number.the court has now directed that pioneer send you this notice so that you can decide whether to authorize pioneer to disclose your personal information to the plaintiff counsel so they may contact you.
if you agree to the disclosure of this information to the plaintiff counsel,please check the box on the enclosed form and return it to the address shown on the form.not responding to this letter will be treated as declining contact from plaintiff counsel.italics added.
olmstead moved for reconsideration and clarification of this order.in april,the court granted his motion,vacated its march order,and adopted olmstead new proposed language for the letter on pages of the motion.
this new letter differs from the old in three material respects in the third sentence,it substituted your name,address,telephone number,fax number and address in place of your name,address,and telephone number in the fourth sentence,it substituted the same language in place of personal information and in the final paragraph it added do not before agree and substituted agreeing to in place of declining and by in place of from.the effect of these changes was to state that identifying information for the purpose of contact would be released unless the addressed consumer objected to the release.
later that month,the court stayed its april order pending writ review by this court.we issued an alternative writ.we now grant the petition for writ of mandate.
discussion 
pioneer contends the superior court was without jurisdiction to enter its april,order because olmstead motion for reconsideration and clarification failed to comply with the requirements of section courts of appeal are divided on the application of that statute to preclude reconsideration beyond the limited scope it provides.
some courts of appeal have stated that the power to correct judicial error in interim orders before judgment is an inherent judicial power derived from the california constitution,and therefore this power can not be impaired by statute.see,fischer first internat.bank th,d scott united states fidelity guaranty ins.th,d kerns cse ins.group th,d wozniak lucutz th,d blake ecker th,fn.d people castello th,d.other courts of appeal have held that statutory restrictions on a court power to reconsider its interim rulings,such as the restrictions found in section,are valid and constitutional.see,baldwin home savings of america th,d.people delouize cal th,fn,d,noting but not deciding which line of cases is correct.
we agree with the cases that hold trial courts retain inherent judicial power to reconsider rulings such as the march order in this case.thus,we conclude the superior court did not act in excess of its jurisdiction in doing so.we proceed to the merits.
olmstead contends that consumers who contacted pioneer have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the contact information they freely offered to pioneer,a consumer electronics so that they could be contacted regarding their complaint in the future,or,if they do,only minimal privacy interests are implicated.we do not agree.
under the privacy amendment to the california constitution,the definition of the right of privacy is simply the right to be left alone.ballot,proposed stats.and amends.to cal.const.with arguments to voters,argument in favor of,olmstead united states,dis.opn.of brandeis,calling the right of privacy the right to be let alone warren brandeis,the right to privacy harv,to similar effect.hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d,fn.omitted.
t he right to be left alone is a fundamental and compelling interest.it protects our homes,our families,our thoughts,our emotions,our expressions,our personalities,our freedom of communion,and our freedom to associate with the people we choose.it prevents government and business interests from collecting and stockpiling unnecessary information about us and from misusing information gathered for one purpose in order to serve other purposes or to embarrass us.ballot,supra,text of proposed stats.amends.to cal.
fundamental to our privacy is the ability to control circulation of personal information.this is essential to social relationships and personal freedom.the proliferation of government and business records over which we have no control limits our ability to control our personal lives.often we do not know that these records even exist and we are certainly unable to determine who has access to them.ballot,supra,text of proposed stats.amends.to cal.
this right to privacy is an important american heritage and essential to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the first,third,fourth,fifth and ninth amendments to the constitution.it should be abridged only when there is compelling public need.ballot,supra,text of proposed stats.amends.to cal.
the right to privacy also is reflected in other enactments.thus,the information practices act of,et includes express findings that a the right to privacy is being threatened by the indiscriminate collection,maintenance,and dissemination of personal information and the lack of effective laws and legal remedies b the increasing use of computers and other sophisticated information technology has greatly magnified the potential risk to individual privacy that can occur from the maintenance of personal information and c in order to protect the privacy of individuals,it is necessary that the maintenance and dissemination of personal information be subject to strict limits.
the right of privacy protects the individual reasonable expectation of privacy.whether a legally recognized privacy interest exists is a question of law for the court to decide.whether the circumstances give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy is a mixed question of law and fact for the court to decide.hill national collegiate athletic,supra,cal th at,d.
in a case concerning the right of householders not to receive advertising and solicitations by mail,the united states supreme court reiterated t he ancient concept that a man home is his castle into which not even the king may enter has lost none of its vitality.rowan post office,d.that court has traditionally respected the right of a householder to bar,by order or notice,solicitors,hawkers,and peddlers from his property.ibid.it held that a householder may circumscribe the right of a mailer to communicate with him by an affirmative act of giving notice that he wishes no further mailings from that mailer.see also.receipt of commercial mail solicitations impingement of strong privacy interest not to be disturbed in citizen home planned parenthood golden gate superior court th,d disclosure of names,addresses,and telephone numbers for contact implicates privacy interest in sanctity of home.
to do less would tend to license a form of trespass and would make hardly more sense than to say that a radio or television viewer may not twist the dial to cut off an offensive or boring communication and thus bar its entering his home.nothing in the constitution compels us to listen to or view any unwanted communication,whatever its merit.rowan post office,supra,at.
a person right of privacy as to his or her home includes the right to allow or prevent disclosure of the address of that home for the purpose of contact by mail.it also extends to disclosure of his or her unlisted telephone number to a stranger.similarly,the individual may choose to limit the privacy intrusion by restricting not just the kind of contact permitted but also the potential number of contacts.disclosure of the consumer name,address,telephone number,fax number,and address implicates this privacy interest.
contrary to olmstead argument,the consumers in this case can not be deemed to have given up privacy interests in their identifying information to others merely by contacting pioneer about allegedly defective dvd players.
case law is clear that w aiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right after knowledge of the facts.citations.the burden is on the party claiming a waiver of a right to prove it by clear and convincing evidence that does not leave the matter to speculation,and doubtful cases will be decided against a waiver citation.city of ukiah fones cal d,hills,chopstix dim sum cafe takeout iii,th,d waiver always rests upon intent.citations.the waiver may be either express,based on the words of the waiving party,or implied,based on conduct indicating an intent to relinquish the right.brookview condominium owners heltzer d.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th,d.
insofar as the record shows,the consumers who disclosed identifying information to pioneer did so in order to communicate with that company about what they perceived as a defective product.absent evidence to the contrary,and none is suggested,this was a specific and limited communication.it can not be construed as a wholesale consent that pioneer or anyone disseminate the information to third parties who seek it in order to contact consumers about litigation.
pioneer,as custodian of the relevant documents,has standing to assert the privacy interests of its customers in the identifying information.see valley bank of nevada superior court cal d.we turn to the manner in which these privacy interests must be asserted.the touchstone is notice and opportunity to consent or object to release of the information.
supreme court decisions describe two ways in which this may be accomplished.one places the burden on the privacy holder to object,seek a protective order,or initiate other legal proceedings to protect his or her interest.valley bank of nevada superior court,supra,cal d,valley bank.the other places the burden on the discovery proponent to obtain the signed written authorization of the privacy holder.colonial life accident ins.superior court,supra,cal d,colonial life.no authority has been cited to us that describes other possible alternatives,but that is not to say none exists.
as we shall discuss,neither valley bank nor colonial life involved the privacy interests of an individual in his or her name and identifying information and to be free from contact by others.the valley bank approach,which requires the consumer to affirmatively object to impingement of these privacy interests,makes perfect sense in the limited circumstances of that case,which involved a small number of persons whose identities already were known to the parties.it is inadequate when applied to a mass mailing to persons whose identities are not known by the party seeking discovery.the proposed ma
