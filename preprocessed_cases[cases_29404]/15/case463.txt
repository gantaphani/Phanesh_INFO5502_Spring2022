in the federal trade commission ftc initiated an action for injunctive and other equitable relief against several florida corporations and their officers and directors.see a b giving ftc power to bring suit in district court and seek preliminary injunction,authorizing ftc to bring suit and seek equitable relief telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act.the ftc alleged that the following interrelated corporations,run by peter porcelli,bonnie harris,and christopher tomasulo,engaged in deceptive trade practices in violation of section a of the federal trade commission act ftc act,a,and the telemarketing sales rule tsr,bay area business council,babc bay area business council customer service babc customer service american leisure card american leisure bay memberships,bay vacations,and.marketing consultants.in particular,the ftc alleged that the defendants misled consumers into believing that they would receive a credit card in exchange for a hefty fee.the district court granted the ftc motion for summary judgment against all of the corporate defendants and porcelli and harris.the defendants appeal,and we affirm.
the ftc based its action on an alleged telemarketing scheme run primarily out of largo,florida.managing babc and later american leisure,porcelli contracted with a telemarketing company in utah to call consumers throughout the united states who had recently applied for and been denied consumer credit.referring to those credit applications,telemarketers opened by saying,our records indicate that within the past months,you filed an application for a credit card and you are now eligible to receive your mastercard.after answering a few short verification questions,consumers were told that they were guaranteed to receive a mastercard that does not require a security deposit with an initial pay as you go limit of.
in addition to the mastercard,consumers were promised a fabulous florida vacation and a free trial babc membership.these offers,however,did not figure prominently in the script,which focused on the mastercard.the card was offered as a way to boost flagging credit ratings,as demonstrated by the following scripted promise n othing customer name looks better on your equifax credit report than a mastercard.
this supposed opportunity,however,came at a cost.telemarketers explained that like most cards there is a one time processing fee of plus shipping and handling,which covers the cost of processing the mastercard order and getting the vacation package delivered to you on a priority basis.in order to pay the fee,consumers were required to provide personal account information.after obtaining an account number and securing agreement from the consumer,telemarketers played an automated disclosure concluding with,you agree to everything we spoke about over the phone today,correct within days of the call,babc and american leisure debited customer accounts for anywhere from including shipping and handling to.
some time later,customers received the mastercard and accompanying package from babc or american leisure.instead of a credit card,the package contained an acceptance form for a chexcard tm mastercard.the card stated bay area business council prominently across the top and contained a copy of the mastercard logo in the lower corner.the back contained a meaningless black stripe in place of the customary magnetic strip on credit and debit cards.the explanatory material revealed that the card was a stored value card that the customer could receive only after mailing in a activation fee.after the actual card arrived four to six weeks later,it could only be used if a customer his or her own funds onto it.
in addition to the inoperable chexcard,customers received information on redeeming their free vacation a time share presentation and on their babc membership.the membership supposedly entitled consumers to take advantage of numerous free goods and services,such as gasoline,nationwide long distance,internet access,voice mail,and film developing.although this was not mentioned in the materials,the privilege of babc membership cost the consumer a month.the only notice of the fee was contained in the automated disclosure played in the initial sales call,where it was revealed that the would be taken directly from the consumer account each month.
not surprisingly,babc received a host of complaints from customers who thought they had been going to receive a credit card.incorporated separately but doing business under the name bay area business council,babc customer service handled customer complaints and requests for refunds.special technologies,essentially succeeded babc customer service in july.both operated from a suite in largo next to the offices of porcelli and harris.that suite received all calls placed to the toll free numbers for babc,american leisure.marketing consultants,and bay memberships.in addition to calls from disgruntled consumers,corporate records reveal that between november and july,babc received over written consumer complaints forwarded from the better business bureau,state attorney generals offices,and private lawyers.
the remaining corporate defendants also worked in conjunction with babc.like babc customer service.marketing consultants,did business under babc name.marketing consultants,however,had only four employees,three of whom were related to porcelli.they operated from porcelli home in dunedin,florida.marketing consultants charged babc and american leisure for the chexcards,and then,through a series of transactions,gave the proceeds to harris,who handled most of babc finances.at the end of july,porcelli created bay memberships,as a way to ensure that banks,which had begun refusing to process payments to babc and american leisure,would continue to charge customers.in the three weeks that bay memberships,operated,it processed approximately in debits from customer accounts.although it is not entirely clear from the record,bay vacations,was apparently another shell corporation doing business for babc.
in august,the ftc filed its action alleging that babc,babc customer service,american leisure,porcelli,tomasulo,and harris violated section a of the ftc act,a,and multiple provisions of the tsr by engaging in deceptive trade practices.the ftc later amended its complaint to name bay memberships,bay vacations,and.marketing consultants,as defendants collectively the corporate defendants.the ftc also secured an ex parte temporary restraining order with an accompanying freeze on the defendants assets.on august,a temporary receiver,accompanied by ftc employees,entered the corporate defendants premises in largo,florida to seize business records and shut down operations pursuant to the restraining order.
after conducting extensive discovery,the ftc moved for summary judgment against the corporate defendants,porcelli,and harris with its motion the ftc filed the required northern district of illinois local rule a statement of undisputed material facts.in response to the ftc motion,the defendants filed a document averring that an attached affidavit sworn by porcelli contested the vast majority of all facts listed as undisputed by the ftc.the defendants also submitted affidavits from three former babc employees and one former babc customer service employee.the affidavits made the following three assertions that most babc consumers who called asked about their vacation package,not about a credit card,that babc had a consumer refund policy,and that porcelli was in canada from may until shortly after babc was shut down by the ftc in august.the district court concluded that the defendants response failed to comply with local rule.it thus accepted as true all the facts in the ftc rule statement.
on that record,the court granted the ftc motion for summary judgment.the court concluded that the undisputed facts established that the defendants had violated section of the ftc act by misleading reasonable consumers into believing they would receive a credit card.see a forbidding deceptive practices affecting commerce.this deception,the court concluded,also violated a iii prohibiting misrepresentations about any material aspect of a sales offer and a forbidding misleading statements to induce payment for goods.and the court determined that the defendants violated a i by failing to tell consumers about the extra fee required to obtain the chexcard,id.requiring clear and conspicuous disclosure of all costs associated with goods offered for sale.finally,the district court concluded that porcelli and harris were individually liable for the corporate defendants deceptive practices because both had authority to control the corporate defendants and knew about their deceptive practices.the court then entered an order permanently enjoining the defendants from telemarketing,promoting or selling products,making misleading statements to consumers,failing to comply with the tsr,or disclosing any information about customers except to the ftc.the court also held the corporate defendants,harris,and porcelli jointly and severally liable for million in consumer redress.see b giving court jurisdiction to authorize consumer redress for a corporation deceptive trade practices.
the defendants primary argument on appeal concerns the district court enforcement of northern district of illinois local rule.that rule requires parties moving for summary judgment to submit with their motion a statement of material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue and that entitle the moving party to a judgment as a matter of law.a.the statement must be organized by numbered paragraphs and refer to the affidavits,parts of the record,and other supporting materials that substantiate the listed facts.the party opposing summary judgment must then submit a response to each numbered paragraph,including,in the case of any disagreement,specific references to the affidavits,parts of the record,and other supporting materials relied upon.id.b a.the reply must also contain numbered paragraphs with any additional facts that require the denial of summary judgment,supported by citations to the record.id.b b.finally,the rule provides that a ll material facts set forth in the statement required of the moving party will be deemed to be admitted unless controverted by the statement of the opposing party.
concluding that the defendants affidavits did not comply with the strictures of the rule,the district court disregarded them.the defendants,however,maintain that the district court should have considered porcelli page affidavit,which they believe complied with rule.they characterize the statements in porcelli affidavit as admissible evidence and insist that he responded to the undisputed facts listed by the ftc.we review the district court enforcement of the local rules for an abuse of discretion,ammons aramark uniform,cir.because of the important function local rules like rule serve in organizing the evidence and identifying disputed facts,we have consistently upheld the district court discretion to require strict compliance with those rules.see koszola bd.of,cir ammons,at bordelon chi.school reform bd.of trustees,cir waldridge am.hoechst,cir collecting cases.
we are to see how porcelli affidavit could constitute compliance with rule.the defendants insist that porcelli affidavit specifically addressed in corresponding paragraph numbers the facts in the ftc rule statement.this is untrue.by way of example,the eighth paragraph in the ftc rule statement asserts that american leisure did business as first american leisure card or american leisure card.in the corresponding paragraph of his affidavit,porcelli claims to deny,to his knowledge that sales representatives led consumers to believe that they would receive credit cards for an advance fee.and paragraph twelve of the ftc rule statement says that babc and american leisure entered into contracts with a company in george,utah to telemarket for them.paragraph twelve of porcelli affidavit,however,makes the unrelated claim that babc and american leisure telemarketing scripts included language regarding a vacation package.as demonstrated by the preceding examples,porcelli affidavit in no way constitutes a concise response to each numbered paragraph in the ftc statement.indeed,many portions bear no relationship at all to the facts set forth by the ftc.
moreover,with the exception of a sole reference to the defendants answer to the ftc amended complaint,porcelli affidavit fails to cite a single piece of record evidence to support its assertions.see bradley work,cir act of specifically correlating evidence in the record to factual propositions is key to system prescribed by local rules such as.in short,porcelli affidavit utterly fails to conform with the requirements of rule,and the district court had no obligation to construe it as compliant.we have noted before that rules like provide the only acceptable means of disputing the other party facts and of presenting additional facts to the district court.midwest imports,coval,cir.instead of employing those means,the defendants chose to submit porcelli affidavit and the affidavits of four of his former employees.having reviewed the affidavits,we concur in the district court judgment that they consist of unsupported and irrelevant conclusions.the court was thus well within its discretion to reject the defendants submissions.see ammons,at no abuse of discretion for court to strike responses that simply denied an allegation and provided no citation whatsoever bordelon,at upholding district court decision to strike statement full of argument,evasion,and improper denials.
we also reject the defendants related argument that the district court overlooked evidence giving rise to disputed issues of material fact.to uncover this evidence,the defendants suggest the district court should have harked back to affidavits submitted with their answer to the ftc amended complaint and their motion in opposition to the preliminary injunction.but local rules such as exist precisely because the district court is not obliged to scour the record looking for factual disputes.waldridge,at.moreover,the affidavits are unhelpful because many of the statements in them were subsequently discredited by deposition testimony and other evidence uncovered in discovery.see,ineichen ameritech,cir reiterating rule that a party may not create an issue of fact with an affidavit containing conclusions that contradict depositions or other sworn testimony balderston fairbanks morse engine div.of coltec,cir same.
accordingly,in our de novo review of the court grant of summary judgment,we consider only those facts in the ftc rule statement,which is amply supported by citations to the relevant record evidence.although we accept as true the facts in the ftc rule statement,we still view them in the light most favorable to the defendants in determining whether there exist disputed issues of material fact.see.c anderson liberty lobby,d laborers pension fund res env t,cir.although the defendants aver generally that there are disputed issues of fact that make summary judgment improper,nothing they point to undercuts the ftc undisputed evidence that they engaged in unfair trade practices,see a,and violated multiple provisions of the tsr,see.
section of the ftc act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.a.the ftc is empowered to initiate federal court actions to enforce violations of section and seek appropriate equitable relief.id.a b.the ftc may establish corporate liability under section with evidence that a corporation made material representations likely to mislead a reasonable consumer.see ftc tashman,cir ftc world travel vacation brokers,cir.the ftc is not,however,required to prove intent to deceive.ftc freecom communications,cir ftc amy travel,cir world travel,at.additionally,the omission of a material fact,without an affirmative misrepresentation,may give rise to an ftc act violation.amy travel,at world travel,at.the corporate defendants do not dispute the district court conclusion that they operated as a common enterprise such that they are jointly and severally liable for the injuries caused by their violations of the ftc act and the tsr.we thus consider them collectively when analyzing corporate liability.
