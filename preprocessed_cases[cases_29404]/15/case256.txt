opinion of the court 
the pennsylvania psychiatric society sued several managed health care organizations on behalf of its member psychiatrists and their patients.the gravamen of its complaint was that the managed health care organizations impaired the quality of health care provided by psychiatrists to their patients by refusing to authorize necessary psychiatric treatment,excessively burdening the reimbursement process and impeding other vital care.
the principal issue on appeal is whether the pennsylvania psychiatric society has properly pleaded associational and standing.finding the society would require significant individual participation to establish its member psychiatrists claims,the district court dismissed its complaint for lack of associational standing the district court also found the society member psychiatrists lacked standing to pursue their patients claims.as an alternative ground for dismissal,the district court held the mandatory arbitration provision in the psychiatrists contracts barred the society from advancing their members claims in court.
we believe the district court dismissal under.b was premature.for this reason,we will vacate and remand for further proceedings.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under because certain claims asserted by the pennsylvania psychiatric society arose under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,we have jurisdiction under.
the pennsylvania psychiatric society,a nonprofit corporation representing licensed psychiatrists in pennsylvania,filed suit on behalf of its member psychiatrists and their patients who subscribe to managed health care plans administered by green spring health services.
there are several defendants.green spring health services,provides a network of psychiatrists as well as administrative services for managed health care plans magellan health services,is its corporate parent.keystone health plan west,keystone health plan central,and keystone health plan east,are health maintenance organizations that contract with green spring health services to provide mental health and substance abuse services to their subscribers.highmark,is the parent company of keystone health plan west these managed care organizations collectively are referred to as the mcos.green spring health services,magellan health services and highmark choose which psychiatrists to credential to provide these services.
green spring health services administers the psychiatric and substance abuse services for the employee benefit plans provided by the health management organizations.for this purpose,it enters into contracts with psychiatrists the provider agreement to form a provider network to service the plans.in particular,the provider agreement assures that green spring health services will not undermine the psychiatrists responsibility to provide patients with the mental health services they require.for most disputes arising between credentialed psychiatrists and green spring health services,the provider agreement also contains a mandatory arbitration clause that requires exhaustion of internal review procedures before seeking binding arbitration.
alleging the mcos unfairly profit at the expense of the psychiatrists and their patients,the pennsylvania psychiatric society asserts several tort and breach of contract claims for impeding necessary psychiatric treatment.the pennsylvania psychiatric society contends the mcos refused to authorize and provide reimbursement for medically necessary mental health treatment interfered with patients care by permitting to make psychiatric treatment decisions violated provider agreements by improperly terminating relationships with certain psychiatrists and breached the contractual duties of good faith and fair dealing by failing to timely pay psychiatrists and by referring patients to inconvenient treatment locations,thereby depriving some patients access to treatment.
on the basis of these allegations,the pennsylvania psychiatric society claims the mcos tortiously interfered with the psychiatrists livelihood as well as the relationship.in addition,the society asserts the mcos fraudulently misrepresented the quality of care their plans would provide to subscribers and the benefits psychiatrists would receive for providing their services.finally,on behalf of its members patients,the society alleges the mcos made false representations to their subscribers in violation of the pennsylvania unfair trade practices and consumer protection law.const.stat.ann.et west.
the complaint sought declaratory relief,injunctive relief,and damages.the pennsylvania psychiatric society does not appeal the dismissal of its damages claims.
the suit commenced in state court but was removed to federal court on grounds that erisa preempted all or,at least,some of the society claims.recommending dismissal,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation finding the society lacked standing to assert the claims of its members and their patients.as an alternative ground for dismissal,the magistrate judge found the mandatory arbitration clause in the psychiatrists contracts foreclosed advancing the claims in court.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report.the pennsylvania psychiatric society timely appealed.
the pennsylvania psychiatric society ability to press the claims of its members and their patients initially hinges on whether it meets the constitutional requirements for associational standing.for its part,the society seeks only to pursue claims on behalf of its members and their patients it does not allege direct injury to itself.
our review of a dismissal under.b for lack of standing is plenary.township of wall,cir instrument elecs,cir.on appeal,we must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to plaintiff.maio aetna,cir.the issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.in re burlington coat factory sec,cir quoting scheuer rhodes,d.therefore,we may affirm the district court only if we believe that the association would be entitled to no relief under any set of facts consistent with its allegations.allegheny hosp.philip morris,cir city of pittsburgh west penn power,cir.
to satisfy the case or controversy standing requirement under article iii,of the united states constitution,a plaintiff must establish that it has suffered a cognizable injury that is causally related to the alleged conduct of the defendant and is redressable by judicial action.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d discussing lujan defenders of wildlife,d the pitt news fisher,cir.associations may satisfy these elements by asserting claims that arise from injuries they directly sustain.see,babbitt united farm workers union,d.absent injury to itself,an association may pursue claims solely as a representative of its members.see,new york state club ass n,city of new york,d pub.interest research group of,magnesium elektron,cir.by permitting associational standing,we recognize that the primary reason people join an organization is often to create an effective vehicle for vindicating interests that they share with others.int l union,united,aerospace agric.implement workers brock,d see also joint refugee comm.mcgrath.jackson,concurring noting purpose of joining an association often is to permit the association to vindicate the interests of all.
the supreme court has enunciated a test for associational standing.an association must demonstrate that a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d permitting state agency that represented apple industry to challenge north carolina statute see also laidlaw envtl,at.hosp.council city of pittsburgh,cir.the need for some individual participation,however,does not necessarily bar associational standing under this third criterion.hospital council,at.
in this case,the mcos concede the pennsylvania psychiatric society satisfies hunt first and second prongs.but echoing defendants objections,the district court found the psychiatrists claims would require a level of individual participation that precludes associational standing.as noted,the society has not appealed the dismissal of its damages claims.this is noteworthy because damages claims usually require significant individual participation,which fatally undercuts a request for associational standing.on this point,the supreme court has explained that 
w hether an association has standing to invoke the court remedial powers on behalf of its members depends in substantial measure on the nature of the relief sought.if in a proper case the association seeks a declaration,injunction,or some other form of prospective relief,it can reasonably be supposed that the remedy,if granted,will inure to the benefit of those members of the association actually injured.indeed,in all cases in which we have expressly recognized standing in associations to represent their members,the relief sought has been of this kind.

the sole associational standing question remains whether,taking the allegations as true,the pennsylvania psychiatric society requests for declaratory and injunctive relief will require an inappropriate level of individual participation we first addressed this question in hospital council of western pennsylvania city of pittsburgh,where an association alleged that certain city and counties threatened to discriminate against nonprofit hospitals on taxation,zoning,and contract matters if the hospitals refused to make voluntary payments in lieu of taxes.interpreting hunt third prong through the prism of earlier supreme court jurisprudence,we rejected the city argument that some individual participation violated this requirement id.at.explaining the circumstances on which this conclusion rested,we concluded 
t he claims asserted by the council would require some participation by some council members.this case,unlike many prior associational standing cases,does not involve a challenge to a statute,regulation,or ordinance,but instead involves a challenge to alleged practices that would probably have to be proved by evidence regarding the manner in which the defendants treated individual member hospitals.adjudication of such claims would likely require that member hospitals provide discovery,and trial testimony by officers and employees of member hospitals might be needed as well.nevertheless,since participation by each allegedly injured party would not be necessary,we see no ground for denying associational standing.
the court of appeals for the seventh circuit subsequently adopted our interpretation of hunt third prong in retired chicago police association city of chicago,where the retired chicago police association sued the city to bar implementation of increased health care premiums.cir.in this litigation,the retired chicago police association represented city employees who allegedly had been guaranteed subsidized health coverage.when the city attempted to raise the coverage price because of escalating costs,the employees claimed the city reneged on its promise and sued.believing the allegations would require individual participation,the district court concluded the association lacked standing.id.at.relying on hospital council,the court of appeals reversed and remanded,holding the association could attempt to establish its allegations with limited membership participation id.at.
the mcos argue the medical coverage decisions on psychiatric care and substance abuse services,which form the basis of the organization allegations,are inquiries.for this reason,they assert the examination of medical care determinations will demand significant individual participation.to buttress this point,defendants note they offer subscribers various health care plans that in turn provide varying benefits.consequently,they argue,demonstrating any single coverage decision violated their obligations will entail a examination of a patient condition along with the corresponding available benefits.in support,defendants rely on rent stabilization association dinkins,where an association of landowners alleged rent regulations constituted an unconstitutional taking of their property.cir.there,the court of appeals for the second circuit held that the extensive individual testimony required to adjudicate the claims would violate hunt.id.at see also reid dep t of commerce,holding union lacked standing to assert back pay claims for its members because each claim depended on member individual circumstances.the court reasoned the claims foreclosed standing because it 
would have to engage in an ad hoc factual inquiry for each landlord who alleges that he has suffered a taking.the court would have to determine the landlord particular return based on a host of individualized financial data,and the court would have to investigate the reasons for any failure to obtain an adequate return,because the constitution certainly can not be read to guarantee a profit to an inefficient or incompetent landlord.
rent stabilization,at.but the court of appeals for the second circuit has not rejected associational standing where only limited individual participation by some members would be required.see state org.for women terry,cir association warranted standing although evidence from some individual members necessary see also ass of coll.bookstores,cambridge.press.we agree that conferring associational standing would be improper for claims requiring a inquiry.
the district court reviewed the pennsylvania psychiatric society restrictive treatment authorizations care determinations based on criteria besides medical necessity creation of improper obstacles to physician credentialing imposition of administrative requirements failure to pay psychiatrists for rendered services direct interference with found each assertion would necessitate significant individual participation.if this were true,the organization would not satisfy the associational standing requirements 
but the pennsylvania psychiatric society maintains the heart of its complaint involves systemic policy violations that will make extensive individual participation unnecessary.in effect,the society contends the methods the mcos employ for making,authorizing or denying mental health services,credentialing physicians,and breaches of contract as well as tortious conduct.therefore,insofar as its allegations concern how the mcos render these decisions,the society complaint involve s challenge s to alleged practices,hospital council,at,that may be established with sample testimony,which may not involve specific,factually intensive,individual medical care determinations.see virginia hosp.ass baliles,cir,aff on other grounds sub nom.wilder virginia hosp.ass n,d.
if the pennsylvania psychiatric society can establish these claims with limited individual participation,it would satisfy the requirements for associational standing.while we question whether the society can accomplish this,at this stage of the proceedings on a motion to dismiss for lack of standing,we review the sufficiency of the pleadings and must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint and must construe the complaint in favor of the plaintiff.trump hotels casino resorts,mirage resorts,cir citing warth,at.for this reason,we believe the society suit should not be dismissed before it is given the opportunity to establish the alleged violations without significant individual participation as noted,if the damages claims remained,we would affirm the dismissal under.b.moreover,as the organization concedes,if it can not adequately demonstrate the mcos breaches with limited individual participation,its suit should be dismissed.because this appeal arises on a motion to dismiss,the pennsylvania psychiatric society should be allowed to move forward with its claims within the boundaries of associational standing.therefore,we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the matter on this basis under.b.nevertheless,the district court is free to revisit this issue.
in addition to advancing the rights of its member psychiatrists,the pennsylvania psychiatric society seeks to assert the claims of its members patients who are also allegedly injured by defendants practices.because the patients are not members of,or otherwise directly associated with,the pennsylvania psychiatric society,the society does not have associational standing to assert their claims.nonetheless,the society maintains it may bring the patients claims under the doctrine of standing in particular,the society contends its member psychiatrists have standing to assert the claims of their patients,and the society has standing to bring the claims of its members,including their claims.defendants have challenged both of these steps.therefore,we must decide,first,whether the member psychiatrists have standing to bring the claims of their patients,and second,whether the pennsylvania psychiatric society has associational standing to assert these members claims.
apart from the constitutional requirements for standing courts have imposed a set of prudential limitations on the exercise of federal jurisdiction over claims.bennett spear,d t he federal judiciary has also adhered to a set of prudential principles that bear on the question of standing.quotation and citation omitted warth,at.powell ridge,cir.the restrictions against standing do not stem from the article iii case or controversy requirement,but rather from prudential concerns amato wilentz,cir,which prevent courts from deciding questions of broad social import where no individual rights would be vindicated and limit access to the federal courts to those litigants best suited to assert a particular claim.gladstone,realtors vill.of bellwood,d see also sec y of state joseph munson,d.
it is a tenet of standing that a litigant must assert his or her own legal rights and interests,and can not rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.powers ohio,d see also valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church and state,d wheeler travelers ins,cir.this principle is based on the assumption that third parties themselves usually will be the best proponents of their own rights,singleton wulff,d plurality opinion,which serves to foster judicial restraint and ensure the clear presentation of issues.see munson,at.
yet the prohibition is not invariable and our jurisprudence recognizes standing under certain circumstances campbell louisiana,d see also hodel irving,d acknowledging general rule that party must assert own interests is subject to exceptions.in particular,if a course of conduct prevents a from entering into a relationship with the litigant typically a contractual relationship,to which relationship the third party has a legal entitlement,standing may be appropriate.united states dep t of labor triplett,d see also munson,at.fundraiser had standing to challenge statute limiting fees charitable organizations could pay because law infringed on organizations right to hire fundraiser for a higher fee.
the supreme court has found that the principles animating these prudential concerns are not subverted if the third party is hindered from asserting its own rights and shares an identity of interests with the plaintiff.see craig,at.singleton,at.eisenstadt baird,d.more specifically,standing requires the satisfaction of three preconditions the plaintiff must suffer injury the plaintiff and the third party must have a close relationship and the third party must face some obstacles that prevent it from pursuing its own claims.campbell,at.powers,at.the pitt news,at.it remains for courts to balance these factors to determine if standing is warranted.amato,at.
although the pennsylvania psychiatric society itself has not suffered direct injury,it is uncontested that it properly pleaded that defendants policies and procedures have economically injured its member psychiatrists and undermined their ability to provide quality health care.thus,while the society does not itself stand in an appropriate relationship to the patients claims to directly assert them,its members may have standing to do so and because plaintiff seeks to establish standing on the basis of its members standing to bring these claims,the members are the appropriate focus of inquiry for these purposes.
we next turn to whether the psychiatrists and their patients have a sufficiently close relationship which will permit the physicians to effectively advance their patients claims.to meet this standard,this relationship must permit the psychiatrists to operate fully,or very nearly,as effective a proponent of their patients rights as the patients themselves powers,at.quoting singleton,at.
the patients relationships with their psychiatrists fulfills this requirement.see supra note.in singleton wulff,the supreme court granted physicians standing on behalf of their patients to challenge a statute prohibiting medicaid funding for certain abortions,d.because of the inherent closeness of the relationship,the plurality found the physicians could efficaciously advocate their patients interests.id.at.noting abortion decision is one in which the physician is intimately involved.the relationship forged between psychiatrists and their patients is equally compelling.
psychiatrists clearly have the kind of relationship with their patients which lends itself to advancing claims on their behalf.this intimate relationship and the resulting mental health treatment ensures psychiatrists can effectively assert their patients rights.because the pennsylvania psychiatric society alleges the mcos prevent patients from receiving necessary mental health services and psychiatrists from providing them,its member psychiatrists would be to litigate these claims for both parties,as their interests are clearly aligned.see amato,at noting relationship provides strong likelihood of effective advocacy by a physician on behalf of his patients.accordingly,we believe the relationship would satisfy the second criterion for standing 
finally,we examine whether the mental health patients face obstacles to pursuing litigation themselves.this criterion does not require an absolute bar from suit,but some hindrance to the third party ability to protect his or her own interests,powers,at.in other words,a party need not face insurmountable hurdles to warrant standing id.at.holding excluded juror limited incentive to bring discrimination suit satisfied obstacle requirement for criminal defendant to merit standing singleton,at.recognizing lawsuit invasion of patient privacy and imminent mootness of pregnancy sufficiently impeded patient from bringing suit herself.the district court found the patients mental health problems did not significantly hinder them from suing.we disagree.
the stigma associated with receiving mental health services presents a considerable deterrent to litigation.parham,d stewart,concurring there can be no doubt that commitment to a mental institution results in massive curtailment of liberty.in addition to the physical confinement involved,a person liberty is also substantially affected by the stigma attached to treatment in a mental hospital.quotations and citations omitted humphreys drug enforcement,cir noting psychiatric patients suffer a stigma in society quotation and citation omitted.for example,the supreme court recognized in singleton that the obstacles confronted by women in opposing an abortion statute were not overwhelming.in fact,the court acknowledged the suit could have been brought pseudonymously or as a class.singleton,at.the court still concluded that a woman desire to protect her privacy could discourage her from bringing suit and constituted a sufficient impediment.id.at.these concerns apply with equal,if not greater,force to mental health patients.see bd.of trustees of of garrett,d there can be little doubt,then,that persons with mental or physical impairments are confronted with prejudice which can stem from indifference or insecurity as well as from malicious ill will.kennedy,concurring.besides the stigmatization that may blunt mental health patients incentive to pursue litigation,their impaired condition may prevent them from being able to assert their claims.therefore,we believe the patients fear of stigmatization,coupled with their potential incapacity to pursue legal remedies,operates as a powerful deterrent to bringing suit.
because the claims asserted by the pennsylvania psychiatric society do not implicate any constitutional rights of the psychiatrists patients,the mcos contend that granting standing is unwarranted.while successful standing claims have involved alleged violations of third parties constitutional rights,singleton and its progeny have not stipulated that constitutional claims are a prerequisite it is true that the rule against standing normally bars litigants from asserting the rights or legal interests of others in order to obtain relief from injury to themselves.warth,at.furthermore,the supreme court has noted that courts must consider the relationship of the litigant to the person whose rights are being asserted the ability of the person to advance his own rights and the impact of the litigation on interests.caplin drysdale,at.but the court has not held that a constitutional claim must also be alleged,see,powers,at,and absent further guidance,we will not impose this requirement.for these reasons,we hold the pennsylvania psychiatric society member psychiatrists would have standing to assert the claims of their patients.
the pennsylvania psychiatric society contends it has standing to bring these claims just as it has standing to bring its members other claims under the doctrine of associational standing.defendants maintain the patients claims are too attenuated from the society to permit derivative standing.
we decline to adopt a per se rule barring such derivative claims.the supreme court did not delineate in hunt which types of claims associations could bring on behalf of their members,but rather simply held that an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when the requisite elements are established.hunt,at.
the limitations on derivative standing,therefore,are to be determined by applying the test for associational standing specified in hunt.our holding that the pennsylvania psychiatric society has alleged facts sufficient to establish the standing of its members to bring their patients claims implies the satisfaction of only the first requirement of the hunt its members would otherwise have standing to bring these claims.a claim must also meet the requirements that the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and that neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.id.these factors inform the analysis whether an association stands in the correct relationship to a claim to allow it to assert that claim on behalf of others.
other courts of appeals have adopted this approach in finding standing in similar cases.in fraternal order of police united states,the court of appeals for the district of columbia granted an organization derivative authority to assert the claims of its members,t he presence of the chief law enforcement officers as members gives the order standing to make these claims as well.the fraternal order of police sued to contest the constitutionality of federal legislation that prohibited supplying firearms to police officers convicted of domestic violence.id.at.because a chief law enforcement officer would be liable for supplying a firearm to a subordinate convicted of domestic violence and because the failure to supply a weapon could also violate the subordinate officer rights,the court of appeals found the chiefs had standing to advance the claims of their officers.id.at.since the chiefs were members of the fraternal order of police,the association had standing to advance the chiefs claims as well as the claims of their subordinates.similar to this case,none of the members were themselves party to the suit 
the court of appeals for the sixth circuit also granted an organization derivative authority to enjoin the enforcement of a statute requiring private schools to administer proficiency tests in ohio association of independent schools goff,cir.as parties to the litigation,the association member schools had standing because failure to comply with the statute would result in the loss of their school charters.id.at.the private schools also had standing to assert the constitutional right of their students parents to direct their children education.because its member schools could be injured by the statute,the ohio association of independent schools also had standing to assert their claims.since its member schools had standing to assert the rights of the parents,the court held the ohio association of independent schools also had standing to sue on behalf of the parents whose children attended its members schools.id.the member schools have standing on behalf of parents of students who are threatened with the nonreceipt of diplomas.consequently,the oais itself,as an organization dedicated exclusively to advancing the interests of the member schools,has associational standing to challenge the statutes at issue.thus,while some member intermediate parties to the dispute,the sixth circuit standing analysis did not rely on that fact.we see a compelling analogy between these cases and the claims before us,and believe the pennsylvania psychiatric society may have standing to assert its members claims.
the district court found the pennsylvania psychiatric society lacked derivative authority to pursue the claims of its members patients because it had not suffered direct injury itself.on this point,defendants contend goff is inapt because the court of appeals for the sixth circuit did not require that the association suffer injury in fact.see amato,at.this criticism is misplaced.it is generally true that standing requires the party who advances the interests of another party to also suffer discrete injury.as noted previously,this prudential requirement sharpens presentation of claims and avoids litigation of general grievances.but when an association,which has not sustained direct injury,obtains standing to pursue the claims of its members,the association may rely on the injuries sustained by its members to satisfy the requirement.consequently,once an organization members establish standing,the prudential concerns are alleviated if the association also has authority to assert its members claims.
it is a anomaly of representational standing that the individuals who have sustained the requisite injury to satisfy the constitutional and prudential standing criteria are not in fact responsible for bringing suit.so long as the association members have or will suffer sufficient injury to merit standing and their members possess standing to represent the interests of,then associations can advance the claims of their members without suffering injuries themselves if on remand the pennsylvania psychiatric society warrants associational standing to represent its members,we conclude it also may have derivative authority to raise the claims of its members patients 
we now consider the arbitration provision in the provider agreement between the mcos and the psychiatrists the pennsylvania psychiatric society argues that the district court erred in holding all its claims were subject to mandatory arbitration.the society contends the arbitration provision should not apply to its member psychiatrists for several reasons the arbitration provision is an unconscionable contract of adhesion the organization claims are beyond the scope of the arbitration provision claims regarding the process of determining medical necessity fall outside the purview of arbitration and pursuing these claims through the available internal review procedures would be futile and the psychiatrists with initial credentialing or claims do not have contracts with the mcos requiring arbitration 
because it denied the society associational and standing to advance the claims of its members patients,the district court did not did not examine whether the patients claims would be subject to mandatory arbitration.the district court only reviewed the effect of the arbitration provision on the credentialed psychiatrists who are society members.it strikes us that,assuming the society has standing to assert the claims of each party,the district court will have to the scope as well as the effect of the arbitration provision on all the parties involved.because we find the pennsylvania psychiatric society survives a motion to dismiss for lack of standing,the district court must sort through,in the first instance,the impact of the psychiatrists arbitration clause on the alleged claims.
we will reverse and remand the dismissal of the pennsylvania psychiatric society complaint for lack of standing.depending on the level of individual participation necessary to demonstrate its claims,the society may have standing to press the claims of its member psychiatrists and their patients.of course,we express no opinion as to the merits of any of the claims or defenses.
we will reverse the order of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i agree with much of what the majority has said.i part company,however,with its conclusion that grants pps a of derivative standing.pps argues that it has standing to litigate,not the interests of its,but rather the issues and interests of its are three steps removed from pps.pps argument has three premises.its first two premises are exceptions to the standing rule that pps has associational standing to litigate on behalf of its and,that its have standing to litigate on behalf of their patients.its third premise is that these exceptions can be stacked to concoct a new exception to the standing rule.pps thus concludes that it should have standing to litigate on behalf if its members patients.
the first two premises are sound,but i disagree with the majority on the third.pps can not two discrete exceptions,to swallow up the rule that litigants must assert their own rights and interests.i can not find,nor does pps cite,any authority for stacking or these relationships into an attenuated concatenation of exceptions to the standing rule so as to confer standing on pps.i would hold that pps can not seek relief based upon the rights and interests of remote third parties.i must therefore respectfully dissent on this point.
central to my conclusion is that pps third premise runs afoul of amato wilentz,cir,wherein we discussed the objectives and standards for standing.although standing typically proves to be a nebulous prudential doctrine,sensitive to the particularities and peculiarities of the relationship between the parties and their claims,we distilled a basic test for standing in amato.id.at.we require that the party seeking standing must first have suffered an injury in fact.if the party seeking standing has suffered an injury in fact,the court must then examine further,considering a the intimacy of the relationship between the parties b any impediment the party might have to advancing its own rights and c the identity of the interests between the parties.id.at.
applying the amato standards,the district court first found that pps did not itself suffer an injury.no one disputes this fact.i agree with the district court that because pps has not even alleged a concrete injury to itself,it can not satisfy amato most elementary standard.standing should be denied to pps on this test alone.
the district court,however,continued and found that even if pps had alleged an injury in fact to itself,amato subsequent elements,or balancing tests,would not favor pps standing for its members patients.the district court found that the relationship between pps and the patient subscribers is so attenuated as to weigh against pps to bring suit on behalf of persons with which it has no direct relationship.the district court next found that there appears to be no impediment to the patients seeking to enforce their legal claims themselves and the patients face no affirmative obstacle to sue.i agree with the district court that even had pps shown an,the subsequent balancing test would not confer standing on pps.the argument that psychiatric patients may face some impediment to bringing these claims themselves,because of the stigma attached to mental illness and psychiatric care,is mere speculation,and moreover,this factor is counterbalanced by the remoteness of the relationship between pps and its members patients.the relationship between pps and the patients is nothing like the intimacy that supports that exception to the standing rule.
thus the district court held that pps should be denied standing for its member patients for three distinct reasons pps suffered no injury in fact and therefore the court did not need to entertain the secondary balancing factors set forth in amato even if pps did merit consideration under the balancing test,the balancing test would not weigh in favor of granting standing since pps relationship with its members patients is too attenuated and the patients have no substantial obstacle to bringing their claims independently.i agree with all three reasons,and with the district court conclusion.
pps argues to us that the district court ignored significant case law recognizing derivative standing.nonsense.none of the cases pps cites are directly on point.pps and its amici cite cases that confer standing to doctors to litigate on behalf of their patients.but this does nothing to advance pps argument on the stacking issue presented here.pps cites both american college of obstetricians thornburgh,cir and ohio association of independent schools goff,cir,to support the notion that an association may assert claims that could be brought by its members.neither of these cases stand for such a notion.
in ohio association,the association,along with several of its member schools,sought standing for parents of children in the schools to challenge the requirement of state formulated testing in private schools.ohio association,at.the court found that the oais member schools also have standing to assert the constitutional right of parents to direct their children education.id.at emphasis added.thus the court did not find that the association had standing to assert parents interests,but that individual schools had standing to do so.thus the operative distinction between ohio association and pps argument is that in ohio association both the association and its individual members jointly brought the suit,but here,pps attempts to bring its claims to court without the participation of any of its members.
american college presents the same problems for pps.in american college,the challenge was brought by a team of an association,doctors,and medical providers.american college,at.in a footnote the court stated that the district court concluded that plaintiff physicians,acog,and medical providers all had standing to raise their own interests or the interests of members and those of patients and customers in challenging the act constitutionality.we affirm this general conclusion.id.at.as in ohio association,the standing questions in american college turned on the doctors actually participating in the suit.the reason is obvious the doctors provide the standing bridge between the association and the patients.all of the support cited in american college demonstrates the need for physicians to participate in the suit to establish standing.id.citing city of akron akron ctr.for reprod.health,d challenge by abortion clinics and a physician planned parenthood ass ashcroft,d challenge by planned parenthood,two physicians and an abortion
