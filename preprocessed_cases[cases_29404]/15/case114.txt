in,congress enacted the driver privacy protection act the dppa.as its name suggests,the dppa,with limited exceptions,protects drivers privacy by prohibiting state motor vehicle departments and others from disclosing personal information drawn from motor vehicle records.
in this case,defendant aron leifer,a private citizen,engaged in a verbal altercation with the driver of a motor vehicle.miffed,he wrote down the license plate number of the car.using an online private investigative service and paying a fee of just,leifer was later able to use the license plate number to obtain the name and home address of the vehicle owner,erik gordon.leifer then embarked on a campaign to harass gordon and his family.
gordon commenced this action below against leifer and the entities and individuals who obtained the information from the new york state department of motor vehicles and released it,ultimately,to leifer.gordon asserted claims under the dppa and state law.gordon eventually settled his claims against leifer,but the district court berman,dismissed his claims against the remaining defendants on summary judgment.gordon appeals.we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.
background 
statutory framework 
congress passed the dppa in.see,tit.xxx codified as amended at.the dppa generally restricts state departments of motor vehicles dmvs from disclosing personal information drawn from motor vehicle records.a see also reno condon,upholding constitutionality of dppa.similarly,private citizens or entities ordinarily may not obtain,disclose,or resell personal information unless permitted by statute.a,c.notwithstanding these default rules of,the dppa identifies fourteen permissible uses exceptions from the default rule for which personal information may be obtained,disclosed,used,or resold.id.b c.penalties,both civil and criminal,enforce the rights of private citizens to be left alone.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of harkin,available at wl id.at statement of robb noting that dppa would place safeguards on the privacy of the driver and vehicle owners see also.
the dppa was enacted following the highly publicized murder of an actress,whose had received her home address through an information request at a local dmv.andrea ford,fan convicted of murder in actress slaying,times,see also,cong.rec.daily ed,statement of moran,available at wl.during the floor debate,members of congress emphasized that personal information accessed from state dmvs was often used in connection with criminal or threatening behavior.see,cong.rec.daily ed,statement of moran,available at wl cong.rec,daily ed,statements of boxer and harkin,available at wl.the dppa was therefore enacted to limit the disclosure of personal information drawn from motor vehicle records and to prevent its misuse.
data brokers resellers 
reid rodriguez is the and chief operating officer of softech international,together,softech.softech acts as a gateway,providing access to motor vehicle records of all fifty states,the district of columbia,puerto rico,and six provinces in canada.see mvr driving records,softech international,last visited july.a data broker,softech collect s information,including personal information about consumers,from a wide variety of sources for the purpose of reselling such information to their consumers for various purposes.fed.trade comm n,protecting consumer privacy in an era of rapid change recommendations for businesses and policymakers,at,available at.information aggregated by entities such as softech can aid law enforcement actions.disclosures,however,may also be made to private citizens or entities,and individuals are often unaware that their personal information is being aggregated and sold.see id.
dan cohn owns and operates arcanum investigations together,arcanum,a private investigation service.by agreement,softech provides arcanum with access to its motor vehicle records arcanum represents that it and,to the extent it resells this information,any end user will use the information in a manner permitted by law.
arcanum owns and operates.for a small fee,provides its users with the personal information associated with,for example,a license plate number.when a user inputs a new york state license plate number,arcanum provides that number to softech and requests the associated motor vehicle record for private investigative purposes.arcanum can not access new york state motor vehicle records directly from the state dmv,and hence it requests this information from softech.then,pursuant to their agreement,softech relays the motor vehicle record for that license plate number to arcanum.arcanum,through the website,then provides that information to its customer.
thus,arcanum and softech are both resellers together,the resellers of personal information drawn from motor vehicle records.
c.the facts 
except as noted below,we construe the facts in the light most favorable to gordon,the party opposing summary judgment.on the evening of october,gordon was dining at a restaurant in new york city.his driver waited outside in gordon car,a vintage london taxicab.its new york state license plate was registered in gordon name.
leifer was parked across the street in an suv.he and gordon driver engaged in a brief verbal altercation.gordon driver drove away,but leifer gave chase.gordon driver then drove to a police precinct on east street and waited for leifer to leave the area.the driver then returned to wait for gordon outside the restaurant.
the parties dispute whether the two cars collided that evening.leifer claimed that they did,but he never contacted the police or filed an insurance claim.at some point that night,leifer wrote down the license plate number of gordon vehicle.
the next day,on october,leifer input gordon license plate number on.from a dropdown menu of purposes deemed by to be permissible under the dppa,leifer selected insurance other.a popup window noted 
you are required to select a dppa permissible purpose.by imputting sic your response,you hereby certify that you are in,and assume full responsibility for,compliance with the driver privacy protection act of dppa and you agree to indemnify,defend and hold docusearch harmless from any breach of the dppa by you,your agents or contractors and any damages,fees and costs associated therewith.
leifer clicked ok.to finalize the purchase,requested his personal information.leifer provided an alias jack loren and stated that he worked for a business,later discovered to be defunct,called.he also provided a credit card number,which he represented was issued to jack loren when,in fact,it was issued in leifer own name.finally,mere hours after making a payment,leifer received gordon name and home address.
using this information,leifer executed a series of internet searches and identified gordon phone number,the members of gordon family and acquaintances,and their contact information.leifer then called gordon assistant,his mother,and his father secretary.during these calls,leifer made threatening comments,which included,to gordon mother,the false allegation that gordon had sexually assaulted a woman.leifer does not deny making phone calls,but asserts that,due to the alleged collision,he merely tried to contact gordon to request his insurance information.
procedural history 
gordon amended complaint dated january,alleged that leifer and the resellers had violated the dppa specifically,gordon contended that leifer had misused his personal information and that the resellers either unreasonably disclosed it or were strictly liable for leifer misdeeds.defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss in march,which the district court denied.see gordon softech int l,civ,wl.
after discovery,the parties for summary judgment.in a november,decision order,the district court denied gordon motion for summary judgment,but granted in part and denied in part the motion filed jointly by resellers and leifer.without addressing gordon alternative theory that resellers were subject to a duty of reasonable inquiry,the court concluded that,as a matter of law,resellers could not be strictly liable for leifer alleged dppa violation and granted summary judgment in favor of the resellers.gordon softech int l,d.as to leifer,however,the district court concluded that material questions of fact precluded summary judgment regarding his liability under the dppa id.at.
on december,gordon filed a letter seeking a conference to request reconsideration of the district court decision.gordon argued that a genuine issue of material fact exist ed as to whether the resellers conduct in relying on the representations.constitute d a willful or reckless violation of the dppa.the district court subsequently set a trial date for gordon claim against leifer while also noting that the trial date of course is without prejudice to your application for reconsideration.before trial,gordon and leifer settled their dispute.
by a january,order,the district court discontinued the action.on february,in response to an inquiry from gordon,the district court issued a decision order stating that the motion for reconsideration had been discontinued by its prior order as it was rendered moot when the parties settled.it further noted that,even if the motion were not moot,it would have been denied for substantially the same reasons set forth in the court earlier decision.
on february,gordon appealed from the district court grant of summary judgment to resellers,order of discontinuance,and denial of the motion of reconsideration.
discussion 
undisputedly,softech disclosed gordon personal information,drawn from a motor vehicle record,to arcanum,which then disclosed it to leifer.assuming leifer used the information for improper purposes,we now consider whether resellers may be liable to gordon under the dppa,and,if so,the circumstances under which liability may arise 
applicable law 
standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment after construing all evidence,and drawing all reasonable inferences,in favor of the party.see,mcelwee cnty.of orange,cir.furthermore,our review of a district court interpretation of a federal statute is also de novo.see,muller costello,cir.
rules of construction 
when construing a statute,we begin with the plain meaning and give all undefined terms their ordinary construction.see schindler elevator united states ex rel.kirk,united states desposito,cir.we are mindful,of course,that a n exception to a general statement of policy is usually read narrowly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision.maracich spears,omission,quotation,and internal quotation marks omitted.our analysis,absent ambiguity,will generally end there.collazos united states,cir.
if,however,the statute is ambiguous,we focus upon the broader context and primary purpose of the statute.castellano city of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in so doing,we may turn to the legislative history as a reflection of congressional intent.see puello bureau of citizenship immigration,cir.in all events,however,we must construe the statute so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant.corley united states,quotation omitted.
under the dppa,state dmvs,individuals,organizations,and entities may not disclose personal information drawn from motor vehicle records unless permitted by statute a state entities,a private individuals and entities see also reno,at upholding constitutionality of dppa.the default rule is one of,but the statute also identifies fourteen exceptions permissible uses for which disclosure is allowed.see b.in relevant part,
personal information protected by the dppa may be disclosed as follows 
for use by any insurer or insurance support organization,or by a entity,or its agents,employees,or contractors,in connection with claims investigation activities,antifraud activities,rating or underwriting.
for use by any licensed private investigative agency or licensed security service for any purpose permitted under this subsection.
the dppa also regulates the resale and redisclosure of protected personal information 
an authorized recipient of personal information except a recipient under subsection b or may resell or redisclose the information only for a use permitted under subsection b but not for uses under subsection b or.
id.c authorized recipient is not defined by statute.but see reno,at citing section c and declaring that dppa regulates resale and redisclosure by private persons who have obtained drivers personal information from a state dmv.
the dppa creates a civil cause of action for those whose information has been improperly used or disclosed.see a.certain civil remedies may be imposed against any person who knowingly obtains,discloses or uses personal information,from a motor vehicle record,for a purpose not permitted by the dppa.id.these remedies vary the court may award 
actual damages,but not less than liquidated damages in the amount of 
punitive damages upon proof of willful or reckless disregard of the law 
reasonable attorneys fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred and 
such other preliminary and equitable relief as the court determines to be appropriate.
application 
gordon argues that the resellers are subject to civil penalties under the dppa.first,gordon contends that the resellers should be strictly liable for misuses of his information by downstream recipients.second,in the alternative,gordon asserts that resellers are liable because of their own actions a resellers disclosed his information for a use that was not expressly permitted by the dppa,and b resellers did not exercise due care when releasing his personal information.we address each argument in turn.
strict liability for downstream acts 
gordon primarily argues that resellers should be held strictly liable for civil penalties based on leifer improper use of gordon personal information.we conclude that a strict liability standard is inconsistent with the dppa as a whole and would frustrate its legislative aims.
the text of the dppa does not support either explicitly or implicitly a strict liability standard.although,as described below,the text and structure of the dppa can be read to support a duty of reasonable inquiry,nothing in the dppa suggests that a reseller is responsible,regardless of whether it is at fault,for an end user misuse of personal information.moreover,no case law interpreting the dppa suggests that a reseller could be strictly liable for downstream violations by another party.but pichler unite,cir end user liable for own actions,even if it did not know those actions would violate dppa.
we note,moreover,that strict liability offenses,while not unknown to the criminal law,are generally disfavored.united states gypsum,see also united states burwell,anti discrimination comm.city of dearborn,cir.gordon appeal,of course,arises in the civil context,but the provision describing a criminal offense under the dppa mirrors the language describing a civil cause of action this similarity suggests that knowingly is read the same way in both provisions.see dep t of revenue of or.acf,normal rule of statutory construction is that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning quotation and internal quotation marks omitted.but see kirtsaeng john wiley sons,acknowledging general rule,but applying different canon of interpretation.we are loathe to write strict liability into the dppa absent a clear indication in the text or the legislative history that strict liability applies.
the notion of strict liability is also inconsistent with at least some of the congressional concerns that prompted the dppa.the dppa sought to strike a critical balance between an individual fundamental right to privacy and safety and the legitimate governmental and business needs for this information.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of moran,available at wl see also id.at statement of goss.congress knew that legitimate businesses used information derived from motor vehicle records and ensured continued access to it through the dppa.see,cong.rec.daily ed,statement of hatch,available at wl driver privacy protection act hearings on before the subcomm.on civil constitutional rights of the house of comm.on the judiciary,cong.in fact,congress was cognizant of the concerns raised by the business community,and consequently it broadened the exceptions to in the law.see cong.rec.daily ed,statement of moran noting that revised dppa addressed commercial concerns raised during subcommittee hearings,available at wl.
w e will not interpret a statute in a way that apparently frustrates the statute goals,in the absence of a specific congressional intention otherwise.united states livecchi,cir quoting new york shore realty,cir.thus,because we conclude that neither the text nor the legislative history of the dppa supports reading a strict liability standard into the dppa,we hold that resellers are not strictly liable for leifer improper use of gordon personal information.
resellers liability due to their own actions 
disclosure for an impermissible use 
gordon contends that the resellers disclosed his personal information for a use that was not specifically identified in the dppa list of fourteen exceptions.see b.we review the disclosure of each reseller separately and conclude that,while softech disclosed gordon personal information for a permitted use,a material question of fact exists as to the propriety of arcanum disclosure.
gordon alleges that softech disclosed his personal information to arcanum even though arcanum did not identify a permissible use this argument is meritless.when arcanum,a private investigative agency,requested gordon personal information from softech,it selected dppa purpose.rodriguez dep,cohn dep.this corresponds to the exception in section b,f or use by any licensed private investigative agency for any purpose permitted under this subsection.b see also rodriguez dep.
hence,this exception includes two limiting factors the entities that may claim the exception,and the purposes for which information may be requested.arcanum request satisfied both requirements.first,as discussed above,arcanum was a licensed private investigative agency and therefore eligible to claim the exception.second,arcanum had provided softech with an affidavit of intended use that specifically identified three intended uses for the records requested,all of which complied with exceptions in section b 
when softech accessed the new york state dmv database and provided arcanum with gordon name,address,and additional information pertaining to his car,it disclosed that information pursuant to an exception in section b,to an entity eligible to invoke the exception,for three purposes permitted by the dppa.see b.therefore,the district court correctly concluded as a matter of law that softech had disclosed gordon personal information for a use expressly permitted by statute 
ii.arcanum 
arcanum disclosed gordon personal information to leifer based on leifer selection of insurance other from the dropdown menu.gordon contends that insurance other did not correspond to a permitted use 
although resellers insist that gordon waived this argument by failing to raise it below,we disagree.gordon amended complaint noted that arcanum disclosed gordon personal information without a permissible use under the dppa.amended complaint.this necessarily implied that gordon challenged whether the stated use insurance other fell within the section b exceptions furthermore,gordon argued below that to qualify under the insurance exception you have to either be an insurance company or a entity,at.counsel for arcanum was present,but did not object.accordingly,we determine that the issue was not waived.
under a textual approach,insurance other does not track the language of the insurance exception,which allows a person to disclose or use personal information in connection with claims investigation activities,antifraud activities,rating or underwriting.b.thus,a disclosure for insurance other could be outside the scope of the statute,as the generic phrase encompasses many activities beyond the stated activities of section b.see maracich.at examining dppa litigation exception and noting that u nless commanded by the text these exceptions ought not operate to the farthest reach of their linguistic possibilities if that result would contravene the statutory design.
the insurance exception,moreover,may only be claimed by certain entities an insurer or insurance support organization,or a entity.id.b.when deposed,leifer conceded that he did not work at an insurance company,and could not identify what a entity or an insurance support organization was.leifer dep.to,july.arcanum has pointed to nothing in the record to suggest that leifer was,in fact,eligible to request information pursuant to that exception.thus,even if we were to assume that a collision had occurred,an insurance claim had accrued,and insurance other was coterminous with section b,a reasonable jury could easily find that leifer was not eligible to request information pursuant to the insurance exception.
the resellers insist that insurance other covered all uses,but only to the extent contemplated by the exception in section b.this argument relies on the fact that each customer certified that it was in,and assume d full responsibility for,compliance with the driver privacy protection act of by clicking ok on a window.furthermore,the customer also checked a box,thereby consenting to the terms of a client agreement,in which the customer represent ed and warrant ed that it will provide docusearch with accurate and complete information regarding the searches requested,and that search results will not be used for any purpose other than the purpose stated to docusearch.
we need not decide whether these representations sufficiently narrowed the scope of insurance other resellers argument still ignores the fact that only certain entities are eligible to claim the insurance exception.whether leifer is one of them is determinative of arcanum liability.if leifer was not eligible to claim that exception,arcanum disclosure would have been for a use not permitted by section b.hence,with respect to arcanum,we conclude that the district court erred by granting summary judgment without having first considered whether leifer was eligible to request information pursuant to the insurance exception,if so,whether a collision had occurred,and if so,whether an insurance claim had accrued.these material questions of fact preclude summary judgment as to arcanum liability.
resellers duty of reasonable care legal framework 
gordon further contends that,even if resellers disclosed his personal information for what they believed to be a permitted use,they are still liable because they violated a duty of reasonable care imposed by the dppa.resellers contend that the dppa imposes no such duty.based on the language of the statute,its structure,and its legislative history,we conclude that the dppa imposes a duty on resellers to exercise reasonable care in responding to requests for personal information drawn from motor vehicle records.
i.the statutory language 
the default rule under the dppa is.it is unlawful for a state dmv or any employee or officer thereof to knowingly disclose or otherwise make available to any person or entity personal information obtained from a motor vehicle record,except as provided in section b.a.resellers are subject to the same general rule of with limited exceptions not relevant here,resellers may resell or redisclose the information only for a use permitted under subsection b.id.c emphasis added see also taylor acxiom,cir.
moreover,the dppa creates a civil cause of action for unauthorized disclosure section a provides that a person who knowingly obtains,discloses or uses personal information,from a motor vehicle record,for a purpose not permitted under this chapter shall be liable to the individual to whom the information pertains,who may bring a civil action in a united states district court.a.logically,the language makes clear,albeit implicitly,that resellers are obliged to use some care in disclosing personal information obtained from motor vehicle records.if resellers may not disclose personal information except as permitted by the dppa,they must be obliged to make some inquiry before concluding that disclosure is permitted.see also roth guzman,cir clay,dissenting rejecting notion that upstream source had no actual duty other than the ministerial task of soliciting rote representations from prospective requesters of personal information.it would make no sense that this obligation could be met simply by accepting an end user mere in the presence of red flags suggesting the requested information was being sought for an improper purpose.under this theory,advocated by resellers,an upstream source could always avoid liability by securing a representation that the recipient of personal information had a permissible use or by hiding behind one or more dropdown menus so that a user would always and could only select a permitted use.the civil remedies provision would be rendered toothless if resellers could insulate themselves from liability based solely on the conclusory representations of end users,without being required to exercise due care themselves.
we note also that the statute use of the word knowingly is not inconsistent with the notion that some duty of care exists.id.case law is replete with situations where knowledge contemplates what a party knew or should have known.negligence law in particular frequently invokes the concept of constructive knowledge when deciding whether a particular outcome was foreseeable and criminal law applies a similar concept when imposing criminal liability under a theory of conscious avoidance 
ii.the structure of the civil penalties provision 
the structure of the dppa also supports the conclusion that resellers owe a duty of reasonable care.the dppa provides that a court may award punitive damages upon proof of willful or reckless disregard of the law.b see also pichler,at willful or reckless disregard is when a party appreciated it was engaging in wrongful conduct internal quotation marks omitted.in contrast,the preceding subdivision provides that the court may award actual damages,but not less than liquidated damages in the amount of.b.the actual damages provision is silent as to the degree of fault necessary to trigger liability for actual damages.if,however,as the statute suggests,punitive damages are available only for willful and reckless violations of the dppa,then actual damages must require something less that is,conduct that is neither willful nor reckless.
as we have rejected a theory of strict liability,the most appropriate standard,in our view,is reasonableness a reasonableness standard best harmonizes the wording,the structure,and,as discussed below,the purpose of the dppa.accordingly,we conclude that a reseller is liable for actual or liquidated damages when it fails to use reasonable care to ensure that personal information is being obtained for a permissible purpose.
we note too that the department of justice doj has reached a similar conclusion.in a advisory opinion,doj concluded that a state dmv could release personal information to resellers upon reasonably concluding that the information requested by the commercial distributor will be used for authorized purposes only.letter from robert mcfetridge,special counsel to the assistant att y,civil,dep t of justice,to peter sacks,office of the att y,the commonwealth of,on file with the court hereinafter doj letter,at emphasis added see also,graczyk publ g,cir discussing doj letter,cert.denied.taylor,f d at same.an entity can not reasonably conclude that a person or entity may access personal information if it does not exercise some modicum of care.see cook acs state local solutions,cir summarizing doj letter as stating that states must reasonably conclude that the information would be used only for authorized purposes.
iii.the legislative history 
we acknowledge that there is some ambiguity in the statute.the dppa does not explicitly provide for a duty of reasonable care,and it is silent as to the degree of fault necessary for an award of actual or liquidated damages.
moreover,the word knowingly,as used in sections a and a,is ambiguous depending on one reading of the statute,civil liability could attach to any act committed intentionally,or only for an act undertaken with knowledge of an improper purpose.for example,in pichler unite,cir,the third circuit concluded that the end user a union could be civilly liable for using personal information for an improper purpose even though,at the time,the union did not know that its purpose would be deemed improper.id.at.by contrast,in roth guzman,cir,the sixth circuit concluded that a state dmv was not subject to civil liability under the dppa unless it actually knew that the recipient,who had represented that it had a permissible use for the requested personal information,would use it for an improper purpose.id.at.we need not resolve the disagreement,however,as both pichler addressing use by an end user and roth addressing disclosure by the state are distinguishable from this case,which addresses disclosure by resellers.
in light of the ambiguity in the statute,we look to its legislative history,and the legislative history supports the conclusion that resellers must exercise some degree of care.the legislative history emphasized that the dppa would protect an individual fundamental right to privacy and safety.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of moran,available at wl see also id.at statement of goss.protecting this right was particularly important in light of two mandates associated with driving all drivers must register with the state,and no drivers may obscure the license plate number on their cars.see cong.rec.daily ed,statement of boxer,available at wl cong.rec.daily ed,statement of moran,available at wl cong.rec.daily ed,statement of warner,available at wl drivers that register with the dmv should do so with full confidence that the information they provide will not be disclosed indiscriminately.because disclosures,such as the one made by softech to arcanum to leifer,are often totally incompatible with the purpose for which the information was collected,regulating the circumstances of disclosure was of paramount importance to congress.see cong.rec.daily ed,statement of boxer,available at wl.
concerns that state actions had undermined public safety also catalyzed the enactment of the dppa,which was passed as part of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of,stat.congress perceived a need to better regulate disclosure of personal information because such disclosures had been used to stalk,rob,and even kill private citizens.see,cong.rec.daily ed,statement of moran,available at wl cong.rec,daily ed,statements of boxer and harkin.assuming gordon allegations are true,leifer threats to gordon family and friends were precisely the sort of acts that congress sought to curtail.
given the nature of information available through motor vehicle records,social security number,medical or disability information,and home address the dppa purpose would be severely undermined if resellers disclosures were not subject to a duty of reasonable inquiry.see reno,at the dppa regulates the universe of entities that participate as suppliers to the market for motor vehicle information the states as initial suppliers of the information in interstate commerce and private resellers or redisclosers of that information in commerce.emphasis added.and,in light of the clear congressional intent to safeguard the privacy and safety of drivers,it is inconceivable that a dropdown menu,a check box,and a representation that no laws would be violated could satisfy any reasonable diligence floor.see cong.rec.daily ed,statement of robb,available at wl see also roth,at clay,dissenting t he dppa compels the conclusion that the act imposes a duty of reasonable inquiry.welch jones,d,no dppa violation in reseller disclosure where recipient identified its permissible use under penalties of perjury,and reseller verified recipient identity,even though the recipient ultimately used the information impermissibly.
in light of the text,structure,and legislative history of the dppa,we hold that resellers are subject to a duty of reasonable care before disclosing personal information see b c.
resellers duty of reasonable care as applied to softech and arcanum 
softech released gordon personal information per arcanum request for use by any licensed private investigative agency.rodriguez dep.moreover,softech and arcanum had an ongoing business relationship through which softech knew arcanum was a licensed private investigative agency,and arcanum had contractually agreed that it would only use information for three purposes permitted by the dppa.hence,at a minimum,softech disclosures to arcanum were permitted by the private investigative agency exception.see b.nothing in the record suggests that,in complying with the information request,softech acted unreasonably.
gordon contends that softech disclosure was still unreasonable because arcanum affidavit of intended use affirmed that arcanum would only use information for three stated purposes none of which were for public investigative services furthermore,the agreement provided that arcanum was required to strictly abide by the terms of the affidavit.softech contends that its automated system would check that the dppa permissible use selected is the one that they actually,upon signing up with us,was the one that they selected on the affidavit of intended use,and reject the request if it were not.rodriguez dep.yet when arcanum requested information pursuant to an exception not listed on its affidavit of intended use,softech did not reject arcanum request instead,it released gordon personal information.
we do not believe that these circumstances create a genuine issue of fact for trial.although,when it initially entered into a relationship with softech,arcanum agreed that it would seek information only for three permissible purposes,no legal obstacles prevented arcanum from requesting information from softech or precluded softech from giving information to arcanum for other permissible purposes in the future.moreover,arcanum was,in fact,a licensed private investigative agency,and arcanum had provided softech with an affidavit of intended use that promised that arcanum would use the information only in accordance with the requirements in section b.further,as a reseller,softech disclosure,to a user for an apparently permissible use,was permitted under section c finally,even assuming that softech had inquired further,nothing in the record suggests that softech would have uncovered any red flags suggesting the information was being sought for an improper purpose.hence,we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of softech.
ii.arcanum 
by contrast,we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that arcanum failed to exercise reasonable care when it disclosed gordon personal information to leifer.in seeking the information,leifer used the alias jack loren.he used a credit card number that did not match the name jack loren.he claimed he worked for a business,that was not operational.he selected a purpose,insurance other,that,at least arguably,is not a permitted purpose.he did not provide any information or proof relating to his status as an insurance company,a entity,or an insurance support organization,to verify his eligibility to invoke the insurance exception.
arcanum failed to inquire as to leifer eligibility to invoke the insurance exception,and it never checked the accuracy of the purported jack loren identity or the purported business affiliation.arcanum apparently did not even bother to verify whether the name associated with the credit card number provided by jack loren matched the name associated with the account.
moreover,the dropdown menu offered a selection of fourteen purportedly permissible purpose s,and instructed the customer that he must select one of the purportedly permissible purposes.thus,the website was designed as a reasonable jury could so find to ensure that end users selected one of fourteen purportedly permissible purposes,without providing them with an opportunity to articulate the true purpose permissible or not behind a particular records request.although arcanum did ask leifer to represent that he was seeking the information for a lawful purpose,a reasonable jury could find on these facts that arcanum failed to use reasonable care,and that,had it been reasonably diligent,arcanum would have discovered that leifer was seeking the information for an improper purpose.see king crossland sav.bank,cir t he assessment of reasonableness generally is a factual question to be addressed by the jury.accordingly,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to arcanum.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we affirm the judgment of the district court to the extent it granted summary judgment in favor of softech international,and rodriguez,and we vacate the judgment to the extent it granted summary judgment in favor of arcanum investigations,and cohn on gordon claims under the dppa.we remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
insofar as the majority opinion superimposes a negligence duty of care on the civil damages remedy of the driver privacy protection act the act,i respectfully dissent.
an industry of resellers has arisen to facilitate acquisition by legitimate of information collected by state motor vehicle bureaus.the act is designed to reduce abuses of the information and invasions of privacy.at the same time,congress was careful to craft remedies for such abuse that would not impair the useful industry.see,protecting driver privacy hearing on before the subcomm.on civil and const.rights of the comm.on the judiciary,cong.statement of bill sponsor james moran careful consideration was given to the common uses now made of this information and great efforts were made to ensure that those uses were allowed under this bill,available at wl cong.rec.daily ed,statement of moran the act strikes a critical balance between an individual fundamental right to privacy and safety and the legitimate governmental and business needs for this information.the civil cause of action is worded in a way to target abuses without inflicting collateral damage on the industry itself a person who knowingly obtains,discloses or uses personal information,from a motor vehicle record,for a purpose not permitted under this chapter shall be liable to the individual to whom the information pertains,who may bring a civil action in a united states district court.emphasis added.
the majority opinion states that this language imposes a duty upon resellers to to make some inquiry before concluding that disclosure is permitted.op.at emphasis removed.i agree to the extent that resellers should require to specify a legitimate use and give them notice that misuse subjects them to liability.but it is undisputed that arcanum,the reseller here,did make such inquiry and provide such notice it required the customer to represent which legitimate purpose was being pursued it referenced the act and it elicited an indemnification in the event of a statutory violation all of which served to warn the customer that violation of the act would entail consequences.
so the real holding of the majority opinion is that these measures are not enough,and that resellers have a duty of inquiry to verify the identity of the customer,and to perform related investigations,as though selling a firearm or dispensing a narcotic.that is a negligence standard,and it is a judicial invention that alters the nature of the industry service and its economics,and thereby upsets the balance of the act.
