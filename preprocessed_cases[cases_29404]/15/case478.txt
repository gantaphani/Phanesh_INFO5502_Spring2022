daniel voelker appeals from the district court dismissal of his claims for breach of written warranty and breach of the implied warranty of merchantability under the warranty act,act or the act et,and for various violations of state law.we reverse as to voelker claim for breach of written warranty under the act and affirm as to all other claims.
because this case comes to us after the district court granted a motion to dismiss under.b,we assume that the facts alleged in the complaint are true.this dispute revolves around the lease of an automobile,a porsche,which ing.porsche ag porsche manufactured in germany.through its subsidiary,porsche cars north america,for our purposes,we shall refer to both entities as porsche,porsche exported the auto to the united states and sold it to copans motors,a porsche dealership located in pompano beach,florida,which then took title to the vehicle.in june,voelker leased the car from copans.as part of the lease agreement,porsche and copans provided voelker with a new car limited warranty which,with enumerated exceptions,required porsche to repair or replace any part that wa s defective in material or workmanship under normal use.by its own terms,this warranty was to begin on the date the car was first delivered to the first retail purchaser,or the date it wa s first used as a demonstrator,lease,or company car,whichever c ame first.
unfortunately for voelker,less than three months after the lease began,on september,walter dreikosen ran a stop sign and his vehicle collided with the porsche on the driver side,causing more than in damages and physical injuries to voelker.although the car had a driver side airbag system,it did not deploy.after the accident,the car was taken to europa imports for repairs.under the lease,only porsche parts could be used to fix the car.the parts voelker needed were in short supply,however,and his car sat in the shop for several months.at some point,stuck with a car he could neither drive nor repair,voelker stopped making payments to porsche financial services,pfs,the finance company to whom copans had assigned the lease.
voelker then complained to porsche.the customer commitment department of porsche responded by promising voelker that,until the repair parts were delivered to europa motors,it would make lease payments directly to pfs.in february,however,james ray,director of credit operations for pfs,told voelker that he would not accept payments from porsche because to do so would violate banking laws.although pfs did eventually accept two lease payments from porsche,ray stopped it from accepting any further payments.
in march,the car was still not fixed and pfs refused to pay for the repairs.pfs claimed that,because the parts were destroyed in an accident,and not defective,they were not covered by the warranty.it then demanded that voelker surrender the vehicle to be sold at auction,because of the overdue lease payments.
voelker responded by filing suit in the circuit court of cook county,illinois,alleging violations of three federal statutes,the truth in lending act tila,et,the fair credit reporting act fcra,et,and the act,as well as numerous claims under state law.the defendants then timely removed the case to the northern district of illinois,asserting in the notice of removal that the district court had original jurisdiction over the three federal claims and supplemental jurisdiction over the claims grounded in state law.voelker did not move to remand back to state court.eventually,on a rule b motion,the district court dismissed all of voelker federal claims and all but a few of voelker state claims.the district court then remanded the remaining state claims.voelker appeals the dismissal of his claims under the act,illinois uniform commercial code ucc ilcs,et,the new vehicle buyer protection act ilcs,et,a theory of fraudulent inducement,the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act ilcs,et,a theory of tortious interference with contract,and a theory of breach of contract.

claims under the act 
voelker claims breach of written warranty and breach of the implied warranty of merchantability against porsche and copans under the act.although the parties have not briefed the issue,it is not clear at the outset that these claims were removed properly and,accordingly,it is unclear that this court has subject matter jurisdiction over them.federal courts are obliged to inquire sua sponte wherever the propriety of the removal of a claim to federal court is in question.tylka gerber products,cir.our review of this issue is plenary.id.
removal is proper over any action that could have been filed originally in federal court.id.at.there are two conceivable ways in which voelker claims could originally have been brought in federal court under federal question jurisdiction or under supplemental jurisdiction.under d b,federal question jurisdiction exists over a claim where the amount in controversy is at least.ford motor,cir.in their notice of removal to federal court,d was the only basis that the defendants put forth to justify federal jurisdiction over the claims.to calculate the amount in controversy under d b,however,the party asserting federal jurisdiction must allege the cost of the replacement vehicle,minus both the present value of the allegedly defective vehicle and the value that the plaintiff received from the allegedly defective vehicle.id.at.unfortunately,no party has provided us with the relevant numbers to plug into the formula,and we are thus in no position to conclude that jurisdiction under d b existed over the claims.that leaves the question of whether federal jurisdiction over the claims could exist under the statute governing supplemental jurisdiction.
supplemental jurisdiction over the claims could have existed in the district court.that court had federal question jurisdiction over the tila and fcra claims and,because both of those claims and the claims arise from the same controversy,it also had the discretionary authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims.see a see also suber chrysler,cir holding that district courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims wetzel american motors,same.once we determine that the district court had the power to entertain,under its supplemental jurisdiction,a claim that it actually reached on the merits,the existence of federal jurisdiction over that claim is established and our review is limited to whether the district court discretion was abused.peter bay homeowners ass stillman,cir see also jass prudential health care plan,cir holding that federal jurisdiction existed for a claim over which the district court could have,but did not explicitly,invoke supplemental jurisdiction.given that neither party objects to the district court de facto exercise of its supplemental jurisdiction,and no exceptional circumstances exist,any possible issue of whether the district court abused its discretion by exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the claims is waived.new jersey turnpike auth.ppg,cir.
having concluded that we have jurisdiction to reach the issue,we turn to whether the district court properly dismissed voelker claims for breach of both written and implied warranties under the act.the statute allows a consumer to bring a suit where he claims to be damaged by the failure of a supplier,warrantor,or service contractor to comply with any obligation under this act or under a written warranty,implied warranty,or service contract.d.to proceed with his claim,therefore,voelker must be a consumer within the ambit of the statute.the district court dismissed voelker claims under the act on the ground that lessees are not consumers under the statute.thus the first question on appeal is whether voelker is a consumer for purposes of his claim for breach of written warranty.
the act defines three categories of consumer s a category one consumer is a buyer other than for the purposes of resale of any consumer product a category two consumer is any person to whom such product is transferred during the duration of an implied or written warranty or service contract applicable to the product and,a category three consumer is any other person who is entitled by the terms of such warranty or service contract or under applicable state law to enforce against the warrantor or service contractor the obligations of the warranty or service contract.voelker claims to be a consumer under all three categories.
the first category of consumer would require voelker to be a buyer,which presupposes a sale.the sale that voelker identifies in his brief is the lease,which he argues is functionally equivalent to a sale.no binding authority governs the question of whether a lease can constitute a sale under the act.persuasive authorities,for their part,are divided.see szubski,llc,ohio misc d,collecting cases on both sides of the issue.
as the court of appeals of new york has pointed out,the act does not define sale.dicintio daimlerchrysler.under the uniform commercial code,however,it is well established that a sale occurs only where there is a passing of title to a buyer.id.citing ucc and a.in common speech,similarly,a sale is typically understood to require the transfer of title.see webster ninth new collegiate dictionary defining sale,in relevant part,as the transfer of ownership of and title to property from one person to another for a price.against this backdrop,we conclude that no reasonable person reading the act would conclude that there is a sale to voelker under the act where title does not pass to him.see,dicintio,at sellers frank griffin amc jeep,so d.here,it is undisputed that title never passed to voelker under the lease agreement,and so the lease can not constitute a sale for purposes of making voelker a category one consumer.
when voelker signed his lease,however,title had already passed from the car manufacturer,porsche,to the lessor,copans.relying on cohen am general,d,voelker argues that the sale needed to qualify him as a category one consumer occurred when the manufacturer sold the vehicle to copans,who in turn became voelker lessor.we disagree because,for a sale to qualify a plaintiff as a category one consumer,it must be made to a buyer other than for purposes of resale.emphasis added.in other words,it is a final sale to a user,not a sale to an intended reseller.but whenever a lessor takes title to a car,at least one of its purposes is,presumably,the actual resale of the vehicle.dicintio,at.in this particular case,voelker lease,a copy of which is attached to the complaint,establishes that copans took title of the vehicle with intent ultimately to resell it paragraph gives voelker first option to buy the car at the end of the lease term or even before the end of the lease term,and paragraph requires voelker,in the event of a default,to reimburse the lessor for reasonable expenses incurred as a result of selling the car,presumably after repossessing it.see diamond porsche cars,c,wl,at,construing a very similar lease,vacated on other grounds.cir.
in short,for voelker to qualify as a category one consumer under the act,there must have been a sale of the automobile other than for the purposes of resale,and that sale must have included the transfer of title.here,the only sale alleged in relation to the car was between the manufacturer,porsche,and the lessor,copans,and that sale occurred for the purposes of resale.accordingly,accepting all facts alleged in the complaint as true,the transfer of the possession of the car to voelker was not a sale and thus he is not entitled to proceed under the act as a category one consumer.
the next question is whether voelker has stated a claim as a category two consumer.in other words,has voelker alleged facts that would show that he is any person to whom such product is transferred during the duration of an implied or written warranty or service contract applicable to the product emphasis added.the written warranty applicable to the product that voelker identifies is the new car limited warranty,which voelker has attached to his complaint.that warranty,however,did not begin until after possession of the car was transferred to voelker,and not during the warranty duration.by its own terms,the warranty did not take effect until one of four antecedents occurred the date the car was first delivered to the first retail purchaser,or the date it wa s first used as a demonstrator,lease,or company car,whichever c ame first.the only triggering event that voelker identifies is the date that the car was first a lease car.because the warranty did not begin until the date the car was first used as a lease car,the warranty did not begin until after he took possession.thus,voelker has failed to allege that the car was transferred to him during the duration of the new car limited warranty,and,accepting all of the allegations in his complaint as true,he does not qualify as a category two consumer 
finally,we consider whether voelker has stated a claim as a category three consumer.that is,we ask whether he is any other person who is entitled by the terms of such warranty or service contract or under applicable state law to enforce against the warrantor or service contractor the obligations of the warranty or service contract.emphasis added.copans,as the defendants assert,assigned to voelker all its rights under the porsche limited warranty.under the state law of illinois,as an assignee of that warranty,a lessee like voelker was entitled to enforce the rights arising from the warranty.dekelaita nissan motor,wl,at citing collins carboline.therefore,voelker qualifies as a category three consumer.see id.
the defendants nonetheless argue that,even if voelker satisfied the definition of consumer,because the only sale of the car was for purposes of resale,he does not have a written warranty as defined in the statute and therefore may not proceed with his claim for breach of written warranty.the act defines written warranty as follows 
the term written warranty means 
a any written affirmation of fact or written promise made in connection with the sale of a consumer product by a supplier to a buyer which relates to the nature of the material or workmanship and affirms or promises that such material or workmanship is defect free or will meet a specified level of performance over a specified period of time,or 
b any undertaking in writing in connection with the sale by a supplier of a consumer product to refund,repair,replace,or take other remedial action with respect to such product in the event that such product fails to meet the specifications set forth in the undertaking,
which written affirmation,promise,or undertaking becomes part of the basis of the bargain between a supplier and a buyer for purposes other than resale of such product.
emphasis added.having concluded above that the sale of the auto from porsche to copans was for the purpose of resale,we agree with the defendants that the new car limited warranty does not satisfy the statute definition of a written warranty because it was not made to a buyer for purposes other than resale.
for voelker to state a valid claim,however,the new car limited warranty need not meet the definition of written warranty contained in.because voelker is a category three consumer entitled under state law to enforce the new car limited warranty,he is a consumer allowed under the act to enforce the new car limited warranty.see including as consumers those entitled to enforce a warranty under applicable state law dekelaita,holding that the third prong does not exclusively require that the warranty meet the act definition if in fact it is enforceable under state law.
in short,because voelker,under the assignment from copans,is a person entitled to enforce the new car limited warranty under the applicable state law,we hold that voelker may proceed as a category three consumer regarding his claim for breach of written warranty under the act.
