determination of these penalties is governed by section,subdivision b and by section,subdivision b,which contain identical language the court shall impose a civil penalty for each violation of this chapter.in assessing the amount of the civil penalty,the court shall consider any one or more of the relevant circumstances presented by any of the parties to the case,including,but not limited to,the following the nature and seriousness of the misconduct,the number of violations,the persistence of the misconduct,the length of time over which the misconduct occurred,the willfulness of the defendant misconduct,and the defendant assets,liabilities,and net worth,subd.b and,subd.b,italics added.
application of usual principles of statutory interpretation supports conclusion that under sections and,the people do not have the burden of presenting evidence of a defendant financial condition.
under a plain reading of these penalty statutes,evidence of a defendant financial condition,although relevant,is not essential for determining the penalty.
when the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous,there is no need for statutory construction and courts should not indulge in it.california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,d.further,significance should be given,if possible,to every word of a statute,and a construction that renders a word surplusage should be avoided.delaney superior court cal d.
the term relevant circumstances is preceded by the phrase any one or more,subd.b,subd.b.thus,giving the statutes their ordinary meaning,a defendant financial condition is only one of at least six relevant factors a court may consider in determining an appropriate penalty,and the court is authorized to impose a penalty based on evidence as to any one or more of the enumerated factors.
further,the term relevant circumstances is followed by the phrase presented by any of the parties to the case,subd.b,subd.b.thus,these statutes do not require the people to present evidence of a defendant financial circumstances.the statutes also do not require a defendant to present evidence of financial condition.if neither party presents any evidence relating to financial condition or some other enumerated factor,the court is still required to impose civil penalties based upon other relevant evidence before the court.
duly giving significance to every word of the statutes,we conclude evidence of a defendant financial condition is merely one factor to be considered,such evidence may be presented by either party to the action,and the court is required to impose a penalty even in the absence of any evidence as to a defendant financial status.had the legislature intended to require evidence of a defendant financial status to be presented by the people as a prerequisite to the imposition of civil penalties under sections and,it would not have included the specific qualifying phrases any one or more of the relevant circumstances and presented by any of the parties to the case in subdivision b of the statutes.
case law pertaining to other statutory penalties is in accord.
