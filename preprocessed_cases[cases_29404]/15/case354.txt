margaret wike filed this lawsuit against vertrue and its subsidiary,adaptive marketing collectively,vertrue,claiming that vertrue violated federal law by enrolling her in a discount club and charging a monthly fee to her debit card.the district court granted summary judgment to vertrue on wike claim under the electronic funds transfer act efta,et,and it denied her leave to amend her complaint to add claims under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et.concluding that efta statute of limitations does not bar wike claim,we reverse.
on february,wike called america online aol to set up an account for a friend.at the end of the call,the aol representative told wike that she was eligible to claim a free gift card and,with wike permission,transferred wike call to another operator who would provide more details.that operator turned out to be a telemarketer for influent,which sold memberships in discount clubs and other programs for vertrue.
once connected with wike,the telemarketer confirmed wike name,address and telephone number and told her that,as a galleria member,she would receive a membership kit explaining how to claim her gift card.roa.yet galleria membership,the telemarketer explained,was not free wike would be billed that day and,after a trial period,would be billed each month thereafter,unless and until wike cancelled her membership.wike agreed,provided her visa number and declined an offer for a second discount club the telemarketer pitched.
wike claims she never received the promised membership kit which vertrue insists it sent,though she acknowledges she might have disregarded it as junk mail.nor did wike question the first charge for galleriausa on her march statement,mistakenly believing that it pertained to an unrelated purchase.roa.
when a second monthly charge showed up on april,it got wike attention.she called galleria support number several times over the ensuing months,asking that her membership be canceled and the monthly charges refunded.none of this received no refunds,and the monthly charges october,when wike canceled her account and received a partial refund.
wike filed this lawsuit against vertrue in march,alleging in addition to other claims not at issue in this appeal that vertrue marketing practices violated efta,et.the district court granted summary judgment for vertrue,concluding that efta limitations period barred wike claim.
wike sought leave to add rico claims to her complaint,alleging that vertrue had ensnared wike and hundreds of thousands of other consumers in a deceptive marketing scheme.roa.the district court denied wike request,concluding that the proposed amendment would be futile because wike could not show she was injured by reason of vertrue alleged racketeering activity,c.wike appeals both rulings.
wike first challenges the ruling.enacted in as an amendment to the consumer credit protection act,et,efta creates a framework of rights,liabilities,and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund transfer systems,id.a.the statute covers a wide range of electronic money atm withdrawals and payments to banking by subjects them to a litany of procedural requirements designed to protect consumers from transactions made in error or without their consent.see id.in addition to limiting a consumer liability for erroneous and unauthorized transfers,the statute authorizes aggrieved consumers to file actions,which when successful come with attorney fees.id.a.
wike claims that vertrue violated the statute restriction on preauthorized electronic fund transfer s,id,which may be permitted by consumers only in writing,a copy of which must be given to the consumer when made,id.a accord b see also id.pt.supp.i,b.vertrue did not comply with these requirements,wike says,when the telemarketer enrolled her in the galleria program it set up recurring charges to her visa debit card without obtaining her assent in writing having obtained consent over the phone and without giving her a copy of the writing there being no writing to give.
the question in this appeal,however,is not whether wike filed a valid efta claim it is whether she filed a timely one.consumers must file claims within one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation,g,and the question here is when the alleged violation occurred.the district court concluded that a violation of the rule occurs when the,all of the steps necessary to arrange a future transfer,even if no transfer has yet taken place,while wike argues that a violation occurs when the first transfer takes place.everyone agrees that the transfers from wike bank account were arranged on february,that the first recurring transfer occurred on march,and that wike filed her complaint on march.her complaint thus is timely if the date of the transfer,not the date vertrue arranged for the transfer,triggers the limitations clock.
as we see it,the limitations period began when the first recurring transfer took place,not when vertrue arranged it.several clues point to the moment of transfer as the pivotal event.first,the key provision speaks of preauthorized transfers,not efforts to arrange them.id.a.the same section also gives consumers who discover preplanned transfers before they happen a mechanism for stopping them.id.and beyond the special safeguards that apply only to preauthorized transfers,efta imposes several protections geared to ensuring that consumers learn about transfers from their bank accounts,understand their liability for such transfers and have ample opportunities to dispute and seek reimbursement for transactions they did not authorize.see id.
until the transfer takes place,indeed,nothing guarantees that it will happen or that the consumer will suffer any harm.an entity like vertrue could make a mistake while initiating a transfer with a consumer bank,or the bank might fail to execute the because it dropped the ball or,if it recognizes the transfer is unauthorized,because it sought to protect a customer.if the consumer learns of the transfer in time,he too can break the chain by ordering his bank to stop payment.id.a.we seriously doubt that vertrue or any other payee in its situation would concede an efta violation if any of these contingencies interrupted the process and prevented the transfer from occurring.because there is no assurance at the time a payee attempts to initiate a transfer that anything will come of it,there is good reason to think congress created a cause of action that accrues only when the reality of harm,not its mere possibility,takes is when transfers occur.id.
second,as a standard rule,the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action and thus can file suit and obtain relief.bay area laundry dry cleaning pension trust fund ferbar of,d internal quotation marks omitted.customarily,that is true when the defendant breaches a duty here a duty imposed by statute and the claimant is injured.here,vertrue violated a duty when it initiated the transfers,but wike was not injured until the first transfer occurred.a consumer is injured only if,and only when,funds are withdrawn from her account.wachtel west,cir holding that a violation of the truth in lending act disclosure requirements occurs,and the limitations clock starts,when a lender enters a credit contract with a borrower without making required disclosures,because the harm the borrower inability to compare meaningfully other lenders when the borrower becomes locked into a loan agreement.no doubt,congress may have authority in some settings to alter this standard rule and to create a limitations period that begins before a plaintiff has a cause of action,injury included.bay area laundry,at.but we hesitate to infer such an unusual outcome absent some clear indication in the statute,see,and efta contains no such indication.
third,the practicalities of these transactions support this interpretation.how can a consumer learn of a noncompliant know that the time for protecting her rights is the transfer takes place say a telemarketer sets up a string of recurring future transfers from a consumer to itself and does so without obtaining the con
