plaintiff john trinkle appeals from the judgment entered following the granting of defendant california state lottery csl motion for summary judgment and denying trinkle for summary judgment.
in his complaint and for summary adjudication,trinkle sought declaratory relief to determine whether the csl use of electronic vending machines to dispense scratchers lottery tickets is an illegal use of slot machines.the superior court found the scratchers vending machines svm are not illegal slot machines.
on appeal,trinkle challenges this ruling.we find no error and affirm the judgment.
factual background 
the parties stipulated to the following description of the svm the vending machines used to dispense lottery tickets in csl scratchers games are electromechanical devices for dispensing scratchers lottery tickets.each vending machine consists of a cabinet containing a number of bins into which a stock of scratchers tickets may be loaded into each bin.a minimum of or tickets may be loaded in each bin,depending upon the price of the scratchers ticket in the game loaded in that bin.each bin may contain a separate scratchers game,or more than one bin may be loaded with tickets for the same scratchers game.
scratchers tickets in each bin are threaded from the top of the stack through an opening in the cabinet at the bottom of each bin,from which they may be retrieved by the purchaser.the path to that opening causes the tickets to pass in front of a window in the front of each bin,such that the face of the scratchers tickets is visible to the purchaser in this way,the purchaser may know which scratchers game is being dispensed in each bin.a purchaser does not know whether any scratchers ticket visible in the window is a winning ticket.
the cost of each scratchers ticket is,or,depending upon the game.a person desiring to purchase a scratchers ticket using a vending machine inserts a,or bill into a bill acceptor that is installed in the cabinet.the svm do not give change,and customers are so advised by a sign on the face of the cabinet.each svm has a locked cash compartment that holds a minimum of bills.
a customer may elect to purchase the ticket from one or another of the bins by pushing a button in front of the window for that bin.the tickets are dispensed sequentially,according to the order in which they were loaded into the svm bin.nothing about the machine or its operation by the customer alters the order in which the tickets were arranged at the time they were printed.once dispensed,the purchaser separates the ticket from the tickets remaining in the bin by tearing the ticket at its perforation.
the purchaser of the ticket s determines whether he or she has won a prize by scratching off the substance covering the symbol on the ticket s.depending upon the size of the prize awarded,the purchaser may redeem a winning ticket at the retail outlet where it was purchased or the ticket may be sent to the csl for validation and redemption.
no svm includes the whole of a scratchers game.tickets for any scratchers game are distributed for sale in various locations throughout california.in any scratchers game,tickets may be sold by svm as well as by other means,including hand delivery from a retail clerk.winning scratchers tickets may award the holder a fixed sum of money or a chance in the big spin draw.every scratchers game has a predetermined number of winning tickets distributed throughout the deal.
the stock of tickets loaded into any bin of an svm may include one or more tickets awarding varying prizes.each scratchers ticket is covered with an opaque substance making it impossible for a customer to know whether any ticket that is visible in the window of an svm is a winning ticket.
it is also undisputed by the parties that each ticket issued in a scratchers game bears a unique number distinguishing it from every other ticket in that game.by the time a scratchers ticket is ready to be loaded into an svm,or sold by a human sales clerk,it has already been subjected to the only random selection process involved in a scratchers game.at the time a pack of scratchers tickets is loaded into an svm,every ticket affords the purchaser an opportunity to win that is equal to that of every other ticket purchased in that particular game.once loaded,and barring machine malfunction,each svm dispenses a paper scratchers ticket and each ticket provides the purchaser with an opportunity to win a prize in a scratchers lottery game.
the svm do not have,and are not linked with,any computer program that generates random numbers or symbols.the svms also do not have any other kind of mechanism or device that is capable of conducting a process of random selection or any other kind of chance selection in or by the machines.nor do the svms dispense coins or currency or any tangible thing other than a scratchers ticket.
discussion 
trinkle contends the svms used by the csl are unlawful slot machines under penal code sections and.the csl contends the svms are ticket vending machines that only dispense lawful lottery tickets to the purchaser.
we agree with the csl.the mere use of electronic vending machines to dispense lottery tickets does not transform the lawful sale of lottery tickets into an unlawful use of slot machines,where as here,the machines inject no additional element of chance into the determination or distribution of the winning lottery ticket.
standard of review 
the question whether an svm is a slot machine as defined by statute is a question of law to be determined de novo by the reviewing court.western telcon,california state lottery cal th,d,western telcon trinkle stroh th,d trinkle bell gardens bicycle club of justice th,d.
constitutional and statutory authority 
state law prohibited all lotteries prior to cal,art.iv,subd.a,when the voters approved an initiative measure proposition,approved november,known as the california state lottery act of the lottery act or act.the act amended the california constitution,authorizing the establishment of a state lottery while prohibiting casinos of the type currently operating in nevada and new jersey.cal,art.iv,subds.d and e.
additionally,the lottery act added provisions to the government code,et which created the state lottery commission and empowered the commission to operate the lottery.horan state of california d.see,et the act defines a lottery game as any procedure authorized by the commission whereby prizes are distributed among persons who have paid,or who have unconditionally agreed to pay,for tickets or shares which provide the opportunity to win those prizes.penal code section similarly defines lottery.western telcon,supra,cal th at,d.the elements of a lottery are a prize,which is distributed by chance,and consideration paid for the opportunity to win the prize.cal.gas.retailers regal petroleum cal d.
the constitutional and statutory grant of authority to csl is limited to lotteries.the csl may not conduct games other than lotteries.western telcon,supra,cal th at,d.the distinction between lotteries and other forms of gambling is therefore crucial,and california law has long distinguished between lotteries and other forms of illegal gambling,treating gaming,betting,and lotteries as separate and distinct things in law and fact.western telcon,supra,cal th at,d,quoting people postma d supp.
gaming may be defined as the playing of any game for stakes hazarded by the players.a lottery may be defined as a distribution of prizes by lot or chance.betting may be defined as promise s to give money or money worth upon the determination of an uncertain or unascertained event in a particular way,and unlike a lottery may involve skill or judgment.id.at,d,quoting blakey,gaming,lotteries,and wagering the roots of the law of gambling rutgers,fn.
while some banked games resemble some forms of lottery,these two categories of gambling are mutually exclusive of one another,distinguishable not by the manner of play,but by the nature of the betting itself.western telcon,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis omitted.in a lottery the operator does not bet against any of the participants,but merely offers up a prize for distribution to one or more of them.the operator,in other words,has no interest in the outcome of the chance event that determines the winner or game or draw because neither the fact the prize will be disposed of,nor the value of the prize to be distributed,depends upon which,or how many,of the lottery entrants might win it.in a banking game,in contrast,the operator does compete with the other participants he is the one against the many.id.at,d,quoting people ambrose d supp.thus,in a lottery,the operator distributes the prize or prizes to the winner or winners,while in a banked gambling game,the operator pays off all winning wagers and keeps all losing wagers.western telcon,supra,cal th at,d.
c.the game of scratchers is a lottery 
trinkle concedes the game of scratchers is a lottery and does not challenge the sale of scratchers tickets by retail clerks.however,the question whether the game of scratchers is a lottery is a necessary predicate determination to the question whether the use of svms to sell scratchers tickets transforms the sale of lottery tickets into an unlawful use of a slot machine.we therefore consider the predicate question.
in western telcon,supra,cal th at page,d,the supreme court rejected the claim that csl scratchers games are necessarily banking games.the court stated that an instant game is not a banking game,but a straightforward form of lottery,if it has the following characteristics all tickets are,when sold,either winning or losing tickets nothing in the manner of play,that is,determines whether the tickets buyer wins or loses and all tickets printed for the game are sold the game does not end,that is,until all tickets have been sold.under these conditions,the operator knows in advance of play how much revenue will be produced and how much will be paid out in prizes.the operator thus has no interest in who buys a winning ticket and who a losing ticket,and does not wager against any of the ticket buyers.such a scheme would be a lottery,not a banking game,fn.omitted.without determining whether any or all of csl scratchers games met these criteria,the supreme court commented that an instant game may be a lottery under the traditional legal definition in penal code section.id.at,fn,d,orig.emphasis.
in a formal written opinion,the attorney general considered the question left open by the supreme court,concluding that scratchers games,which include a variety of instant ticket games are legal lottery games.applying the criteria set forth in western telcon,supra,cal th at page,d,the attorney general reasoned,the first condition is met since the manner of play does not determine whether the ticket buyer wins or loses.each ticket is a winning or losing ticket when sold.as for the second criterion,csl conducts the games so that,to the extent reasonably possible,all tickets printed for the game are sold each game does not end until all tickets have been sold.csl thus knows in advance of play how much revenue will be produced and how much will be paid out in prizes.accordingly,csl does not have an interest in who buys a winning ticket and the state lottery does not wager against the ticket buyers.scratchers is a legal lottery.id.at.
the undisputed facts in the record before us confirm the attorney general analysis.every scratchers game has a predetermined number of winning tickets distributed throughout the deal and determined prior to distribution and sale.the winning tickets are randomly printed with the winning symbol which distinguishes them from every other ticket in that game and definitively determines whether or not the ultimate ticket holder will win a prize.at the time of manufacture,an opaque coating is applied to the ticket,concealing the winning symbol until the ticket is purchased and scratched off by the purchaser.the winning ticket,along with all other tickets,are placed in a fixed sequence and distributed for sale in various locations throughout california.nothing in the manner of play determines whether the ticket buyer wins or loses and the operator,namely csl,has no interest in who buys a winning or losing ticket.we therefore conclude the game of scratchers is a lottery.
we now address the question tendered for our determination,whether the mere use of a vending machine by csl to dispense lottery tickets transforms the lawful sale of a scratchers ticket into an unlawful use of a slot machine.we think the answer is clear,it does not.
svm are not slot machines 
the use or possession of a slot machine is prohibited by penal code section which defines a slot machine in pertinent part as any device that is adapted for use in such a way that,as a result of the insertion of any piece of money or coin or other object such machine or device is caused to operate or may be operated,and by reason of any element of hazard or chance or of other outcome of such operation unpredictable by him,the user may receive or become entitled to receive any thing of value,subd.penal code section similarly defines a slot machine 
thus,the elements of a slot machine are the insertion of money or other object which causes the machine to operate,the operation of the machine is unpredictable and governed by chance,and by reason of the chance operation of the machine,the user may become entitled to receive a thing of value.
relying on people ex rel.lockyer pacific gaming technologies th,d pacific gaming technologies,trinkle contends the svms are slot machines because they meet all elements of a slot machine,namely that by the insertion of money and purely by chance,the user may receive or become entitled to receive money.csl contends the svms are not slot machines because they do not affect the element of chance which is fixed when the tickets are printed,grouped in bins,and distributed,some of which are loaded into the svms.we agree with csl.trinkle analysis ignores the statutory language.
in construing statutory language,the courts should give meaning to every word of a statute and avoid a construction making any word surplusage.reno baird cal th,d.with respect to the element of chance,penal code section states,by reason of any element of hazard or chance or of other outcome of such operation unpredictable by him by using the words such operation,the legislature linked the element of chance to the operation of the machine,requiring that the machine itself determine the element of chance and become the object of play.
without the element of chance incorporated into the operation of the machine,the machine is nothing more than a vending machine which dispenses merchandise for consideration.people kay,d supp,trinkle,supra,th at,d once the elements of chance and prize are added to a vending machine,the consideration paid from the perspective is no longer solely for the product.pacific gaming technologies,supra,th at,d.thus,in both trinkle and pacific gaming technologies,the machines in question were found to be slot machines under penal code section because the outcome was dependent upon the element of chance that was generated by the machines themselves.
indeed,a review of the history of slot machines discloses that vending machines used to dispense candy,fortunes,music,and other forms of consideration,were converted into gambling devices by adding the element of chance to the operation of the machine and the promise of cash payouts.rychlak,video gambling devices ucla.these machines were referred to as slot machines.as noted by one commentator,known as a bandit clearly exhibited all three elements of gambling the coin inserted by the player amounted to consideration,the spinning wheels rendered a result based on chance,and the winning gambler received a reward when coins fell into the receptacle.id.at.while the technology of the slot machines may differ from the modern slot machines,the elements of gambling remain the same.the operation of the device the spinning wheels or a computer program renders the chance result.
applying these principles to the operation of the svm,we conclude these machines are not illegal slot machines within the meaning of penal code section the scratchers tickets are printed with symbols that definitively determine whether the ultimate tic
