factual and procedural history 
jackson hewitt,jackson hewitt and its affiliates,cendant corporation and tax services of america market tax preparation services to consumers many low income taxpayers who receive the earned income tax credit seek assistance preparing their returns from tax preparation services.with santa barbara,jackson hewitt and its affiliates offer ral and similar products to low income taxpayers and other consumers.
an ral is a loan secured by a consumer expected tax refund.when a lender accepts an ral application,it establishes a bank account to receive the tax refund.the ral applicant signs documents authorizing the irs to deposit the applicant tax refund in that account.if the applicant tax refund is less than expected,or is not deposited,the bank holds the consumer liable for any outstanding ral balance including outstanding balances that the applicant may owe to other specified lenders for ral issued in prior years,plus late fees.in,santa barbara charged an annual percentage rate ranging from to percent for ral.
banks making ral,including santa barbara and respondent household bank,participate in agreements with other banks to collect outstanding ral debts from ral customers agreements.ral lenders include a provision in ral applications to implement the agreement provision.
appellant hood is a taxpayer who received the earned income tax credit for several years.on january,hood went to a jackson hewitt office for tax preparation service.a jackson hewitt employee told hood that she had two options for a quick rapid refund that she could receive the next day,or another refund that would be payable within hours.the jackson hewitt employee did not explain that these options were loans.hood selected the option for payment within hours.
after preparing hood tax returns,the jackson hewitt employee instructed hood to sign and initial a set of documents.hood did not have an opportunity to read those documents,including a santa barbara bank trust refund anticipation loan application and agreement ral application.the jackson hewitt employee did not inform hood that the ral application contained a provision allowing santa barbara to seize her anticipated tax refund if she had any prior outstanding ral debts payable to other ral lenders.
the ral application consists of four pages,each containing two columns of very fine text.the provision appears as section,at the bottom of the second page of the ral application,as follows 
collection of delinquent ral.you authorize jhi jackson hewitt and sbbt santa barbara to exchange information about your current and prior rals with other ral lenders including bank one,beneficial national bank,first security bank,river city bank,county bank of rehoboth beach,de and republic bank trust now.if you have delinquent rals from prior years with sbbt or any one or more of these lenders that have not been discharged in bankruptcy,you will not be eligible for a ral but will instead receive an acr accelerated check refund.upon receipt of your tax refund,you authorize sbbt to deduct from the account,after deducting the applicable fees as set forth in section above,the total amount due on the prior year rals and forward such amount to the appropriate ral lender s prior to disbursing the balance of the account to you.
the provision is referenced elsewhere in the ral application,for example,as amounts due pursuant to section or as the collection authorizations in section.this provision implements agreements whereby participating banks collect each others ral debts by seizing the tax refunds of taxpayers who apply for ral or similar products.
in signing the ral application,the applicant acknowledges having read,understood,and agreed to each of its terms and conditions and having consented to the collection authorizations in section.the applicant also assigns his or her federal income tax refund and a ccount,and all funds deposited therein,to the extent necessary to reimburse santa barbara for any other amounts pursuant to this ral application.in addition,the applicant certifies having read all documents relating to the ral application.ral application,sections.
santa barbara sent hood a letter dated february,stating that her ral was denied because santa barbara had been informed of an outstanding ral debt with household bank.santa barbara letter stated that hood tax refund would be used to satisfy the household bank ral debt and that santa barbara would send hood any funds remaining after the household bank ral debt was satisfied.
hood did not receive her tax refund.nor did she receive the accelerated check refund described in the ral application as an alternative product for applicants who were ineligible for ral.without her tax refund,hood could not pay her rent and she received an eviction notice.hood and other class members suffered substantial economic losses as a result of the seizure of their tax refunds.
appellants filed an amended class action complaint seeking damages and other relief for the tort of conversion,and under the ucl,the clra and the rosenthal fair debt collection practices act.respondents filed demurrers to appellants third amended complaint.the trial court overruled the demurrers to the third amended complaint except as to one cause of action against jackson hewitt and another cause of action against cendant corporation and tax services of america.
after the court overruled respondents demurrers,santa barbara filed a seeking indemnity from other agreement participants household bank,beneficial national bank household tax masters,bank one,ohio first bank of delaware republic first bank first security bank of mackinaw,illinois republic bank trust company river city bank.santa barbara and the filed motions for judgment on the pleadings or,in the alternative,for summary adjudication,based on the affirmative defense of preemption.because the trial court had issued orders limiting discovery,appellants opposed the motion for summary adjudication as premature while substantively opposing the motion for judgment on the pleadings.the trial court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the regulations of the office of the comptroller of the currency occ expressly preempted appellants state law causes of action.
discussion 
the trial court concluded that appellants claims were expressly preempted by provisions of the occ visitorial powers regulation a regulation b ii,iv,and estate lending regulation d ii.the trial court did not decide whether appellants claims were also barred by the provisions in the occ regulations that preempt state laws that obstruct,impair,or condition a national bank ability to fully exercise its federally authorized powers b,or estate lending powers d,or any other federally authorized powers a.the trial court consequently did not consider the evidence that respondent banks offered to show that the application of state law to the ral lending program would more than incidentally affect the exercise of their federally authorized powers

general principles of preemption 
congress has the authority to preempt state law by virtue of the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,which provides that laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.washington mutual bank superior court,supra,th at,d,citing smiley citibank cal th,d.three forms of preemption may occur express preemption where congress expressly specifies that its enactment preempts state law field preemption where the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive that there is a reasonable inference congress intended to dominate the field and state laws on the same subject are precluded and conflict preemption where federal law actually conflicts with state law and it is impossible for a private party to comply with both requirements.smith wells fargo bank,th,d smith,review den,citing monarch southern pacific transportation th,d.
federal regulations may preempt state law just as fully as federal statutes.citation.an agency may preempt state law through regulations that are within the scope of its statutory authority and that are not arbitrary.smith,supra,th at,fn,d,citing washington mutual bank superior court,supra,th at,d,and other authorities.
in determining whether a federal statute or regulation preempts a state law,we begin with the general presumption that under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution a federal statute or regulation does not preempt a state historic police powers unless preemption is a clear and manifest purpose of the united states congress,art.vi,cl.cipollone liggett group,d.smith,supra,th at,d.the states historic police powers include the regulation of consumer protection in general and of the banking and insurance industries in particular.see also mcclellan chipman.peatros bank of america cal th,d,national state bank,elizabeth,long cir,banking is an area traditionally subject to dual federal and state control.
there is a general presumption against preemption unless the state regulates in an area where there has been a significant federal presence.smith,supra,th at,d united states locke,d.in bank of america city county of san francisco cir,cities sought to regulate banks with ordinances to prohibit charging atm fees to.in that context,the ninth circuit declined to apply the general presumption against preemption because the field of banking is an area where there has been a significant federal presence.see also barnett bank nelson,d federal statute authorizing national banks to sell insurance in small towns preempted a conflicting florida law that forbid such sales.
in the recent smith case,the claims did not involve state or local laws that targeted banks or sought to regulate banking.in that context,the court imposed the burden of showing that specific state law claims were preempted on the party claiming preemption because preemption of state laws by federal law or regulation generally is not favored.smith,supra,th at,d.the smith court therefore narrowly construe d the precise language of the federal regulation to determine whether a particular state law claim was preempted.citations.as to each state law claim,the central inquiry was whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the claim constitute d a requirement or prohibition of the sort that federal law expressly preempt d.id.at,d.like the smith court,we narrowly construe the occ regulations to determine whether appellants claims are preempted.
federal banking laws and regulations 
the national bank act nba grants national banking associations,santa barbara and other bank respondents all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking by receiving deposits and making loans.as the administrator charged with supervision of the nba citations,the occ bears primary responsibility for surveillance of the business of banking authorized by title united states code section seventh.nationsbank variable annuity,d.
in january,the occ published a final rule amending part of its regulations to add provisions clarifying the applicability of state law to national banks operations.the provisions concerning preemption identify the types of state laws that are preempted,as well as the types of state laws that generally are not preempted,with respect to national banks lending,and other operations.the trial court concluded that three of these regulations the visitorial powers,and regulations,which became effective february,expressly preempted appellants claims.
the visitorial powers regulation provides that s tate officials may not exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law.a.visitorial powers include conducting examinations and inspections of national bank records and prosecuting enforcement actions.a.
the regulation and the regulation have parallel provisions.for example,each regulation provides that,except where made applicable by federal law,state laws that obstruct,impair,or condition a national bank ability to fully exercise its federally authorized or powers are not applicable to national banks.b,d.
the regulation also provides that a national bank may exercise its powers without regard to state law limitations concerning disclosure requirements.b iii.similarly,the regulation provides that a national bank may make estate loans without regard to state law limitations concerning the ability of a creditor to require risk mitigants,in furtherance of safe and sound banking practices t he terms of credit s ecurity property,including leaseholds and d isclosure and advertising.d ii,iv,vi,viii.
both the regulation and the estate lending regulation save or exempt certain state laws including contracts,tort,and debt collection laws from preemption.these exemptions apply to the extent that such laws only incidentally affect the exercise of national banks or estate lending powers or are otherwise consistent with the banks or estate lending powers.see c,e.these exemptions are sometimes called savings clauses or provisions 
appellants state law claims 
the proposed plaintiff class is composed of all persons who at any time from march,forward,will have or have had their tax refunds seized by santa barbara as a result of the ral procedures and collection methods challenged in the complaint.appellants bring the class action as private attorneys general pursuant to the ucl,seeking a declaration that santa barbara seizure of refunds for debt collection purposes without consumers voluntary and knowing consent,and the contract provision permitting such debt collection are unlawful,unfair,deceptive and unenforceable.appellants also seek orders enjoining santa barbara from such seizure of refunds and from engaging in an unlawful,unfair,deceptive and unfair debt collection practice.bus.
a.the rosenthal fair debt collection practices act claims 
appellants allege that respondents violated the rosenthal fair debt collection practices act by failing to inform consumers that santa barbara would engage in debt collection practices during the loan application and approval process and by falsely representing the nature of their services and failing to include certain legally mandated debt collection notices,et,subd.i.appellants seek actual damages,penalty damages of at least per violation,and fees,costs,and expenses,subd.c.
b.the clra claims 
appellants seek injunctive relief and damages pursuant to the clra,et,which they allege respondents violated by representing that ral are a form of tax refund when they are loans subject to seizure by the lender to pay off alleged prior ral debts of individual taxpayers,subd.a.appellants also allege that respondents violated the clra by representing that they have rights and remedies that are prohibited by law,the right to collect a third party debt without providing notices required by law.in addition,appellants allege that respondents violated the clra by including the,unlawful,unfair,fraudulent and unconscionable debt collection provision provision in their ral application and that the ral application is an adhesion contract which is offered on a basis,subd.a.appellants further allege that the provision substantially deprives them and other consumers of their tax refunds without their voluntary,knowing,and intelligent consent,and that it consequently is unlawful,unfair,fraudulent,and unconscionable.appellants seek actual and punitive damages against santa barbara pursuant to civil code sections and,as well as injunctive relief,restitution,costs.
c.the ucl claim 
appellants seek injunctive relief,restitution,and monetary damages under the ucl because respondents practice violates the rosenthal fair debt collection practices act,the clra,offends public policy,is unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent,as well as unconscionable,oppressive,and unscrupulous.bus.appellants further allege that respondents deceive and mislead consumers by inducing them to sign ral agreements containing the provision because consumers are not clearly and effectively informed about the existence and effect of that provision.bus,et appellants causes of action under the ucl and the clra are based on the same predicate acts.
d.the conversion claim 
hood and similarly situated class members seek actual and punitive damages from santa barbara for conversion,alleging that respondents had no valid contract with these class members because they rejected their ral applications and did not give them any accelerated check refunds.
the trial court incorrectly concluded that federal regulations preempted appellants claims 
the visitorial powers doctrine does not preempt appellants claims because private parties actions are not visitations 
the trial court concluded that appellants sought state court regulation and supervision of the exercise of national banking powers.it further concluded that the visitorial powers doctrine precludes appellants claims that are brought on behalf of a class or the general public,citing title united states code section a and section a.we disagree.
the visitorial powers doctrine applies to government actions.that doctrine provides that no national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by federal law,vested in the courts of justice or such as shall be,or have been exercised or directed by congress a.visitorial powers include regulating and supervising activities permitted pursuant to federal banking law,examinations and inspections of bank records and enforcing compliance with any applicable federal or state laws concerning those activities.a.
historically,the visitations prohibited by the visitorial powers doctrine involve the act of a government.see,guthrie harkness.which describes the right of visitation as a public right,existing in the state for the purpose of examining the conduct of the corporation.because visitation assumes the act of a sovereign body,private actions brought by individuals against banks in pursuit of personal claims ordinarily are outside the scope of visitorial powers rules,fn,occ final rule action,bank activities and operations.the language of the occ visitorial powers regulation explicitly contemplates state action state officials may not exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law.a.
appellants brought their action as private parties seeking damages for financial losses as well as declaratory and injunctive relief under the private attorneys general statute.as the california supreme court recognized in people pacific land research cal d,there are fundamental differences between an action filed by a public prosecutor seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties and a consumer class action filed by a private party.see also payne national collection systems,th,d.the filing of a ucl class action by a private plaintiff does not confer on that plaintiff the stature of a prosecuting officer,and the fact that the plaintiff may be acting as a private attorney general is irrelevant,superior court th,d.the attorney general only role in this action has been the filing of an amicus brief with this court.actions brought by private plaintiffs are outside the scope of the visitorial powers regulation.
in discussing visitorial powers,the trial court concluded that appellants action is fundamentally regulatory.t he purpose of appellants action is to regulate agreements,not to adjudicate an individual dispute.we do not agree that by permitting appellants claims to proceed,the state is regulating santa barbara conduct.appellants ability to sue respondents under the ucl,under the clra,for conversion,and for violating debt collection laws does not interfere with what respondents may do or how they may operate their banking business.put another way,while the state can not dictate to respondents how they can or can not operate,it can insist that,however respondents choose to operate,they do so without violating debt collection laws and using deceptive business practices.see fenning glenfed,th,d.
appellants seek not only declaratory and injunctive relief but also the recovery of damages for class members under several theories.appellants allege class members suffered substantial economic losses as a result of respondents seizures of their tax refunds.the visitorial powers doctrine does not preclude appellants from pursuing their claims 
the occ and lending regulations do not preempt state tort,contract,or debt collection laws unless these laws more than incidentally affect the exercise of the banks authorized powers 
both the regulation and the lending regulation exempt or save state contract,tort,and debt collection laws from preemption.these exemptions apply to the extent that such laws only incidentally affect the exercise of national banks or estate lending powers or are otherwise consistent with the banks or estate lending powers.see c,e.based on the record before us,it does not appear that the state contract,tort or debt collection laws have more than an incidental effect on the exercise of national banks or estate lending powers or are otherwise inconsistent with the banks or estate lending powers 
california debt collection law,the rosenthal fair debt collection practices act,does not have more than an incidental effect on respondents.federal courts recognize that national banks and federally regulated thrift organizations are subject to state laws governing debt collection.see bank of america city county of san francisco,supra,at alkan citimortgage,d.s tates retain some power to regulate national banks in areas such as contracts,debt collection,acquisition and transfer of property,and taxation,zoning,criminal,and tort law.wells fargo bank boutris cir.appellants claims seeking relief under state contract,tort or debt collection are not preempted by federal law.
the and estate lending regulations do not preempt claims that are based on federally grounded obligations 
in smith,supra,th,d,the court held that the occ regulation did not preempt smith ucl or clra causes of action,which were partially based on wells fargo violation of federal law specifically,the occ disclosure regulations.because smith ucl cause of action was not based on an alleged violation of a state law requiring or limiting certain disclosures by wells fargo,the court concluded that it was not preempted by the regulation.id.at,d.
some of the legal obligations that appellants seek to enforce are created by federal law.appellants seek to redress the violation of federal standards that have been adopted as part of california law.for example,appellants allege that respondents violated civil code section,part of the rosenthal fair debt collection practices act,which requires debt collectors to comply with the federal fair debt collection practices act.in addition,title,united states code section e prohibits depository institutions from making any advertisement,announcement,or solicitation relating to a deposit account that is inaccurate or misleading or that misrepresents its deposit contracts.appellants allege that d efendants deceive and mislead consumers when they induce consumers to sign ral agreements containing the provision that defendants have violated civil code section,subdivision a because they have represented that the ral are a form of tax refund when they are loans subject to seizure by the lender to pay off alleged prior ral debts of individual taxpayers and that they have violated civil code section,subdivision a by representing that they have rights and remedies that are prohibited by law.the facts alleged in the complaint support a legal theory of liability for false and misleading advertising based on the predicate act s of violation of federal law regarding required disclosures and prohibited misleading or misrepresentative advertising.see smith,supra,th at,d.further,title,united states code section provides that a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.the complaint alleged facts would support a legal theory of liability for violation of section also.
an act or practice is unfair competition under the ucl if it is forbidden by law.smith,supra,th at,d.the ucl borrows violations of other laws,including federal laws,and makes them actionable as unlawful business practices.see id.at,d and authorities cited therein.therefore,a violation of federal law may serve as a predicate for a ucl action.ibid.the occ has recognized that the ucl applies to national banks 
the smith court concluded that smith ucl cause of action only incidentally affect ed the bank powers because smith ucl cause of action in effect was a tort cause of action based on alleged violations of federal disclosure requirements applicable to bank regardless of the ucl.smith,supra,th at,d.the court further reasoned that it could not be reasonably or persuasively,argued that smith ucl cause of action based on alleged violations of occ disclosure requirements involves a state law that obstruct s,impair s,or condition s the bank ability to fully exercise its powers,citing b.the court applied similar reasoning to smith clra cause of action and concluded that neither his ucl nor his clra causes of action were preempted.id.at,d.
state laws redressing violations of federal law are not preempted even where those laws offer additional remedies.see,medtronic,lohr,d.the federal fair debt collection practices act expressly protects from preemption state laws that provide greater consumer protection than does the federal law.ordinarily,state causes of action are not solely because they impose liability over and above that authorized by federal law.washington mutual bank superior court th,d.
the relevant occ regulations preempt those state laws that obstruct,impair,or condition a national bank ability to exercise its federally authorized and lending powers.b,d.here,appellants clra,ucl,and rosenthal fair debt collection practices act causes of action allege facts that would support a cause of action based on violations of federal law that apply to respondents regardless of state law.thus,those causes of action are not preempted because they do not impose any substantial limitations upon,or obstruct,impair,or condition a bank actions.see smith,supra,th at,d.
the occ estate lending regulation does not authorize banks to require mitigants to protect third party creditors from risk 
the trial court ruled that the national banks ability to require contracts as a risk mitigant or term of ral credit was expressly preempted from state regulation and laws,in apparent reliance on section d ii and iv.respondents describe this section as a primary ground of the trial court ruling.
the trial court ruling gave an expansive interpretation to the risk mitigants permissible under the occ estate lending regulation.the ruling enforced a risk mitigant or term of credit against hood and in favor of respondents,including santa barbara,in a transaction where santa barbara extended no credit to hood.santa barbara seizure of hood tax refund alleviated a risk incurred by a third party household bank under a preexisting transaction.the trial court thus applied the estate lending regulation to a transaction where santa barbara made no loan and incurred no risk.
we disagree with the trial court expansive reading of the estate lending regulation.as we have already indicated,we narrowly construe the precise language of the regulation.smith,supra,th at,d.the mitigation of risks of third parties is beyond the scope of the estate lending regulation.that regulation encompasses a bank lender mitigation of its own risk with respect to its extension of credit to an individual borrower.the regulation refers to a bank,a borrower ability to repay b,italics added,and a national bank authority to make loans without regard to state law limitations concerning t he ability of a creditor to require risk mitigants,or terms of credit.d ii,italics added.this language does not expressly preempt state laws where banks use loan applications to seize consumers tax refunds for the purpose of collecting the consumers preexisting debts to third parties.appellants claims are outside the scope of preemption encompassed by the estate lending regulation.see gibson world savings loan,supra,th at,d,citing cipollone liggett group,supra,at.
the estate lending regulation does not preempt claims of class members who received no loans 
hood and similarly situated class members received no loans from santa barbara.respondents nevertheless argue that the occ estate lending regulations preempt their claims.we disagree.santa barbara has no lending relationship with appellants.consequently,their claims against santa barbara and the laws upon which they base those claims are outside the scope of the estate lending regulation.
in addition,respondents argue that established principles of administrative law require this court to defer to the occ finding that national banks may participate in ral programs,and that to reach a contrary result would directly obstruct the occ regulatory authority,in violation of longstanding preemption principles.in so arguing,respondents cite chevron natural res.def.council,d,and arkansas oklahoma,d.respondents also cite recent federal appellate court decisions that uphold the occ preemp
