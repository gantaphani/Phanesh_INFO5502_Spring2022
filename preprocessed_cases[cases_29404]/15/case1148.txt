common facts 
in the consolidated appeals,the appellate court held that the act precluded binding arbitration of the consumer disputes.d at.the court reasoned that congress intended to preserve a judicial forum for consumers.d at.gateway limited warranty agreement,with its binding arbitration clause,violated the act and was therefore unenforceable.d at.accordingly,the court affirmed the decisions of the circuit court denying gateway motion to dismiss and compel arbitration.
we granted gateway petition for leave to appeal.we allowed the chamber of commerce of the united states of america and the consumer electronics association to file an amicus curiae brief in support of gateway.we also allowed the national association of securities and commercial law attorneys to file an amicus curiae brief in support of the plaintiffs.
standard of review 
as noted above,gateway filed a motion to dismiss borowiec complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and to compel arbitration pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.see ilcs west.in the actions initiated by waldron and the kobiks,gateway filed motions to dismiss and to compel arbitration pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.see ilcs west.a section motion to dismiss attacks the legal sufficiency of the complaint.illinois graphics nickum.such a motion does not raise affirmative factual defenses,but alleges only defects appearing on the face of the complaint.illinois graphics,at,kolegas heftel broadcasting.thus,the question presented by a section motion is whether the allegations of the complaint,when viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,are sufficient to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted.vernon schuster,bryson news america publications.when ruling on a section motion,a trial court is to dismiss the cause of action only if it is clearly apparent that no set of facts can be proven which will entitle the plaintiff to recovery.bryson,at,illinois graphics,at.a court of review determines de novo whether the trial court should have granted dismissal.beahringer page.
in contrast,a section motion provides for the involuntary dismissal of a cause of action based on certain defects or defenses.amongst the enumerated grounds for a section dismissal are that the court does not have jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action ilcs a west and that the claim asserted is barred by other affirmative matter which avoids the legal effect of or defeats the claim ilcs a west.affirmative matter must be supported by affidavit,unless apparent on the face of the pleading attacked ilcs a west,and,in ruling on the motion,the trial court must interpret all pleadings and supporting documents in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.in re chicago flood litigation.the standard of review on appeal is de novo.weatherman bank of fox valley,chicago flood litigation,at.
initially we note that gateway motion to dismiss borowiec complaint was for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and was supported by affidavit.the motion was more appropriately designated a motion pursuant to section than a motion pursuant to section.borowiec,however,was not prejudiced by the improper designation,and responded appropriately to the motion.accordingly,we will consider the motion as though it had been filed under section.wallace smyth,city of burbank czaja,d.
federal arbitration act 
turning to the merits of the appeal,we consider first the history and purpose of the federal arbitration act arbitration act or faa et.congress enacted the arbitration act in to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements that had existed at english common law and had been adopted by american courts,and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.gilmer lane,d.the arbitration act provides 
a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
the arbitration act also provides for orders compelling arbitration when one party has failed,neglected,or refused to comply with an arbitration agreement.the arbitration act reflects a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,d.
in gilmer,d,the court commented on the interplay between the arbitration act and statutory remedies created by congress.the court observed 
it is by now clear that statutory claims may be the subject of an arbitration agreement,enforceable pursuant to the faa.indeed,in recent years we have held enforceable arbitration agreements relating to claims arising under the sherman act,b of the securities exchange act of,b the civil provisions of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et and of the securities act of.citations.in these cases we recognized that b y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.citation.
although all statutory claims may not be appropriate for arbitration,h aving made the bargain to arbitrate,the party should be held to it unless congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.citation.in this regard,we note that the burden is on the plaintiff to show that congress intended to preclude a waiver of a judicial forum for the statutory claims.citation.if such an intention exists,it will be discoverable in the text of the act,its legislative history,or an inherent conflict between arbitration and the act underlying purposes.citation.throughout such an inquiry,it should be kept in mind that questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.gilmer,at.at,d at.
lastly,in doctor associates,casarotto,d,the supreme court commented on the preemptive effect of the arbitration act 
in southland keating,d,we held that of the faa applies in state as well as federal courts citation and withdr aws the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration,citation.we noted in the pathmarking southland decision that the faa established a broad principle of enforceability,citation,and that of the federal act provided for revocation of arbitration agreements only upon grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.in perry thomas,d,we reiterated s tate law,whether of legislative or judicial origin,is applicable if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts generally.a principle that takes its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue does not comport with the text of.citation.emphasis in original.
in the present case,both the labor services service contract and the limited warranty agreement contained a dispute resolution clause whereby the parties agreed that any dispute between them would be resolved by binding arbitration.thus,the claims advanced by the plaintiffs are subject to arbitration unless the plaintiffs show that congress intended to preclude a waiver of a judicial forum for their federal statutory claims.further,plaintiffs state law claims may not be premised solely on the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue.we turn then to provisions of the act.
the act was enacted in to improve the adequacy of information available to consumers,prevent deception,and improve competition in the marketing of consumer products.a.to that end,the act establishes standards governing the content of consumer product warranties and service contracts.through.the act also provides a statutory private right of action to consumers who are damaged by the failure of a supplier,warrantor,or service contractor to comply with any obligation under this chapter,or under a written warranty,implied warranty,or service contract.d l.the consumer may bring an action in either federal or state court and may recover costs and expenses that were reasonably incurred in connection with the commencement and prosecution of the action.as part of costs and expenses,the consumer may recover attorney fees,unless the court determines that such an award is inappropriate.d.
the act does not expressly prohibit arbitration,and,in fact,does not refer either to binding arbitration or to the arbitration act.the act does provide,however,that,prior to filing an action for failure to comply with any obligation under a written or implied warranty or service contract,a consumer give the person obligated under the warranty or service contract a reasonable opportunity to cure such failure to comply.e.also,the act provides for the establishment of informal dispute settlement mechanisms,and authorizes the federal trade commission ftc to prescribe rules setting forth the minimum requirements for the procedures.a.if a warrantor establishes an informal dispute settlement procedure which complies with the requirements of the ftc rules,and the warrantor incorporates in a written warranty a requirement that the consumer resort to such procedure,the consumer may not commence a civil action unless he initially resorts to the procedure.a.furthermore,in any civil action instituted by a consumer arising out of a warranty obligation and relating to a matter considered in the informal dispute resolution procedure,any decision in such procedure shall be admissible in evidence.a.the act nowhere defines the terms informal dispute settlement procedures and informal dispute settlement mechanisms.
in enforcing the act,the ftc has determined that decisions of an informal dispute settlement mechanism shall not be legally binding on any person j and has defined the term mechanism broadly to include binding arbitration.the ftc has also ruled that a warrantor shall not indicate in any written warranty or service contract either directly or indirectly that the decision of the warrantor,service contractor,or any designated third party is final or binding in any dispute concerning the warranty or service contract.in,the ftc affirmed that the regulations will continue to prohibit warrantors from including binding arbitration clauses in their contracts with consumers that would require consumers to submit warranty disputes to binding arbitration.
binding arbitration 
the appellate court recognized that federal policy strongly favors the judicial enforcement of arbitration agreements.d at.however,from its examination of the text of the act,the appellate court determined it was congress intent to ultimately preserve a judicial forum for consumers.d at.in arriving at this conclusion,the appellate court noted the act provides that a decision in an informal dispute resolution procedure shall be admissible in evidence in any civil action arising out of a warranty obligation and relating to a matter considered in the informal dispute resolution procedure.d at.the appellate court opined that an informal dispute settlement procedure is a prerequisite,not a bar,to relief in court.d at.the appellate court also referenced legislative history to the effect that an informal dispute settlement procedure is not a bar to legal action.d at.lastly,the appellate court relied on the ftc ruling that informal dispute resolution mechanisms,including arbitration,may not be binding upon the consumer.
in this court,plaintiffs urge affirmance of the appellate court decision.plaintiffs ask that we defer to the ftc interpretation of the act and argue that the agency interpretation is supported by the legislative history of the act.plaintiffs also maintain that,while the arbitration act policy favoring arbitration and the act consumer protection objectives are generally not in conflict,a conflict arises when a binding arbitration clause is inserted in an agreement purporting to extend a warranty to the consumer.plaintiffs believe this conflict must be resolved by giving precedence to the act over the arbitration act.we disagree with the reasoning of the appellate court and the arguments advanced by plaintiffs.
in arriving at our decision,we note that the federal circuits which have considered the issue have rejected the ftc interpretation.we find the fifth circuit analysis in walton rose mobile homes llc,cir,particularly helpful.in walton,the court of appeals reversed the district court order denying the manufacturer motion to compel arbitration of the consumer claim.the court first examined the roles of the judiciary and the ftc in interpreting the act 
when we review an agency construction of a statute that it administers,we must defer to that agency interpretation of the statute if congress has not spoken directly to the issue and the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.citation.the judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.walton,at.
next,the court examined the text of the act 
the text of the mmwa does not specifically address binding arbitration,nor does it specifically allow the ftc to decide whether to permit or to ban binding arbitration.although the mmwa allows warrantors to require that consumers use informal dispute settlement procedures before filing a suit in court,and allows the ftc to establish rules governing these procedures,it does not define informal dispute settlement procedure.however,the mmwa does make clear that these are to be used before filing a claim in court.yet binding arbitration generally is understood to be a substitute for filing a lawsuit,not a prerequisite.see mitsubishi motors soler,d by agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial forum.
we also note that binding arbitration is not normally considered to be an informal dispute settlement procedure,and it therefore seems to fall outside the bounds of the mmwa and of the ftc power to prescribe regulations.we thus conclude that the text of the mmwa does not evince a congressional intent to prevent the use of binding arbitration.emphasis omitted.walton,at.
the court then considered the legislative history of the act 
the legislative history does not specifically discuss the availability of arbitration,nor does it define or shed light on the meaning of informal dispute settlement procedure.the legislative history does indicate that such procedures were meant to be.for example,the house report on the mmwa states that a n adverse decision in any informal dispute settlement procedure would not be a bar to a civil action on the warranty involved in the proceeding,reprinted in.the conference committee report also indicates that if a consumer chooses not to pursue an informal dispute settlement procedure,a consumer can still pursue all alternative avenues of redress.conf,reprinted in.however,there is still no evidence that congress intended binding arbitration to be considered an informal dispute settlement procedure.therefore the fact that any informal dispute settlement procedure must be,does not imply that congress meant to preclude binding arbitration,which is of a different nature.the legislative history reference to civil action neither explicitly includes nor precludes binding arbitration.however,the reference to informal dispute settlement procedure seemingly precludes binding arbitration from its scope,as binding arbitration is not normally considered an informal procedure.binding arbitration simply is not part of these reports.these passages therefore do not support an assertion that congress intended to preclude binding arbitration.additionally,the conference committee report states that the legislation requires provision by the warrantor for governmental or consumer participation in internal or other private dispute settlement procedures.id.again,this does not indicate an intent to preclude binding arbitration.it simply requires that the consumer or perhaps the government participate in the informal procedures established by the warrantor.the committee can not have had in mind binding arbitration in its comments,as the government does not normally participate in private binding arbitration procedures.again,these congressional reports do not demonstrate that congress intended for binding arbitration to be included within the scope of these informal dispute settlement procedures,nor that it intended to preclude binding arbitration under the mmwa.walton,at.
lastly,the court examined the purposes of the act and considered whether they conflicted with the arbitration act 
we do not see any inherent conflict between arbitration and these purposes.consumers can still vindicate their rights under warranties in an arbitral forum.warranties can provide adequate and truthful information to consumers,while also requiring binding arbitration.arbitration is not inherently unfair to consumers.see terminix dobson,d congress,when enacting the faa,had the needs of consumers in mind.although the legislative history of the mmwa expresses a concern with the unequal bargaining power of consumers,see,at,a perception of unequal bargaining power is not enough to unilaterally hold arbitration agreements unenforceable.see gilmer,at.of course,courts can consider individual claims of fraud or unconscionability in arbitration agreements as they would in any other contract.see id.we thus can find no inherent conflict between the mmwa and the faa.walton,at.
the court concluded that the text,legislative history,and purposes of the act do not evince a congressional intent to bar arbitration of written warranty claims.there being no doubt that congress has expressed a clear intention in favor of arbitration,the court held the plaintiffs signed a valid binding arbitration agreement and must arbitrate their claims.walton,at.
similarly,in davis southern energy homes,cir,the court of appeals rejected the ftc interpretation of the act.in doing so,the court employed an analysis similar to that used by the walton court.the court reviewed the text and legislative history of the act as well as the purposes of the act and the arbitration act.the court found that the text of the act does not expressly prohibit arbitration.davis,at.further,congress did not express a clear intent in the legislative history of the act to bar binding arbitration agreements in written warranties.davis,at.the court also found that the declared purposes of the act do not evince such a conflict with the arbitration act as to prohibit binding arbitration of claims.davis,at.
unlike the walton court,however,the court in davis also examined the reasonableness of the ftc construction of the statute.initially,the davis court differentiated between the ftc legislative regulations and the ftc interpretive regulations.the court noted that the chevron chevron natural resources defense council,d standard of deference applies to the ftc legislative regulations and not to the interpretive regulations.the court observed that while we must defer to the legislative regulations in if they are reasonable,the ftc interpretive regulations are only entitled to respect to the extent they have the power to persuade.davis,at.
turning to the legislative regulations,the court noted that the ftc based its construction on congress grant of concurrent jurisdiction.the court observed,however,that a statute provision for a judicial forum does not preclude enforcement of a binding arbitration agreement under the arbitration act.consequently,the court concluded that the ftc motive behind the legislative regulation is unreasonable.davis,at.the court then referred to the ftc interpretive regulations 
the ftc further explained that binding arbitration agreements are not allowed in written warranties for several reasons 
first,as the staff report indicates,congressional intent was that decisions of section mechanisms not be legally binding.second,even if binding mechanisms were contemplated by section of the act,the commission is not prepared,at this point in time,to develop guidelines for a system in which consumers would commit themselves,at the time of product purchase,to resolve any difficulties in a binding,but,proceeding.the commission is not now convinced that any guidelines which it set out could ensure sufficient protection for consumers.davis,at.
the court noted this rationale was also unreasonable 
although the ftc first stated that it looked to a subcommittee staff report which appears to no longer be attainable to determine congress intent,the ftc continued,evincing its major concern that an arbitral forum will not adequately protect the individual consumers.the supreme court in mcmahon,however,rejected this same hostility shown by the sec.at.at declining to defer to the sec interpretation of the securities exchange act of based on the sec wilko attitude.instead,the supreme court holds that arbitration is favorable to the individual.see terminix,at.at noting that arbitration advantages often would seem helpful to individuals,say,complaining about a product,who need a less expensive alternative to litigation.davis,at.
the court concluded,a fter a thorough review of the mmwa and the faa,combined with the strong federal policy favoring arbitration,that written warranty claims arising under the warranty act may be subject to valid binding arbitration agreements.davis,at.see also southern energy homes,ard,so d in re american homestar of lancaster,stacy david,consuegra,so d abela general motors,but see contra parkerson smith,so d.
we also take note of the holding of harrison nissan motor,cir.in harrison,the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint because the plaintiff had failed to resort to an informal dispute resolution procedure provided by the defendant pursuant to the pennsylvania automobile lemon law.by the terms of the lemon law,the alternative dispute resolution procedure provided by the manufacturer had to comply with the ftc regulations promulgated under the act.the ftc regulations at issue required alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to render a decision within days of notification of the dispute.d.the regulations also provided that a requirement that a consumer resort to the mechanism prior to commencement of an action shall be satisfied days after notification to the mechanism of the dispute or when the mechanism completes all of its duties under this section,whichever occurs sooner.i.the district court denied the motion to dismiss and the defendant appealed,arguing that the district court order denying the motion to dismiss was equivalent to an order denying a motion to compel arbitration under the arbitration act.
on appeal,the third circuit noted that for the arbitration act to apply,the party seeking to compel arbitration was required to show the existence of a written agreement that contained an arbitration clause and affected interstate commerce.harrison,at.the court found there was an agreement qua agreement between the parties to submit the dispute to the alternative dispute resolution mechanism.harrison,at.although the warranty stated that the use of the mechanism was voluntary,and it alone did not constitute a sufficient written agreement,the warranty constituted an offer for dispute resolution that was accepted by the written request for dispute resolution sent by plaintiff counsel to the mechanism.harrison,at.however,the alternative dispute resolution procedure at issue was not arbitration within the meaning of the arbitration act.the court explained 
although it defies easy definition,the essence of arbitration,we think,is that,when the parties agree to submit their disputes to it,they have agreed to arbitrate these disputes through to completion,to an award made by a arbitrator.arbitration does not occur until the process is completed and the arbitrator makes a decision.hence,if one party seeks an order compelling arbitration and it is granted,the parties must then arbitrate their dispute to an arbitrators decision and can not seek recourse to the courts before that time.citation.
but the informal alternative dispute resolution process contemplated by the lemon law does not fit this characterization.rather,while many cases in which claimants invoke the informal process will proceed to an arbitrator award,some will not.that is because,under the ftc regulations with which a mechanism must comply,a dissatisfied car owner can file suit under the lemon law if he or she has not received a decision from the arbitrator after forty days.in other words,whatever the meaning of the first resort requirement,a claimant can not be barred from pursuing litigation under the lemon law if the mechanism delays for more than forty days.the claimant would not,therefore,pursue the procedure to completion in all cases.under all these circumstances,the informal dispute resolution mechanism provided for by nissan pursuant to the lemon law does not constitute arbitration within the meaning of the faa.
we find further support for the conclusion that the faa does not apply to lemon law adr procedures in the fact that the lemon law,the warranty act,and the ftc regulations all refer to the procedure at issue as an informal dispute resolution procedure.if the drafters had intended this procedure to be cognizable under the faa,then it is likely that they would have referred to it as arbitration.indeed,the term arbitration has come into this case solely because the mechanism has labeled the second part of its procedures arbitration.that alone is not sufficient to trigger the faa.we,therefore,hold that harrison and nissan did not enter into a contract to arbitrate their dispute within the meaning of the faa and that we lack jurisdiction over nissan appeal.harrison,at.
as noted above,the ftc believes that informal dispute resolution procedures include arbitration.further,according to the ftc,an agreement which contains a binding arbitration clause violates the provisions of the act because the act provides that informal dispute resolution procedures can not be binding on the consumer.by holding that an informal dispute resolution procedure does not qualify as arbitration under the arbitration act,harrison calls into question the ftc interpretation of the act.
in busch graphic color,quoting bowman illinois central,this court observed that decisions of the federal courts interpreting a federal act are controlling upon illinois courts,in order that the act be given uniform application.see also sundance homes,county of du page,wilson norfolk western ry,boyer atchison,topeka santa fe ry.this court has also noted that support for an agency administrative pronouncements must be abandoned where the pronouncements are found by a reviewing court to be at odds with the law.castillo jackson.as discussed above,in walton and davis,the fifth circuit and the eleventh circuit ruled that the ftc interpretation of the act is incorrect and a clause requiring binding arbitration of a consumer claim does not violate the statute.and in harrison,the third circuit cast doubt upon the ftc ruling that informal dispute resolution procedures include arbitration.accordingly,the federal circuit courts of appeals are in agreement in their interpretation of this federal statute.because federal circuit court authority on the issue is uniform,we,too,hold that the act does not bar arbitration of a consumer claims under the act.see weiland telectronics pacing systems.
e.other issues 
in this court,plaintiffs raise additional issues regarding the validity of the arbitration clauses.plaintiffs argue that the arbitration clauses are inconspicuous and are not disclose d in simple and readily understood language,thus violating section a of the act and the ftc regulations.plaintiffs also argue that the arbitration clauses contain a provision and are therefore illegal under the arbitration act.lastly,plaintiffs argue that the arbitration clauses are unenforceable,under ordinary state law principles,because of the provision and because there are exorbitant charges for the use of the arbitration procedure.we note that the complaints do not contain allegations in support of these claims and plaintiffs did not raise these arguments in the memoranda they filed in opposition to gateway motions to dismiss.we also note that the appellate court did not address the additional issues plaintiffs now raise.lastly,we note that in hill gateway,cir,the court required two customers who purchased a gateway computer to submit their claims against gateway to arbitration.in doing so,the court rejected several challenges to the validity of the gateway arbitration clause.in light of these circumstances,we elect not to address plaintiffs additional arguments.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,in the absence of such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,the circuit court should have granted gateway motions to dismiss the complaints and compel arbitration.the judgments of the appellate and circuit courts are therefore reversed and the causes are remanded to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
appellate court judgment reversed circuit court judgments reversed causes remanded.
i join in justice rarick dissent,but i write separately to raise several additional points,including my belief that the majority opinion runs afoul of the most fundamental of all statutory rules,namely,to construe statutes so as to effectuate the true intent of the drafters.see kraft,edgar,stating that i n interpreting a statute,the primary rule is to ascertain and give effect to the true intent and meaning of the legislature.
the act was specifically designed to protect consumers.see a stating the act was enacted to improve the adequacy of information available to consumers,prevent deception,and improve competition in the marketing of consumer products.the result reached by the majority,however,directly undermines this purpose by permitting manufacturers to slip mandatory,binding arbitration provisions into nonnegotiable consumer product warranties and,thus,to limit consumers avenues of relief in the event of a warranty dispute.because i believe this result contradicts the legislature intent to protect consumers interests in product warranty disputes,i respectfully dissent.
in rejecting the ftc regulations interpreting the act,the majority relies heavily on both walton rose mobile homes llc,cir at.at,at and davis southern energy homes,cir at.at,at.i can not agree with the majority approach to these cases.
in walton,the federal appeals court applied the test adopted by the supreme court in chevron natural resources defense council,d,to determine whether courts must defer to agencies statutory interpretations.under this test,a court must first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.at,d at.if the legislature intent is clear and unambiguous,we must follow it.chevron,at.at,d at.if congress has not clearly addressed the issue before us,however,we must consider whether the agency interpretation of the section is reasonable.chevron,at.at,d at.if the agency choice represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency care by the statute,we should not disturb it unless it appears from the statute or its legislative history that the accommodation is not one that congress would have sanctioned.chevron,at.at,d at,quoting united states shimer,d.
in the instant case,i believe the majority has unwisely chosen to follow the walton court erroneous conclusion on prong one of the chevron test.at.at,at finding the walton analysis particularly helpful.the walton court held that congress had spoken directly to the precise issue of whether binding arbitration provisions are permissible in consumer product warranties.walton,at stating that t he clear congressional intent in favor of enforcing valid arbitration agreements controls in this case.that mistaken conclusion,in turn,obviated the need to reach the second prong of the chevron analysis and,thus,to address the reasonableness of the ftc interpretation.walton,at.
the walton court error is apparent from both the text and the legislative history of the act.notably,the text of the act is completely silent concerning its interaction with the arbitration act in consumer warranty cases.walton,at acknowledging that the text did not address the permissibility of binding arbitration clauses in consumer warranties.under the chevron analysis,if the statute is silent on a given issue,we must next consider whether the agency construction of the statute is permissible.chevron,at.at,d at.thus,since the statute itself is silent on the precise question at issue here,the walton court should have proceeded to prong two of the analysis.at best,the statute silence necessarily creates a strong ambiguity regarding congress true intent on this issue.by overlooking the absence of any language in the act directly addressing its potential conflict with the arbitration act and rushing headlong to the conclusion that congress has directly spoken on this precise question,the majority in both walton and this case ignore the express directive of the supreme court established in the chevron test.since the act is undisputedly silent on this issue,this court should proceed with an analysis of prong two of the chevron test and consider whether the ftc regulations are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.at,d at.
in addition,yet another material ambiguity exists in the act,precluding adoption of the walton court conclusion that congress had already directly spoken to this issue.the scope of the term informal dispute settlement procedures in section is directly at issue here,yet it is not at all clear whether congress intended that term to include mandatory binding arbitration.this additional ambiguity in the text of the act again requires reviewing courts to examine the second prong of the chevron test and determine the reasonableness of the ftc interpretation.see chevron,at.at,d at explaining that if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.i believe that here the statutory language is inherently ambiguous and,thus,a reviewing court must proceed to prong two of the chevron analysis.due to the walton court failure to recognize any of these ambiguities,however,it erroneously concluded its analysis under prong one of the chevron test.
moreover,the supreme court has explained that,in examining the first prong of the chevron test,courts should view the relevant statutory language in context and with an eye toward advancing the overall statutory scheme.fda brown williamson tobacco,d.while the walton court purported to review the relevant legislative history,it appears to have applied the wrong standard in conducting the chevron test.walton,at.the court required a showing that the legislature clearly intended to preclude the arbitration of claims under the act before it would proceed to prong two of the chevron test.walton,at.as stated in chevron,the actual test under prong one is not whether the legislature expressed a clear intent to adopt the premise underlying the regulation subsequently issued by the agency but,rather,whether the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue.chevron,at.at,d at.i believe that,at most,when reviewed under the proper standard,the legislative histories of the relevant acts demonstrate the ambiguous nature of the relationship between section and the arbitration act.thus,the majority reliance on walton is misplaced.
in davis southern energy homes,cir,cited with favor by the majority here at.at,at,the federal appeals court also concluded that the legislative history of the act is ambiguous at most.as the davis court noted,a preliminary senate report on the act stated that it is congress intent that warrantors of consumer products cooperate with government and private agencies to establish informal dispute settlement mechanisms that take care of consumer grievances without the aid of litigation or formal arbitration.emphasis added.davis,at,quoting,at.viewed in this context,the congressional intent underlying section is not at all clear from the statutory language and legislative history,contrary to the walton court conclusion.accordingly,the davis court concluded that the intent of congress is unclear,requiring it to proceed to prong two of the chevron test.davis,at.
although the majority also supports its decision by looking to harrison nissan motor,cir,i fail to see how harrison adds any substantial support to the result reached in this case.harrison held that a voluntary,nonbinding arbitration provision in a car warranty does not qualify as a contract to arbitrate their dispute within the meaning of the faa,thus leaving the court without jurisdiction over the appeal.harrison,at.this is not the same case.here,a mandatory,binding arbitration provision,that is nonnegotiable and was unilaterally created by gateway,effectively cuts off all consumers rights to any opportunity for judicial recourse.
despite the widely conflicting analyses in walton and davis,and the tangential and inapposite reference to harrison,the majority in this case attempts to support its result by citing the uniformity of the federal appellate courts that have reviewed the issue.at.at,at.even a cursory examination of the walton and davis decisions,however,reveals that they could not be further apart in their rationales.thus,the purported uniformity of the federal circuit courts of appeals relied on here by the majority is illusory.regrettably,the majority opinion does not adopt a single rationale based on either of these cases,appearing instead to apply both.at.at,at.without any explanation of the specific rationale used to decide this case,the majority opinion fails to provide any guidance for future cases.i can not countenance such an approach to setting precedent in this state.
i also believe the majority has ignored a basic rule of statutory construction by approving the rationale in walton.the walton court failed to apply the general rule that more recent and specific legislation prevails over broader,earlier legislation.knolls condominium ass harms.see also at.at,at,rarick,dissenting,joined by kilbride.recently,the united states supreme court also applied this fundamental rule of construction.
the classic judicial task of reconciling many laws enacted over time,and getting them to make sense in combination,necessarily assumes that the implications of a statute may be altered by the implications of a later statute.citation.this is particularly so where the scope of the earlier statute is broad but the subsequent statutes more specifically address the topic at hand.as we recognized recently,a specific policy embodied in a later federal statute should control our construction of the earlier statute,even though it ha s not been expressly amended.citation.fda brown williamson tobacco,d.
here,the act was passed years after the arbitration act and expressly addressed consumer warranty issues.in contrast,the arbitration act concerned the use of arbitration in general contract disputes.under the applicable rule of construction,the act trumps the arbitration act when addressing arbitration clauses in consumer warranties because it was enacted after the arbitration act and deals directly with the consumer warranty issue.
the walton court relied exclusively on the favorable treatment of arbitration reflected in the arbitration act.walton,at.thus,the court relied on a general policy expressed in a prior,less specific statute.the supreme court has never invoked similar reasoning in applying the first prong of the chevron inquiry.walton,at king,dissenting.in doing so,the majority in walton failed to recognize the precedence that the act had over the arbitration act in consumer warranty cases such as this one.by approving of the walton rationale,this court has duplicated this error.
finally,if the act is viewed in the proper historical context,it is apparent that the disputed terms informal dispute settlement procedures and informal dispute settlement mechanisms fail to support the walton court conclusion that the act was not intended to preclude mandatory binding arbitration.see walton,at.assuming,arguendo,that the act is unambiguous,these terms must be considered in light of their meaning in,when the act was enacted.the walton court appears to have erroneously based its conclusion on its belief that,under today standards,binding arbitration is normally considered to be an informal dispute settlement procedure,and therefore seems to fall outside the bounds of the mmwa and of the ftc power to prescribe regulations.walton,at.that is not the correct context for reviewing the meaning of the statutory language.statutes are to be construed to effectuate the intent of the drafters at the time of their adoption.sayles thompson.
in,contractual arbitration outside the context of labor law was not the same highly evolved creation it is today,and binding arbitration was not the norm.today,binding arbitration is quite formalized,with many of the trappings of traditional litigation,but in,it was in its relative infancy.see d alternative dispute resolution,at.see also walton,at king,dissenting.i believe it is error to apply today standards to determine whether the informal dispute settlement procedures prohibited by the act include mandatory binding arbitration clauses in consumer warranties.as viewed in,informal dispute settlement procedures were equivalent to today alternative dispute resolution and meant any nonjudicial redress mechanisms.see d alternative dispute resolution,at.
a leading advocate of arbitration at the time,the american arbitration association,referred to arbitration as a settlement mechanism american arbitration association,a dictionary of arbitration and its,a concise encyclopedia of peaceful dispute settlement,and the plain and ordinary meaning of the word arbitrate included t o submit to settlement or judgment by arbitration american heritage dictionary of the english language.it is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that the plain and ordinary meaning of the language employed by the drafters is the best evidence of their intent.lulay lulay.moreover,the supreme court was also contemporaneously using the term dispute settlement to include arbitration,reflecting the widely held view that arbitration was a dispute settlement procedure.detroit toledo shore line united transportation union,d.
thus,the act prohibition of legally binding mechanisms j is properly interpreted to mean that permissible informal dispute settlement procedures,including arbitration,may not preclude subsequent judicial redress.arbitration may,however,be a necessary condition precedent to litigation under the act.in any case,it may not be the exclusive remedy for claims involving consumer warranties.
this interpretation comports with the primary purpose of the act,that is,to protect consumers.see a stating the act was enacted to improve the adequacy of information available to consumers,prevent deception,and improve competition in the marketing of consumer products.the result reached by the majority directly conflicts with this purpose by approving manufacturers unilateral inclusion of mandatory,binding arbitration provisions in consumer product warranties.as a practical matter,these warranties are contracts of adhesion,and the binding arbitration provisions are nonnegotiable.consumers possess disparate bargaining power and are faced with the dilemma of having to either take it or leave it.williams illinois state scholarship comm n.thus,even though the act was intended to improve competition,under the majority ruling consumers have no ability to shop for products without these overreaching,binding arbitration provisions.under these circumstances,permitting manufacturers to cut off consumers right to a judicial remedy and review can not be construed as upholding the legislature true intent in drafting the act.such a result flies in the face of congress express desire to protect average consumers from harmful overreaching in consumer product warranties.see a.
for these reasons,as well as those outlined in justice rarick dissent,i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion in this case.
this appeal presents a single question does the trade commission improvement act the warranty act et prohibit a seller of consumer goods from requiring purchasers to waive their judicial remedies and submit their warranty claims to binding arbitration in three separate lawsuits,the circuit court of cook county held that it did.based on that conclusion,the court denied motions filed by the seller to dismiss the purchasers complaints or to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings pending outcome of the arbitration.the seller appealed.the appellate court consolidated the appeals and affirmed.d.we subsequently granted the seller petition for leave to appeal.for the reasons that follow,i would affirm the judgment of the appellate court.
the plaintiffs in the cases before us are michael borowiec,tadeusz and dorota kobik,and leslie waldron.borowiec complaint alleged that in november of,he purchased a personal computer from gateway,now doing business as gateway.according to the complaint,borowiec began experiencing numerous defects and within the computer shortly after he bought it.borowiec alleged that gateway had intentionally or recklessly misrepresented to him that his service contract with gateway for labor services provided for repair,and that when he requested repair,gateway refused and required him to bring the computer to a gateway facility for service.borowiec further alleged that despite repeated attempts to obtain redress from gateway pursuant to a warranty which the company had issued when it sold the computer to him,gateway refused to honor the warranty,and the defects in his computer remain uncorrected.
according to borowiec complaint,he revoked acceptance of the computer based on the foregoing acts or omissions by gateway and filed this action against the company to recover his damages.borowiec complaint asserted four claims for relief breach of written warranty pursuant to the warranty act,breach of implied warranty pursuant to the warranty act,violations of the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act ilcs et west and common law fraud.
the complaint filed by tadeusz and dorota kobik paralleled the one filed by borowiec.it alleged that the kobiks purchased their computer from gateway on or about january,and shortly thereafter began to experience numerous defects and nonconformities with the machine.as did borowiec,the kobiks asserted that gateway had intentionally or recklessly misrepresented to them that their service contract with gateway for labor services provided for repair,and that when they requested repair,gateway refused and required them to bring the computer to a gateway facility for service.the kobiks further alleged that despite repeated attempts to obtain redress from gateway pursuant to a warranty which the company had issued when it sold the computer to them,gateway refused to honor the warranty and the defects in their computer remain uncorrected.
as a result of the defects and nonconformities with the computer,the kobiks gave written notice to gateway that they were revoking acceptance of the unit.this litigation followed.as grounds for their complaint,the kobiks asserted claims for breach of written warranty pursuant to the warranty act,breach of implied warranty pursuant to the warranty act,and violations of the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act.unlike borowiec,they did not include a count based on common law fraud.
the complaint filed by leslie waldron,the fourth plaintiff involved in this litigation,was similar.waldron alleged that she purchased a computer and services from gateway in november of.shortly thereafter,she discovered that the computer was defective.according to waldron complaint,the defects and nonconformities in the unit violated both the express written warranty issued to her by gateway and an implied warranty of merchantability.waldron contended that despite numerous attempts to have gateway repair the unit,the defects remain uncorrected.waldron further contended that gateway had intentionally or recklessly misrepresented to her that her service contract with gateway for labor services provided for repair,and that when she requested repair,gateway refused and required her to bring the computer to a gateway facility for repairs.waldron subsequently revoked acceptance of the computer,which,she alleged,remains in a defective and nonconforming condition,and brought this action against gateway for damages.her complaint alleged breach of a written warranty pursuant to the warranty act,breach of an implied warranty pursuant to the warranty act,revocation of acceptance pursuant to the warranty act,and violation of the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act.
gateway filed a motion to dismiss borowiec complaint,arguing that under the terms of the warranty it issued when it sold the computer to borowiec,borowiec had agreed to waive his right to seek redress in the courts and was obligated by the warranty provisions to submit any claims he might have to arbitration.in gateway view,that arbitration provision in the warranty divested the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction to consider borowiec complaint on the merits the circuit court was only empowered to compel borowiec to submit to arbitration.
the circuit court disagreed and denied gateway motion to dismiss.following an unsuccessful effort by gateway to remove the action to federal court,the company sought interlocutory review in the appellate court pursuant to supreme court rule 
in the kobiks case,gateway filed a motion under section of the code of civil procedure ilcs a west to dismiss the complaint based on the arbitration provision in the warranty issued to the kobiks when they bought their computer.in the alternative,gateway asked for an order compelling the kobiks to submit their claims to arbitration and staying their civil action until the arbitration was completed.gateway motion was denied.immediately thereafter,the company filed a notice of interlocutory appeal pursuant to supreme court rule.
waldron case proceeded in exactly the same way.invoking the arbitration clause in the warranty that came with waldron computer,gateway moved to dismiss her complaint under section of the code of civil procedure ilcs a west or,in the alternative,to compel arbitration and stay proceedings pending the completion of arbitration.as in borowiec case and the litigation brought by the kobiks,that motion was denied and gateway brought an interlocutory appeal under supreme court rule.
the appellate court consolidated gateway appeals in each of the three cases and affirmed the orders entered by the circuit court.in ruling as it did,the appellate court noted that under the federal arbitration act et,written contractual provisions requiring arbitration of disputes are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the court further opined,however,that in the case of consumer transactions,congress has overridden the federal arbitration act through the warranty act et.the court held that the warranty act and the regulations adopted by the federal trade commission ftc pursuant to the act prohibit the type of binding arbitration provisions contained in gateway warranties.accordingly,the court concluded that those arbitration provisions are unenforceable.consistent with that conclusion,the court found that the arbitration provisions can not operate as a bar to the plaintiffs claims in circuit court and that gateway motions to dismiss or to compel arbitration and stay the circuit court proceedings were therefore properly denied.
in undertaking review of the appellate court judgment,i begin by noting that the issues before us have arisen in the context of motions to dismiss.a motion to dismiss pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint but asserts an affirmative defense or other matter that avoids or defeats the plaintiff claim.see busch bates,d.for purposes of reviewing a court ruling on a defendant motion to dismiss,this court accepts as true the allegations of the plaintiff complaint.board of managers of the village centre condominium ass wilmette partners.motions to dismiss under section of the code of civil procedure present a question of law,which we review de novo.robinson toyota motor credit.
central to the dispute before us is gateway limited warranty and terms and conditions agreement,which governed the purchase of the computers in all three of the cases at issue here.the limited warranty and terms and conditions agreement contains a dispute resolution clause,which reads 
you agree that any dispute between you and gateway will be resolved exclusively and finally by arbitration administered by the national arbitration forum naf.any decision rendered in such arbitration proceedings will be final and binding on each of the parties.you understand that you would have had a right to litigate disputes through a court,and that you have expressly and knowingly waived that right and agreed to resolve any disputes through binding arbitration.this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce,and shall be governed by the federal arbitration act,section,et 
section of the federal arbitration act provides,in relevant part 
a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
although plaintiffs in each of the three cases before us asserted in their complaints that they revoked their contracts with gateway,they do not argue,for the purposes of this appeal,that the revocations avoided the effect of the arbitration requirement in the contracts dispute resolution clauses.nor do they dispute that the arbitration requirement would be valid and enforceable under the federal arbitration act,standing alone.their contention is that the federal arbitration act has been superseded by the warranty act et in cases involving consumer transactions and that under the warranty act and the regulations adopted by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto,arbitration requirements of this kind are prohibited.
the federal arbitration act,stat,was originally enacted in and then reenacted and codified in as title of the united states code.the purpose of the law was to reverse a longstanding hostility by the courts to arbitration agreements and to place arbitration agreements on the same footing as other contracts.equal employment opportunity comm waffle house,d,quoting gilmer lane,d.the supreme court has construed the act provisions as establishing a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration.moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,d.in accordance with that policy,the supreme court has held that courts have a duty to enforce arbitration agreements subject to the act.see express,mcmahon,d.the court has further held,however,that the mandates of the federal arbitration act are not absolute.as with any statutory directives,they may be overridden by a contrary congressional command.mcmahon,at.at,d at.
to defeat application of the federal arbitration act based on conflicting federal legislation,the party opposing arbitration of a dispute has the burden of showing that congress intended to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the rights at issue.such an intent may be discerned from the text of the congressional enactment or the enactment legislative history or through the existence of an inherent conflict between arbitration and the enactment underlying purposes.gilmer lane,d.
the warranty act,the statute in question here,was enacted in,years after passage of the federal arbitration act.while the federal arbitration act deals generally with contractual arbitration agreements,the warranty act was designed for a more specific purpose,namely,to improve the adequacy of information available to consumers and prevent deception in connection with written warranties issued with consumer products.a.
in keeping with its purposes,the warranty act sets out clear and comprehensive requirements regarding disclosures,duties,and remedies associated with warranties on consumer products.products covered by the act include any tangible personal property which is distributed in commerce and which is normally used for personal,family,or household purposes.there is no dispute that the computers purchased by the plaintiffs in this case fell within this definition and that the warranties issued by gateway on those computers were subject to the warranty act requirements.
while the federal arbitration act calls for enforcement of arbitration agreements,the warranty act specifically provides that where a consumer has been damaged by the failure of a supplier,warrantor or service contractor to comply with any obligation under the act or under a written warranty,implied warranty or service contract,the consumer may bring suit for damages and other legal relief in any court of competent jurisdiction in any state or the district of columbia.d a.an aggrieved consumer is also given the option of suing in federal court if certain restrictions are met.d b.moreover,if the consumer finally prevails in the litigation,the act authorizes the court to award the consumer his costs and expenses,including his attorney fees.d.
the right conferred on consumers by the act to seek redress in the courts is subject to two basic conditions.first,where an individual consumer complains that a company obligated under a warranty has failed to comply with its warranty obligations,the consumer must afford the company a reasonable opportunity to cure such failure before he brings suit.d,e.second,if a warrantor has established informal dispute settlement procedures that comply with rules established by the federal trade commission,the warrantor may require the consumer to resort to those procedures before pursing any legal remedies in the courts.a c.
when congress enacted the warranty act,it did not include within the statute itself a detailed listing of the standards a warrantor informal dispute settlement procedures must meet.rather,it delegated authority for prescribing the minimum standards for such procedures to the federal trade commission.a.pursuant to that authority,the ftc has adopted a comprehensive set of legislative regulations governing informal dispute procedures.et.those regulations provide that the decisions of any informal dispute resolution procedure incorporated into the terms of a written warranty shall not be legally binding on any person.j.interpretive regulations adopted by the ftc further provide that a 
warrantor shall not indicate in any written warranty or service contract either directly or indirectly that the decision of the warrantor,service contractor,or any designated third party is final or binding in any dispute concerning the warranty or service contract.
the ftc legislative regulations were adopted in.its interpretive regulations were issued in.those regulations have now been followed by the ftc for over a quarter century without deviation.as recently as,the ftc reaffirmed its position.in a regulatory review statement published in april of that year,the ftc determined that it would not amend j to allow for binding arbitration and that pt.will continue to prohibit warrantors from including binding arbitration clauses in their contracts with consumers that would require consumers to submit warranty disputes to binding arbitration,eff.april.
in view of the statutory and regulatory provisions i have just detailed,numerous federal district courts have held that the warranty act overrides the mandates of the federal arbitration act and prohibits warrantors from requiring consumers to waive their judicial remedies in favor of binding arbitration where,as here,an express written warranty is involved.see wilson waverlee homes,aff,cir boyd homes of legend,remanded on jurisdictional grounds,cir rhode e t investments,d pitchford oakwood mobile homes,d,raesly grand housing,d,yeomans homes of legend,wl.march,browne kline tysons imports,d,see walton rose mobile homes,llc,cir king,dissenting.state trial courts see philyaw platinum enterprises,no,wl.cir,intermediate appellate courts see in re van blarcum,and courts of last resort see parkerson smith,so d,southern energy homes,lee,so d have taken the same view.
the judgment of the appellate court now before us for review adhered to that precedent.several courts in other jurisdictions have recently adopted a contrary position.a divided panel of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit has held that the warranty act is not an exception to the federal arbitration act and does not preclude warrantors from requiring binding arbitration of claims asserted under written warranties.walton rose mobile homes,llc,cir.its interpretation is now shared by the eleventh circuit see davis southern energy homes,cir and has been adopted by the supreme courts of texas see in re american homestar of lancaster,directing appellate court to vacate order in in re van blarcum,and alabama see southern energy homes,ard,so d,overruling southern energy homes,lee,so d and by appellate courts in florida see stacy david,consuegra,so d,georgia see results oriented,crawford,aff,louisiana see howell cappaert manufactured housing,so d and michigan see abela general motors.
various rationales are advanced in this latter group of decisions to uphold mandatory binding arbitration in the face of the warranty act and its attendant rules and regulations.all are premised on the notion that the courts which have invalidated binding arbitration provisions under the warranty act have misinterpreted the act legislative history and text although the latter cases acknowledge that the decisions of the other courts are fully consistent with the ftc rules and regulations,they argue that the ftc interpretation of the law is,itself,erroneous and should not be followed.
gateway urges our court to adopt this reasoning and to reject the view taken by our appellate court and by the tribunals which have concluded that the warranty act forbids warrantors from requiring consumers to forgo their judicial remedies in favor of binding arbitration.a majority of my colleagues has accepted this invitation.i do not.
the federal arbitration act,which applies generally to transactions involving commerce,allows judicial access to be supplanted by arbitration.the legislative scheme created under the more recently enacted warranty act,which pertains specifically to warranties on consumer products,does not.although the warranty act makes provision for alternative dispute resolution procedures,those procedures may operate only as a precondition to bringing suit.a c.they may not be imposed as a substitute for legal action,as the ftc regulations recognize.
some have attempted to reconcile the two statutes by arguing that the informal dispute resolution procedures contemplated by the warranty act are distinguishable from and do not include arbitrations.i have found nothing in the text or legislative histories of the statutes to support such an interpretation.to the contrary,it seems clear to me that the informal dispute settlement procedures referenced by the warranty act were intended by congress to include all mechanisms of redress other than court proceedings,including private arbitration.current legal scholarship supports this view.lamis,the new age of artificial legal reasoning as reflected in the judicial treatment of the act and the federal arbitration act,loy.consumer.
to hold otherwise would contravene basic principles of statutory construction.if the warranty act were read to permit binding arbitration in accordance with the federal arbitration act,warrantors would have no reason to provide consumers with the option of pursuing any other type of dispute resolution mechanisms.warrantors would always opt for binding arbitration because that mechanism would foreclose any subsequent access to the courts by consumers and defeat the consumers concomitant right to obtain an award of their attorney fees from the courts if they prevailed see d.as a result,the provisions in the warranty act governing informal dispute resolution procedures would be rendered meaningless.that is fatal,for under federal law,as under the law of illinois,the court has a duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.statutes are to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word is superfluous,void,or insignificant.trw andrews,d,quoting duncan,superintendent,great meadow correctional facility walker,d.
the claim has been made that rather than thwarting the warranty act,enforcement of binding arbitration provisions under the federal arbitration act is actually consistent with the warranty act because that statute provides that nothing therein shall invalidate or restrict any right or remedy of any consumer under state law or any other federal law b and consumers,no less than corporations,should have the right to resort to binding arbitration if they so choose.i find this contention unpersuasive.there is no question that informal dispute resolution procedures,including arbitration,can benefit consumers by offering them the opportunity to pursue their claims in a manner that is usually cheaper than litigation,with simpler rules,less formality,and more flexible scheduling.see terminix dobson,d.that is why the warranty act encourages warrantors to establish such procedures.see a.where arbitration is mandatory and binding,however,and access to courts is foreclosed,the benefits flow primarily to the warrantors.that is why the warranty act makes recourse to informal dispute resolution procedures a precondition to litigation rather than a replacement for it.
that arbitration profits warrantors rather than consumers when it is made compulsory and binding is demonstrated by experience.if binding arbitration were advantageous to consumers,one would expect to find instances where warrantors were asking for judicial relief while consumers demanded arbitration.in fact,the reported decisions seem to be uniformly to the contrary.i have searched in vain for a single instance in the case law where the consumer is the party seeking to avoid litigation through arbitration.in every instance i have seen,the substitution of binding arbitrati
