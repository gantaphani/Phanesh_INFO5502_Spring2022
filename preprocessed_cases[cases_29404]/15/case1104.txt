a retailer sold gasoline using a pricing system,one price for cash,another for credit cards.signs that were clear as day were posted at each gas station to show the difference 
this opinion explains why,on the facts ofthis case,the retailer pricing system was a permissible discount,not an unlawful surcharge.
in an action filed for herself and on behalf of others similarly situated,rochelle linder alleges that thrifty oil violated civil code section part of the song beverly credit card act of,et by wrongfully imposing a surcharge on credit cardholders more specifically,linder claims that customers who purchased gasoline at thrifty california service stations between may and may were compelled to pay an allegedly illegal surcharge of roughly four cents per gallon more than customers who paid in cash.linder thrifty oil cal th,d.
thrifty moved for summary adjudication of linder surcharge cause of action.in support of its motion,thrifty presented evidence including a declaration by barry berkett,thrifty to show that it no longer operates any retail gas stations but that,when it did,it had a pricing strategy at some of its stations,under which customers paid a different,lower price for purchases of gasoline by cash than by credit card.the pricing was available to all customers at each station that implemented pricing,and each of those stations had at least one by sign that identified both the cash and the credit card prices for each grade of gasoline.thrifty also displayed on each gasoline pump both the cash and credit prices for the gasoline sold at that pump.
berkett explained that the two prices reflected the different costs to thrifty of cash and credit card purchases when a customer purchased gas by credit card,thrifty was charged a fee for every mastercard and visa purchase,whereas there was no extra bank fee to thrifty when customers purchased gas by cash.thrifty implemented a pricing system that provided a lower cost to its cash customers,whose purchases accounted for more than of the gas purchased at thrifty stations.the benefit of the system was that the customer was able to make an informed decision as to whether to buy gas with cash,and get the lowest possible price,or to buy with a credit card,and pay a slightly higher price while getting the convenience and security of not carrying cash.thrifty evidence included the photograph reproduced at the beginning of this picture of one of its signs that linder admitted showed clear as day that thrifty used a pricing system.
linder opposed the motion,but expressly admitted that thrifty no longer operates the gas stations,expressly admitted that thrifty had implemented a pricing strategy at some of its stations,and expressly admitted that the pictured signs had been posted.the only evidence offered by linder was a declaration by george brinton,an economist,who opined that,based on his review of berkett declaration and the photograph of the sign,there is a surcharge imposed in such a situation.it is likely that one can determine that fact issue from the face of the transaction itself.a person can compute the surcharge that occurs from use of a higher price for a product in several ways after the higher price offered by a retailer has been accepted by the prospective buyers.under economic principles,one can reasonably determine that the normal offering price to the public is the cash price shown in the photograph.when a company offers the same product on credit at a higher price than it offers that product for cash,the additional charge shown for credit is a surcharge for that service.emphasis added,underscoring in original.
linder did not dispute thrifty evidence about the additional cost it incurs when its customers pay with credit cards,and did not offer any evidence to suggest that thrifty pricing system was not devised precisely as stated in thrifty evidence.indeed,linder expert admitted that,if otherwise lawful,a surcharge amount could be justified in an economic sense if the higher credit price when compared to the lower cash price represents the actual cost to the retail company for the additional credit service.beyond that,all linder expert had to say was that a normal price could be determined by examination of a retailer business operations,and that economists regularly work in evaluating such matters.he did not say that he had done any such thing in this case,or that he had been asked to do so.he also suggested that the normal offering price could be determined from the number of service stations,as well as the volume of credit actually offered,when compared to cash transactions over the base period,but he did not say that he had made such a comparison,or that he had been asked to do so.
the trial court denied thrifty motion for summary adjudication,noting in its minute order that the issue was whether the two sets of prices on a sign shows a surcharge or a discount,and concluding that the interpretation of the sign presents a question of fact for the jury.thrifty then filed a petition for a writ of mandate,asking us to compel the trial court to grant its motion for summary adjudication.we issued an order to show cause and set the matter for hearing.
discussion 
the material facts are not disputed.thrifty pricing was based on the different costs to thrifty of cash purchases no cost and credit card purchases bank fees.at the stations at which pricing was offered,it was offered to all customers in the manner shown in the photograph of the sign.these facts support thrifty motion for summary adjudication because they establish a permissible offer to all customers of a discount for the purpose of inducing payment by cash,check,or other means not involving the use of a credit card,subd.a,and because they establish a pricing system consistent with the legislature intent to encourag e the availability of discounts by those retailers who wish to offer a lower price for goods and services purchased by some form of payment other than credit card,subd.e 
with that evidence,thrifty met its burden.as our supreme court explained in aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,a defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication has met its burden of showing that the plaintiff cause of action has no merit if the defendant has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.the defendant is not required to conclusively negate an element of the plaintiff cause of action,only to present some evidence to show that the plaintiff can not prove a necessary element of her cause of action.put another way,thrifty evidence was sufficient to shift the burden of proof to linder because thrifty evidence,standing alone,uncontroverted,and without submission of any issue to a trier of fact,would compel a defense verdict at trial.id.at,d.accordingly,it was linder burden to show,if she could,that thrifty pricing system constituted a surcharge on a cardholder who elect ed to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash,check,or similar means,subd.a code civ,aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,once the defendant has made the required showing,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show,with evidence of specific facts and without relying on her pleading,that a triable issue of at least one material fact exists.
linder did not meet her burden.indeed,she did not present any evidence to dispute any material fact.instead,she admitted by her failure to present evidence to the contrary that thrifty pricing system was based on the additional cost to thrifty for credit card sales,and that the difference between the two prices was related to the actual cost to thrifty.she admitted through her expert declaration that a surcharge is justified if the higher credit price when compared to the lower cash price represents the actual cost to the retail company for the additional credit service.the expert musings about the various means by which a retailer normal price could be established or might be established by examination of a retailer business operations,or from the retailer number of service stations,or from a comparison of the v
