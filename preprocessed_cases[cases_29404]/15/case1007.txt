in these coordinated class action lawsuits,the superior court granted a request of the class plaintiffs counsel to declare attorney ernest thayer a vexatious litigant based on his history of filing objections to class action settlements most particularly,the attorney fee awards in connection with those settlements in which he was a member of the plaintiff class or represented a member of such a class.thayer appeals the order,arguing that the vexatious litigant statutes code civ,do not apply to nonrepresentative members of a class who appear to assert objections because they do not have the status of a party in the traditional sense the statutes only apply against an attorney who appears as a party in propria persona and even if he was a party to the class actions in which he objected to the settlements,the statutes do not apply to his conduct.all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure.we conclude that objecting nonrepresentative class members who engage in the conduct specified in the vexatious litigant statutes are not exempt from being designated as vexatious litigants,but that thayer conduct has not,as yet,reached the level necessary to support an order declaring him to be a vexatious litigant.accordingly,we reverse the court order.
factual and procedural background 
beginning in september,various attorneys filed a series of seven class action lawsuits against el paso corporation and affiliated entities collectively,the defendants,alleging in part that the defendants engaged in conduct that was designed to,and did,create artificially high natural gas and electricity prices in california from march to may.these lawsuits,which were filed across the state,were ultimately coordinated in the san diego county superior court and assigned to honorable richard haden.the court appointed various law firms,including respondent lieff,cabraser,heimann bernstein,llp lchb collectively,class counsel,as counsel for the class plaintiffs.
in june,class counsel and the defendants agreed to settle the litigation for billion.class counsel prepared a notice of the proposed settlement,which included a notice that class counsel intended to apply to recover attorney fees and litigation expenses,not to exceed million in the aggregate,out of the settlement proceeds.the notice provided that proposed class members need not take any action to participate in the settlement,but that they would then be bound by the court determinations.the notice also provided that proposed class members who did not wish to participate in or be bound by the terms of the settlement would have to file a request for exclusion before a specified deadline.it set forth the date of the hearing for the determination of whether the settlement was fair,adequate and reasonable and the amount of attorney fees and costs to be awarded and invited members of the class to raise any objection to the settlement or the fees and costs application by filing a statement of objection with the court.
on october,thayer,acting in propria persona,filed an objection to the settlement on the following grounds that the absence of individual notice of the settlement to class members violated their due process rights that the notice failed to provide sufficient sources by which class members could find further information about the proposed settlement that the class members could not ascertain whether the settlement was reasonable without knowing a the amount of fees that counsel would be seeking and b the amount to be paid pursuant to the settlement agreement to various private and public entities in reimbursement of legal costs incurred that the amount of such reimbursements were to be based on the benefit conferred rather than the actual expenses incurred and that the amount of such reimbursements were to be made without further court authorization as to amount.thereafter,lchb and the other class counsel who had originally filed the class actions in northern california sought to recover attorney fees and costs of approximately million the remaining class counsel,who had originally filed class actions in southern california,apparently filed a separate motion to recover their attorney fees and costs.
the court ultimately approved the class action settlement and awarded million in attorney fees and costs to class counsel from southern california and million in attorney fees and costs to class counsel from northern california.thayer filed a notice of appeal from the court award of attorney fees,but this court ultimately dismissed the appeal after he failed to file an opening brief.thayer thereafter unsuccessfully moved to have the appeal reinstated.
that same month,lchb filed a motion in the superior court seeking to have thayer declared a vexatious litigant pursuant to section.in support of the motion,lchb filed evidence that,on his own behalf or on behalf of relatives,thayer had unsuccessfully asserted the same objection raised in this action in five prior class actions and that in four of those cases it had represented the class plaintiffs 
in re providian credit card cases,wl,nonpub.opn.providian acting as counsel for plaintiff kelly moreau,thayer filed an objection to the settlement on the ground that setting the deadline before the amount of fees were known violated due process the due process objection,as well as three other grounds.moreau,through thayer,appealed the trial court order awarding attorney fees in part based on the due process objection.in a december unpublished opinion,the court of appeal for the first appellate district,division five,rejected thayer arguments the california supreme court denied moreau petition for review in march.

kalcheim atlantic richfield,et.county.no.bc kalcheim acting as counsel for anne,thayer made numerous objections,including the due process objection,to the proposed settlement.in august,the superior court for the county of los angeles approved the settlement,although the record does not show that it specifically ruled on anne objections.
although thayer had raised numerous objections to each of the settlements,lchb motion focused solely on thayer repeated assertion of the due process objection.lchb argued that thayer repeated assertions of this single,unsuccessful objection rendered him a vexatious litigant as defined in section,subdivision b.
over thayer opposition,the court granted lchb motion,citing section,subdivisions b and.it found that thayer,acting on his own behalf or through surrogate family members,had litigated and continued to seek to litigate matters finally and adversely determined against him in providian and hurkes harris.the court order specifically cited the objections raised by anne in kalcheim which included the due process objection,as well as numerous others and concluded that because thayer had prepared those objections,he had caused them to be commenced,instituted or maintained for purposes of section.the order also cited thayer petition in the california supreme court to reinstate his untimely appeal in these coordinated proceedings.the court issued a prefiling order prohibiting thayer from filing any new litigation on his own behalf,or for
