under the deceptive trade practices consumer protection act dtpa we are asked whether an agent for a disclosed principal may be held liable for passing along false representations made in the course and scope of his employment.the court of appeals answered that question to the contrary,we hold that because the dtpa allows a consumer to bring suit against any person,an agent may be held personally liable for the misrepresentations he makes when acting within the scope of his employment.as a result,we reverse the court of appeals judgment,and remand this cause to the court of appeals for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
barry keyser worked as a sales agent for interests,a texas corporation doing business as the homemaker.in and,keyser sold homemaker homes built in oakbrook,a new subdivision located in pearland,texas.keyser showed prospective purchasers the different lots available,as well as how each home would fit on the lots.the lots were subject to a drainage easement held by the brazoria county drainage district on the back of each lot.each purchaser knew about the drainage easement on his or her lot.
david and lynette miller and several other homeowners the homeowners bought homemaker homes from keyser in the oakbrook subdivision.the homeowners informed keyser that they were interested in larger backyards,many wanting extra space for their children and pets.keyser represented to the homeowners that the homemaker lots were oversized and that they were in fact larger than the lots of a competing builder in the subdivision.keyser told the homeowners that even with the existence of the easement,the lots could be fenced along the back of the property line.the homeowners paid a premium for these oversized lots.
in,after the homeowners built their homes,some received a letter from the brazoria county drainage district telling them that all fences in the easement must be removed at the owners expense.as a result,the homeowners sued the owner of the homemaker,dennis bailey,and sales agent,barry keyser,for fraud and misrepresentations in violation of the dtpa.the homeowners claim that keyser misrepresented the size of the lots and where the fencing could be placed at the back of the lots.the homeowners sought to recover damages for the fence and landscaping repairs and a return of the excess charges paid for the lots.
the homeowners also joined the homemaker,but all claims against the corporation were dismissed as untimely.at trial,the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of dennis bailey.the trial court found that bailey had no direct communication with the homeowners,and he therefore made no misrepresentations about the lots.after the jury answered seven questions in favor of the homeowners,the trial court rendered judgment against keyser.
keyser appealed,arguing that as a matter of law,under the dtpa,a corporate agent can not be held personally liable for company misrepresentations.in reversing the trial court judgment,the court of appeals relied on our decision in karl kelly,to support its conclusion that an agent acting within the scope of his employment can not be held personally liable under the dtpa.the court of appeals reasoned that,in light of the jury findings that keyser did not act fraudulently and acted only in the scope of his employment,the trial court erred in rendering a judgment against him we granted the homeowners petition for review to consider this question.
ii.agent liability under the dtpa 
under the dtpa,a consumer may bring suit against any person whose false,misleading,or deceptive acts,or other practices enumerated in the act are the producing cause of the consumer harm a consumer may also bring suit for any unconscionable action or course of action by any person.the dtpa broadly defines person as an individual,partnership,corporation,association,or other group,however organized.the dtpa is a consumer protection statute,and according to the legislature,is to be construed liberally to promote its central purpose 
keyser personally participated in the sale of every home sold to the homeowners.he personally made the representations about the size of the lot and the location of the fence.he is the only person with whom the homeowners had any contact.based on the plain language of the statute,keyser is liable for his own dtpa violations.
keyser argues that he should not be held liable because he did not,in fact,know that his representations were false.but a dtpa claim does not require that the consumer prove the employee acted knowingly or intentionally the dtpa requires that the consumer show that the misrepresentation was false and that the false misrepresentation was the producing cause of the consumer damages a consumer is not required to prove intent to make a misrepresentation to recover under the dtpa the dtpa was enacted to protect consumers against false,misleading,and deceptive business practices,unconscionable actions,and breaches of warranty and to provide consumers with a means to redress deceptive practices without the burden of proof and numerous defenses encountered in a common law fraud or breach of warranty suit.misrepresentations that may not be actionable under common law fraud may be actionable under the dtpa thus,keyser may be held liable under the dtpa even if he did not know that his representations were false or even if he did not intend to deceive anyone 
keyser further argues that he is not a person subject to the dtpa because at all times,he was acting solely on behalf of the homemaker.he contends that the statute should not be read to allow a consumer to sue any individual person absent a showing that this individual acted outside the scope of his employment or that this individual acted knowingly.for support,keyser points to our per curiam opinion in karl kelly,mclerran 
the issues in mclerran arose in the context of a default judgment the defendants,an architect and a agent involved in the construction of a home,were sued under the dtpa based on their representations about the workmanlike quality of the home the default judgment happened because the defendants answered but failed to appear at trial.to support the default judgment,the mclerrans had the burden to prove that the defendants were liable in reversing the court of appeals judgment,we noted that the mclerrans produced no evidence that the defendants acted in their individual capacities and we held that agents of a corporation are not liable for the company misrepresentations unless there is a finding that the agents acted as the alter ego of the corporation 
ten months after our decision in mclerran,this court decided light wilson in light,the owner of a construction company was sued individually for unconscionable acts and breaches of implied and express warranties in violation of the dtpa we declined to hold this corporate agent individually liable because there was no finding that the agent individually violated the dtpa.this conclusion necessarily implied that individual liability could attach if it was found that the agent personally violated the dtpa 
justice spears,in his concurring opinion,asserted that light implicitly overruled the decision in mclerran.as stated by justice spears,l iability in these cases is based on the agent own actions,not his status as agent.we agree with this statement.thus,if there is evidence that the agent personally made misrepresentations,then that agent can be held personally liable.
we recognized our implicit holding in light less than two years later in weitzel barnes in weitzel,we concluded that when corporate officers make affirmative misrepresentations in connection with the sale of a home,the agents are personally liable under the dtpa even though they were acting on behalf of the corporation liability attaches because the officers themselves made the misrepresentations.
our holdings in light and weitzel comport with texas longstanding rule that a corporate agent is personally liable for his own fraudulent or tortious acts the plain language of the dtpa is in harmony with this rule.
here,the jury expressly found that keyser personally violated the dtpa and
