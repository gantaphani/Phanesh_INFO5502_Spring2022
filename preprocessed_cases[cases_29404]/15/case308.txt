the substantive provisions of the faa that are relevant in the present appeal are sections,and.section of the faa provides that a written provision for arbitration in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.section of the faa requires the federal district court in which the action is brought,upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration,to stay the trial of the action pending arbitration once it is satisfied that the issue is arbitrable under the agreement.id.finally,section directs the federal district court to order arbitration once it is satisfied that an agreement for arbitration has been made and has not been honored.

elite subsequently moved to compel arbitration of all of snowden claims and to stay proceedings in the district court with respect to those claims,or in the alternative,to dismiss all of snowden claims elite motion to compel proceedings the district court denied the motion without prejudice.in so doing,the district court operated under the belief that the issue of the enforceability of the arbitration agreement was inextricably intertwined with the issue of snowden suitability as a class representative.the district court stated its intention to revisit its decision to deny elite motion to compel proceedings at the time that it decided whether to certify the case as a class action.
elite noted a timely appeal of the district court denial of its motion to compel proceedings with respect to snowden claims.this is the appeal that is now before us.
although snowden makes no challenge to our appellate jurisdiction,the fact that the district court not only denied elite motion to compel proceedings without prejudice,but also stated its intention to revisit the ruling at a later time triggered alarm bells of a premature appeal for our consideration.significantly,when our appellate jurisdiction is in doubt,we must sua sponte raise and address the matter.lee wetzel,cir federal appellate court must always be sure of its appellate jurisdiction and,if there is doubt,must address the jurisdictional issue sua sponte if necessary braswell shipyards,beazer east,cir federal appellate court is compelled to raise sua sponte the issue of whether the district court properly certified for immediate appeal a judgment entered on less than all of parties claims,and if certification was unwarranted,then appeal must be dismissed.
having considered the relevant statutory language,we are fully satisfied that we possess appellate jurisdiction.under a a b,the faa expressly permits an immediate appellate challenge to a district court denial of a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration.id.an appeal may be taken from an order a refusing a stay of any action under section of this title,b denying a petition under section of this title to order arbitration to proceed brown root,breckenridge,cir citing a b and stating that provides for immediate appeal of an order denying a petition to compel arbitration.here,the record unequivocally reflects that the district court entered an order denying elite motion to compel proceedings.under the plain language of a a b of the faa,this circumstance is all that is necessary to grant us appellate jurisdiction in this case.we note that our sister circuits have reached the same conclusion in materially similar situations.sandvik ab advent int l,cir holding district court order denying motion to compel arbitration was immediately appealable under a of the faa,even though district court stated that it would have to determine whether there was an actual agreement to arbitrate koveleskie sbc capital markets,cir holding that,despite the district court declaration of a need for discovery before it could decide arbitration issue,there was no doubt that motion to compel arbitration was denied,and was thus immediately appealable under a of the faa.having satisfied ourselves that we possess appellate jurisdiction,we now proceed to consider the merits of elite appeal.
according to elite,the arbitration agreement contractually obligates snowden to arbitrate all of her claims in the present action,and the faa required that the district court grant its motion to compel proceedings.in response,snowden does not dispute that the arbitration agreement falls within the scope of the faa.nor does she dispute that her claims fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement.rather,snowden seeks to uphold the district court denial of elite motion to compel proceedings by attacking the validity of the
