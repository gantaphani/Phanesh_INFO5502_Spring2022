backgrounda.facts

in the bottom one inch approximately of the page,in much smaller type,the flyer informs cole that 
we have determined that you meet our initial criteria for inclusion in this special credit offer.because it is an exclusive opportunity we could not offer it to every one.you were selected based on information obtained in your consumer report from trans union and the final acceptance is subject to your ability to meet our full eligibility requirements.
id.the text then specifies the criteria that she would have to meet to take advantage of the offer.among the requirements,the recipient of the offer must not have a monthly car payment that exceeds of her gross income,the recipient must be eighteen years of age with an annual income of at least,and all bankruptcies must be discharged.the flyer then states that 
lender reserves the right to require consumer to pay off currently financed vehicle and may require consumer to increase down payment,which will affect equity and collateral.in any event,you are guaranteed to receive a credit line of at least three hundred dollars for the purchase of a vehicle,grsi,coral springs,fl.if at the time of offer consumer no longer meets the initial criteria,offer may be revoked.we hope you are pleased with the opportunity it affords.if you prefer that your name be omitted from future offerings,please contact trans union,marketing opt out,and po box,jackson,ms or call.

district court proceedings 
after receiving the flyer,cole brought the present action in district court seeking statutory damages and attorneys fees for alleged violations of the fcra in her initial complaint,cole alleged that she had not requested the materials that she had received from the defendants.furthermore,she had not authorized anyone to access her credit report,and therefore,there was no legitimate reason for the defendants to access her credit information.specifically,cole alleged that the materials did not qualify as a firm offer of credit as used in the fcra.she claimed that a n offer of a line of credit useable only to finance the purchase of an automobile is a sham.at.a.the offer was made,she averred,to obtain credit information it was not extended with the expectation that consumers would avail themselves of the offer.
cole also alleged that the terms of the offer were too vague to constitute an offer capable of acceptance.in support of this allegation,cole pointed to the fact that the flyer reserves the right to set material terms.additionally,the offer is ambiguous the line of credit is characterized first as guaranteed,but the flyer later states that g uaranteed approval is neither expressed nor implied.id.quoting.finally,she claimed that the reservation of the right to require the consumer to pay off existing automobile loans effectively constitutes an option to withdraw the line of credit.id.
the district court dismissed cole first amended complaint.it held that the defendants had obtained the plaintiff credit report for a permissible purpose under the fcra.specifically,the court held that the defendants obtained the report for the extension of a firm offer of credit.the court rejected cole contention that the credit line was too paltry a sum to be a firm offer.at.it reasoned that the complaint does not allege the credit line to be a sham nor is any inference in the mailing.id.the court found the offer of at least was consistent with the fcra because the fcra permits conditioning a firm offer of credit on the consumer being determined,based on information in the consumer application for the credit,to meet specific criteria bearing on credit worthiness that were established before the selection of the consumer for the offer.id.quoting l a,b.accordingly,the court concluded that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted 
cole then filed a second amended complaint in which she alleged that the flyer was not a firm offer of credit because it was a sham to justify obtaining credit information it contained an offer that is too vague to be accepted the language of the flyer was ambiguous or mutually inconsistent the reservation of a right to require the consumer to pay off existing car loans constituted an option to withdraw the offer and the disclosure did not comply with the requirements of d because it is not clear and conspicuous.
again,the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,and the district court granted the motion.the court found that there was a guarantee of a credit line and that the flyer indicated that the offer would be honored as required by the fcra.the court explained that there was no suggestion,other than cole conclusory allegations,that the credit amount would not have been honored.additionally,the court reasoned,some consumers would be eligible for more than the minimum amount of credit.
the district court also rejected cole argument that the offer was too vague to constitute an offer under illinois law.the court held that illinois law did not apply to the offer because there was a presumption,unrebutted in this case,that congress did not make the application of the federal law dependent on state law.the court believed that congress intended the fcra to have uniform application,and,therefore,the definition of what constitutes an offer under illinois law was not relevant to the determination of whether the flyer constituted a firm offer of credit under.the court therefore dismissed the complaint as amended.
cole timely appealed.
discussiona.standard of review 
we review the district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss de novo.see american united logistics,catellus dev,cir.we consider the allegations in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,cole,and take all facts and allegations as true.see delgado jones,cir.a complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.johnson martin,cir quoting conley gibson,d.the issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.scheuer rhodes,d.
firm offer of credit 
as set forth above,the district court dismissed cole second amended complaint on the ground that the offer contained in the flyer was a firm offer of credit for purposes of the fcra.in its view,because the extension of a firm offer of credit was a permissible reason for accessing an individual information under the fcra,the defendants actions did not violate the fcra.our consideration of the district court dismissal begins with the statute itself.
applicable provisions of the fcra 
the statutory definition in context 
in interpreting the fcra provisions applicable to cole claims,we must keep in mind the language and design of the statute as a whole.milwaukee gun club schulz,cir.we must construe statutes in the context of the entire statutory scheme and avoid rendering statutory provisions ambiguous,extraneous,or redundant we favor the more reasonable result and we avoid construing statutes contrary to the clear intent of the statutory scheme.in re merchants grain,cir.
section sets forth the congressional findings that prompted the adoption of the fcra as well as the purpose of the act.in this section,congress made it clear that the fcra is designed to preserve the consumer privacy in the information maintained by consumer reporting agencies.see a.specifically,congress stated there is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness,impartiality,and a respect for the consumer right to privacy.see also trans union ftc,along with accuracy of collected information,a major purpose of the act is the privacy of a consumer data.amicus br.at.one means by which congress effectuated this purpose was prohibiting the release of consumer credit reports unless the release occurs for one of the permissible purposes set forth in a.section a in turn provides that,s ubject to subsection c of this section,any consumer agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other 
many of the enumerated permissible purposes set forth in are transactions initiated by the consumer these purposes therefore do not create significant privacy concerns the subsection does set forth,however,limited situations in which a consumer credit agency may furnish a consumer report even though the consumer has not initiated or authorized the release.one such instance is when a credit or insurance provider is extending the consumer a firm offer of credit.c b i.in allowing consumer agencies to release information for the purpose of a firm offer of credit,congress balance d any privacy concerns created by with the benefit of a firm offer of credit or insurance for all consumers identified through the screening process.see.in exchange for allowing credit and insurance providers to obtain lists based on more sensitive information the bill requires that the credit or insurance provider make a firm offer,as defined in section of the committee bill,of credit or insurance to all consumers on the list.id.at.as one of our sister circuits has observed,congress apparently believe d that people are more willing to reveal personal information in return for guaranteed offers of credit than for catalogs and sales pitches.trans union ftc.
the statutory definition 
the term firm offer of credit is defined in the fcra as any offer of credit or insurance to a consumer that will be honored if the consumer is determined,based on information in a consumer report on the consumer,to meet the specific criteria used to select the consumer for the offer.l.the statute provides that the offer may be conditioned on three specific requirements.first,the creditor may apply additional criteria bearing on the consumer creditworthiness.see l.second,the firm offer may be conditioned on verification that the consumer continues to meet the specific criteria used to select the consumer for the offer.l.finally,the offer may be conditioned on the consumer furnishing any collateral that was both established before the selection of the consumer for the offer and disclosed to the consumer in the offer.see l.
application 
cole maintains that the offer contained in the flyer was merely a sham to justify obtaining her credit report.she argues that,given the insignificant amount of credit,the offer was not made with the expectation that a significant number of consumers would accept the offer,and,therefore,it can not constitute a firm offer of credit for purposes of the statute 
the defendants counter that the lynchpin of firm offer of credit is that some amount of guaranteed.according to the defendants,the fcra does not require a minimum amount of credit to be offered and therefore the preapproval could be for any amount,perhaps even as low as.appellees br.at quoting sampson western sierra acceptance,wl,at.thus,in the defendants view,the fact that the offer was only for does not take it outside of the statutory definition.
we believe that the reading of firm offer of credit suggested by the defendants,and accepted by the district court,eviscerates the explicit statutory purpose of protecting consumer data and privacy.see a.indeed,such a definition would permit anyone to gain access to a sea of sensitive consumer information simply by offering some nominal amount of guaranteed credit.the statutory scheme of the fcra makes clear that a firm offer must have sufficient value for the consumer to justify the absence of the statutory protection of his privacy.a definition of firm offer of credit that does not incorporate the concept of value to the consumer upsets the balance congress carefully struck between a consumer interest in privacy and the benefit of a firm offer of credit for all those chosen through the process.from the consumer perspective,an offer of credit without value is the equivalent of an advertisement or solicitation.it is clear that congress did not intend to allow access to consumer credit information for catalogs and sales pitches.trans union,at.such importuning not among the permissible reasons for which a credit agency may disclose a consumer credit information.see trans union,at see also tucker olympia dodge of countryside,wl,at.may,defining a firm offer of credit as merely any offer that will be honored elevates form over substance,exalt s artifice above reality and deprive s the statutory provision in question of all serious purpose.gregory helvering.see also clark,cir stating that the truth in lending act tila is remedial in nature,and the substance rather than the form of credit transactions should be examined in cases arising under it internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
we believe therefore that the district court focus on whether the offer would have been honored was inappropriately narrow although the statute requires that an offer of credit be honored in order to qualify as a firm offer of credit,see l the term firm offer of credit or insurance means any offer of credit or insurance to a consumer that will be honored,this element is not dispositive.to determine whether the offer of credit comports with the statutory definition,a court must consider the entire offer and the effect of all the material conditions that comprise the credit product in question.if,after examining the entire context,the court determines that the offer was a guise for solicitation rather than a legitimate credit product,the communication can not be considered a firm offer of credit.
in making this assessment,one important term for courts to evaluate is the amount of credit to be extended.however,neither a creditor nor a debtor considers the amount of credit in a vacuum both must know the other terms attached to that credit to determine whether it is advantageous to extend or to accept the offer.the terms of an offer,such as the rate of interest charged,the method of computing interest and the length of the repayment period,may be so onerous as to deprive the offer of any appreciable value 
here,the pleadings reasonably support the plaintiff claim that the offer was a sham made to justify access to the consumer credit reports.first,it is far from clear from the flyer that the offer of credit will be honored even if the consumer meets the conditions set forth in the offer.the offer initially states that,i n any event you are guaranteed to receive a credit line of at least three hundred dollars for the purchase of a vehicle,grsi,coral springs,fl.however,later within the offer,the following language appears guaranteed approval is neither express nor implied.therefore,the language of the flyer itself creates a question whether the offer of credit will be honored.
additionally,the relatively small amount of credit combined with the known limitations of the it must be used to purchase a a question of whether the offer has value to the consumer.finally,several material terms are missing from the offer.although the offer indicates that interest rates may vary from to percent,the precise rate of interest for a particular consumer is unknown.furthermore,the offer does not specify the method by which interest will be compounded nor the repayment period,although these factors are essential considerations in determining whether the offer has any value.these missing terms render it impossible for a court to determine from the pleadings whether the offer has value.because the allegations of the complaint state facts that would permit cole to establish that the communication had no real value,the district court erred in dismissing cole complaint.
clear and conspicuous statement 
cole also contends that,even if the flyer contains a firm offer of credit,it nonetheless violates the fcra for failing to make required disclosures in a clear and conspicuous manner.the district court granted the defendants rule b motion with respect to this claim without discussion.whether the disclosures contained in the flyer are clear and conspicuous is a matter of law that we review de novo.see lifanda elmhurst dodge,cir smith of illinois,cir 
disclosures required by the fcra 
the fcra provides that any person using a consumer report to make a firm offer of credit shall provide with each written solicitation made to the consumer regarding the transaction a clear and conspicuous statement disclosing statutorily required information.d emphasis added the notice must inform the consumer that the recipient consumer credit report was used in determining who should be sent the offer the consumer was selected because the consumer satisfied certain criteria the offer may not be extended if the consumer does not continue to meet the criteria bearing on creditworthiness or provide the required collateral the consumer has the right to opt out of future offers by prohibiting the unsolicited use of information contained in their consumer file and the consumer may exercise that right by calling a specified number or by contacting the credit agency at a given address.see id.
the fcra does not define the term clear and conspicuous,and,in fact,there is little case law interpreting the term as used in.see sampson,wl,at commenting on the lack of case law defining clear and conspicuous in the fcra.however,the term clear and conspicuous is a staple in commercial law.see channell citicorp,cir noting that neither the consumer leasing act nor regulations defined the term but that the words were staples of commercial law.accordingly,courts that have addressed the term in the fcra often have turned to cases involving the uniform commercial code ucc and tila for guidance.see stevenson trw,cir defining clear and conspicuous language used in d with reference to tila and ucc cases tucker new rogers pontiac,wl,at,addressing the phrase in d by relying on a tila decision sampson,wl,at relying on cases from the fair debt collection practices act,tila and other sections of the fcra to interpret the term in.
for example,in stevenson,the only federal court of appeals case to consider the meaning of clear and conspicuous in the context of the fcra,the fifth circuit looked to how the term had been interpreted for purposes of the ucc.that court stated 
the term conspicuous has been construed most frequently with the uniform commercial code,which requires that any exclusion or modification of the implied warranty of merchantability be conspicuous,and that any exclusion or modification of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose be made in a conspicuous writing.a contract warranty disclaimer satisfies the conspicuous requirement when it is printed in all capital letters,when it appears in a larger type than the terms around it,or when it is in a larger and boldface type.likewise,a disclaimer in boldface type,printed in all capitals on the face of the warranty above the buyer signature meets the definition of conspicuousness.a disclaimer is not conspicuous,however,when it is printed in small print on the back of the document,when it is the same size and typeface as the terms around it,or when it is not in boldface or capital lettering.
stevenson,at internal citations omitted.after reviewing these standards,the court evaluated the notice at issue to determine whether it was conspicuous 
trw notice of the consumer right to have corrected reports sent to creditors was printed in the same size type as the other terms in the same paragraph.the paragraphs around the notice appeared in larger,boldface type.even if stevenson read the back of his first credit report,there was nothing to draw his attention particularly to the statutory notice.we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that trw negligently violated the notice requirement of d.
like the fifth circuit,we believe it is appropriate to draw upon the wealth of ucc and tila case law in determining the meaning of clear and conspicuous under the fcra.the ucc defines conspicuous as so written,displayed,or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought to have noticed it.when evaluating a disclaimer of warranty against this standard,we have looked to how many times a customer was made aware of the notice,whether the notice was on the front or back of the document in question,whether the language of the notice was emphasized in some way such as by bolding the text or by employing all capitals and whether the notice was set off from the rest of the document so as to draw attention to it.see fuller kinetic,cir.
we also have considered the definitions of clear and conspicuous with respect to tila.at issue in lifanda,at,was whether a disclosure of the term of insurance and the amount of the premium was clear and conspicuous.we stated 
the term of the insurance is set forth in the auto theft registration form,but is set forth in the smallest type on the form,which is so minuscule as to be barely legible.although the district court notes that tila does not mandate any minimum type size,it simply does not follow that type size is irrelevant to a determination of whether a disclosure is conspicuous.if the term conspicuous is to retain any meaning at all,it can not be met as a matter of law by type disproportionately small to that in the rest of the document,and which is itself barely legible.far from being conspicuous,the disclosure here is quite the opposite.
id.at internal citation omitted.
the above cases make it clear that there is not one aspect of a notice that necessarily will render it clear and conspicuous for purposes of the fcra.we must consider the location of the notice within the document,the type size used within the notice as well as the type size in comparison to the rest of the document.we also must consider whether the notice is set off in any other,font style,all capitals.in short,there must be something about the way that the notice is presented in the document such that the consumer attention will be drawn to it.
application 
turning to the flyer,the required disclosures are condensed into a single paragraph at the very bottom of the flyer.the paragraph consists of nine lines of text that occupy,generously speaking,one inch of space.the font size is no larger than and is the smallest font on the page by several sizes.the notice is not distinct in any way except in how small it is either through color,emphasis or font style the remainder of the flyer,however,utilizes all caps,bold,italics and various font sizes to emphasize other information being communicated.
under any test of conspicuousness,the notice must fail.the type in this disclaimer fairly can be described as disproportionately small compared to the surrounding text indeed,its size approaches that which can not be read with the naked eye.the text is the smallest text on a page that is filled with larger type,as well as type that is bolded and italicized.the notice does nothing to draw the reader attention to this material to the contrary,the flyer appears to be designed to ensure minimal attention by the reader.consequently,we must conclu
