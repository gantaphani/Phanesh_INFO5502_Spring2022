discussion 
it is against the law to sell insurance without a license from the department,subds.a,b.insurance code section section defines insurance as a contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss,damage,or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event.section has been interpreted as requiring two elements shifting one party risk of loss to another party and distribution of that risk among similarly situated persons.truta avis rent a car system,d.truta.the department contends that the ldw meets these criteria.its starting point,and ours,is truta,where the court held that a car rental company collision damage waiver was not insurance.
the plaintiff in truta brought a class action against several car rental companies,contending they were engaged in unfair business practices by offering customers a collision damage waiver that was,in effect,an unregulated insurance policy.the truta court said that insurance regulations are not intended to apply to all businesses having some element of risk assumption or distribution in their operations.whether or not a arrangement is insurance instead turns on two factors to what extent the specific transactions or the general line of business at issue involve one or more of the evils at which the regulatory insurance statutes were aimed and whether the elements of risk shifting and risk assumption were a central and important part of the transaction or were merely incidental to other elements that gave the transaction its distinctive character.truta,supra,d at.
the collision damage waiver at issue in truta gave car renters the option of paying a day to be relieved of liability for damage or loss to their rental car of up to.the appellate court held that this was not insurance because t he principal object and purpose of the transaction before us,the element which gives the transaction its distinctive character,is the rental of an automobile.peripheral to that primary object is an option,available to the lessee for additional consideration,to reallocate the risk of loss up to the sum of to the lessor in the event the vehicle sustains damage during the rental term.thus,after reviewing the entire contract we are satisfied that this tangential risk allocation provision should not have the effect of converting the defendants as contracting lessors into insurers subject to statutory regulation truta,supra,d at.
the truta court relied in part on transportation guar.jellins cal d,jellins,where the plaintiff sued for breach of its contract to maintain and repair two of defendant trucks.truta,supra,d at.the defendant in jellins contended the contract was illegal because it amounted to insurance,pointing to clauses that obligated plaintiff to maintain insurance on the trucks and to repair any collision damage they sustained.the supreme court disagreed.
in reaching that conclusion,the jellins court said that the presence of risk shifting or risk assumption does not outweigh all other factors when determining whether a contract is subject to the insurance laws.if atte
