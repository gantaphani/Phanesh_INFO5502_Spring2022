five years after the food and drug administration fda first approved metoclopramide,a drug commonly used to treat digestive tract problems,under the brand name reglan,generic manufacturers such as petitioners also began producing the drug.because of accumulating evidence that metoclopramide use can cause tardive dyskinesia,a severe neurological disorder,warning labels for the drug have been strengthened and clarified several times,most recently in.
respondents were prescribed reglan in and,but both received the generic drug from their pharmacists.after taking the drug as prescribed for several years,both developed tardive dyskinesia.in separate tort actions,they sued petitioners,the generic drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopramide they took manufacturers.each respondent alleged,inter alia,that metoclopramide use caused her disorder and that the manufacturers were liable under state tort law for failing to provide adequate warning labels.in both suits,the manufacturers urged that federal statutes and fda regulations the state tort claims by requiring the same safety and efficacy labeling for generic metoclopramide as was mandated at the time for reglan.the fifth and eighth circuits rejected these arguments,holding that respondents claims were not.
held the judgment is reversed,and the cases are remanded.
and,reversed and remanded.
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court with respect to all but part,concluding that federal drug regulations applicable to generic drug manufacturers directly conflict with,and thus,these state claims.
a because analysis requires a comparison between federal and state law,the court begins by identifying the state tort duties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the manufacturers.
state tort law requires a manufacturer that is,or should be,aware of its drug danger to label it in a way that renders it reasonably safe.respondents pleaded that the manufacturers knew,or should have known,both that the use of their products carried a high risk of tardive dyskinesia and that their labels did not adequately warn of that risk.taking these allegations as true,the duty required the manufacturers to use a different,stronger label than the one they actually used.
on the other hand,federal drug regulations,as interpreted by the fda,prevented the manufacturers from independently changing their generic drugs safety labels.a manufacturer seeking federal approval to market a new drug must prove that it is safe and effective and that the proposed label is accurate and adequate.although the same rules originally applied to all drugs,the law commonly called the amendments allows a generic drug manufacturer to gain fda approval simply by showing that its drug is equivalent to an drug,and that the safety and efficacy labeling proposed for its drug is the same as that approved for the drug.respondents contend that federal law nevertheless provides avenues through which the manufacturers could have altered their metoclopramide labels in time to prevent the injuries here.these include the fda cbe process,which permits drug manufacturers,without preapproval,to add or strengthen a warning label and sending dear doctor letters providing additional warnings to prescribing physicians and other healthcare professionals.however,the fda denies that the manufacturers could have used either of these processes to unilaterally strengthen their warning labels.the court defers to the fda views because they are not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations,and there is no other reason to doubt that they reflect the fda fair and considered judgment.auer robbins.assuming,without deciding,that the fda is correct that federal law nevertheless required the manufacturers to ask for the agency assistance in convincing the manufacturer to adopt a stronger label,the court turns to the question.
b where state and federal law directly conflict,state law must give way.see,wyeth levine.such a conflict exists where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.freightliner myrick.
the court finds impossibility here.if the manufacturers had independently changed their labels to satisfy their duty to attach a safer label to their generic metoclopramide,they would have violated the federal requirement that generic drug labels be the same as the corresponding drug labels.thus,it was impossible for them to comply with both state and federal law.and even if they had fulfilled their federal duty to ask for fda help in strengthening the corresponding label,assuming such a duty exists,they would not have satisfied their state duty.state law demanded a safer label it did not require communication with the fda about the possibility of a safer label.
the court rejects the argument that the manufacturers defense fails because they failed to ask the fda for help in changing the corresponding label.the proper question for impossibility analysis is whether the private party could independently do under federal law what state law requires of it.see wyeth,supra,at.accepting respondents argument would render conflict largely meaningless by making most conflicts between state and federal law illusory.in these cases,it is possible that,had the manufacturers asked the fda for help,they might have eventually been able to strengthen their warning label.but it is also possible that they could have convinced the fda to reinterpret its regulations in a manner that would have opened the cbe process to them,persuaded the fda to rewrite its generic drug regulations entirely,or talked congress into amending the amendments.if these conjectures sufficed to prevent federal and state law from conflicting,it is unclear when,outside of express,the supremacy clause would have any force.that clause which makes federal law the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.can not be read to permit an approach to that renders conflict all but meaningless.here,it is enough to hold that when a party can not satisfy its state duties without the federal government special permission and assistance,which is dependent on the exercise of judgment by a federal agency,that party can not independently satisfy those state duties for purposes.
wyeth is not to the contrary.the court there held that a state tort action against a drug manufacturer for failure to provide an adequate warning label was not because it was possible for the manufacturer to comply with both state and federal law under the fda cbe regulation,at.the federal statutes and regulations that apply to drug manufacturers differ,by congress design,from those applicable to generic drug manufacturers.and different federal statutes and regulations may,as here,lead to different results.this court will not distort the supremacy clause in order to create similar across a dissimilar statutory scheme.congress and the fda retain authority to change the law and regulations if they so desire.

on writs of certiorari to the united states courts of appeals for the eighth and fifth circuits 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court,as to part.
these consolidated lawsuits involve state claims based on certain drug manufacturers alleged failure to provide adequate warning labels for generic metoclopramide.the question presented is whether federal drug regulations applicable to generic drug manufacturers directly conflict with,and thus,these claims.we hold that they do.
metoclopramide is a drug designed to speed the movement of food through the digestive system.the food and drug administration fda first approved metoclopramide tablets,under the brand name reglan,in.five years later,generic manufacturers also began producing.the drug is commonly used to treat digestive tract problems such as diabetic gastroparesis and gastroesophageal reflux disorder.
evidence has accumulated that metoclopramide use can cause tardive dyskinesia,a severe neurological disorder.studies have shown that up to of patients who take metoclopramide for several years develop this condition.mcneil wyeth,see also shaffer,butterfield,pamer,mackey,tardive dyskinesia risks and metoclopramide use before and after market withdrawal of cisapride,am.pharmacists,noting cases of tardive dyskinesia reported to the fda adverse event reporting system by.
accordingly,warning labels for the drug have been strengthened and clarified several times.in,the label was modified to warn that tardive dyskinesia may develop in patients treated with metoclopramide,and the drug package insert added that t herapy longer than weeks has not been evaluated and can not be recommended.physician desk reference ed.see also brief for petitioner pliva et hereinafter pliva brief.in,the reglan manufacturer requested,and the fda approved,a label change to add that t herapy should not exceed weeks in duration.brief for united states as amicus curiae hereinafter brief.and in,the fda ordered a black box warning its strongest which states treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia,a serious movement disorder that is often irreversible.treatment with metoclopramide for longer than weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases.see physician desk reference ed.
gladys mensing and julie demahy,the plaintiffs in these consolidated cases,were prescribed reglan in and,respectively.both received generic metoclopramide from their pharmacists.after taking the drug as prescribed for several years,both women developed tardive dyskinesia.
in separate suits,mensing and demahy sued the generic drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopramide they took manufacturers.each alleged,as relevant here,that metoclopramide use caused her dyskinesia and that the manufacturers were liable under state tort law specifically,that of minnesota and louisiana for failing to provide adequate warning labels.they claimed that despite mounting evidence that long term metoclopramide use carries a risk of tardive dyskinesia far greater than that indicated on the label,none of the manufacturers had changed their labels to adequately warn of that danger.mensing wyeth,see also demahy actavis.
in both suits,the manufacturers urged that federal law the state tort claims.according to the manufacturers,federal statutes and fda regulations required them to use the same safety and efficacy labeling as their counterparts.this means,they argued,that it was impossible to simultaneously comply with both federal law and any state duty that required them to use a different label.
the courts of appeals for the fifth and eighth circuits rejected the manufacturers arguments and held that and demahy claims were not.see,at,at.we granted certiorari,consolidated the cases,and now reverse each.
analysis requires us to compare federal and state law.we therefore begin by identifying the state tort duties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the manufacturers.
it is undisputed that minnesota and louisiana tort law require a drug manufacturer that is or should be aware of its product danger to label that product in a way that renders it reasonably safe.under minnesota law,which applies to mensing lawsuit,where the manufacturer of a product has actual or constructive knowledge of danger to users,the manufacturer has a duty to give warning of such dangers.frey montgomery ward.similarly,under louisiana law applicable to demahy lawsuit,a manufacturer duty to warn includes a duty to provide adequate instructions for safe use of a product.stahl novartis pharmaceuticals,see also.stat.ann.west.in both states,a duty to warn falls specifically on the manufacturer.see marks ohmeda.app,so,gray badger min.
mensing and demahy have pleaded that the manufacturers knew or should have known of the high risk of tardive dyskinesia inherent in the use of their product.they have also pleaded that the manufacturers knew or should have known that their labels did not adequately warn of that risk.app.the parties do not dispute that,if these allegations are true,state law required the manufacturers to use a different,safer label.
federal law imposes far more complex drug labeling requirements.we begin with what is not in dispute.under the drug amendments to the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,stat,et,a manufacturer seeking federal approval to market a new drug must prove that it is safe and effective and that the proposed label is accurate and adequate see,b,d wyeth levine.meeting those requirements involves costly and lengthy clinical testing.b a,d see also beers,generic and innovator drugs a guide to fda approval requirements a ed.
originally,the same rules applied to all drugs.in,however,congress passed the drug price competition and patent term restoration act,stat,commonly called the amendments.under this law,generic drugs can gain fda approval simply by showing equivalence to a reference listed drug that has already been approved by the fda j a.this allows manufacturers to develop generic drugs,without duplicating the clinical trials already performed on the equivalent drug.a generic drug application must also show that the safety and efficacy labeling proposed is the same as the labeling approved for the drug.j a v see also j g beers,a.
as a result,and generic drug manufacturers have different federal drug labeling duties.a manufacturer seeking new drug approval is responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of its label.see,b,d wyeth,supra,at.a manufacturer seeking generic drug approval,on the other hand,is responsible for ensuring that its warning label is the same as the brand name.see,j a v j g cfr a,a.
the parties do not disagree.what is in dispute is whether,and to what extent,generic manufacturers may change their labels after initial fda approval.mensing and demahy contend that federal law provided several avenues through which the manufacturers could have altered their metoclopramide labels in time to prevent the injuries here.the fda,however,tells us that it interprets its regulations to require that the warning labels of a drug and its generic copy must always be the same thus,generic drug manufacturers have an ongoing federal duty of sameness.brief see also fed.reg.t he generic drug labeling must be the same as the listed drug product labeling because the listed drug product is the basis for generic drug the fda views are controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation s or there is any other reason to doubt that they reflect the fda fair and considered judgment.auer robbins,internal quotation marks omitted 
first,mensing and demahy urge that the fda cbe process allowed the manufacturers to change their labels when necessary.see brief for respondents see also,at gaeta perrigo pharmaceuticals,foster american home prods.the cbe process permits drug manufacturers to add or strengthen a contraindication,warning,or precaution,cfr c iii a,or to add or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,c iii c.when making labeling changes using the cbe process,drug need not wait for preapproval by the fda,which ordinarily is necessary to change a label.wyeth,supra,at.they need only simultaneously file a supplemental application with the fda.cfr c.
the fda denies that the manufacturers could have used the cbe process to unilaterally strengthen their warning labels.the agency interprets the cbe regulation to allow changes to generic drug labels only when a generic drug manufacturer changes its label to match an updated label or to follow the fda instructions.brief,interpreting cfr a iv brief.the fda argues that cbe changes unilaterally made to strengthen a generic drug warning label would violate the statutes and regulations requiring a generic drug label to match its counterpart,at see also j g cfr a iii,b approval may be withdrawn if the generic drug label is no longer consistent with that for the 
we defer to the fda interpretation of its cbe and generic labeling regulations.although mensing and demahy offer other ways to interpret the regulations,see brief for respondents,we do not find the agency interpretation plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.nor do mensing and demahy suggest there is any other reason to doubt the agency reading.we therefore conclude that the cbe process was not open to the manufacturers for the sort of change required by state law.
next,mensing and demahy contend that the manufacturers could have used dear doctor letters to send warnings to prescribing physicians and other healthcare professionals.see brief for respondents cfr.again,the fda disagrees,and we defer to the agency views.
the fda argues that dear doctor letters qualify as labeling.brief see also m cfr l.thus,any such letters must be consistent with and not contrary to the drug approved labeling.cfr d.a dear doctor letter that contained substantial new warning information would not be consistent with the drug approved labeling.moreover,if generic drug manufacturers,but not the manufacturer,sent such letters,that would inaccurately imply a therapeutic difference between the brand and generic drugs and thus could be impermissibly misleading.brief see cfr b fda may withdraw approval of a generic drug if the labeling of the drug is false or misleading in any particular 
as with the cbe regulation,we defer to the fda.mensing and demahy offer no argument that the fda interpretation is plainly erroneous.see auer,at.accordingly,we conclude that federal law did not permit the manufacturers to issue additional warnings through dear doctor letters.
though the fda denies that the manufacturers could have used the cbe process or dear doctor letters to strengthen their warning labels,the agency asserts that a different avenue existed for changing generic drug labels.according to the fda,the manufacturers could have proposed indeed,were required to propose stronger warning labels to the agency if they believed such warnings were needed.brief fed.reg.if the fda had agreed that a label change was necessary,it would have worked with the manufacturer to create a new label for both the and generic drug.ibid.
the agency traces this duty to f,which provides that a drug is misbranded u nless its labeling bears adequate warnings against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or application,in such manner and form,as are necessary for the protection of users.see brief.by regulation,the fda has interpreted that statute to require that labeling shall be revised to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug.cfr e.
according to the fda,these requirements apply to drugs.as it explains,a central premise of federal drug regulation is that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.brief quoting wyeth,at.the fda reconciles this duty to have adequate and accurate labeling with the duty of sameness in the following way generic drug manufacturers that become aware of safety problems must ask the agency to work toward strengthening the label that applies to both the generic and equivalent drug.brief.
the manufacturers and the fda disagree over whether this alleged duty to request a strengthened label actually existed.the fda argues that it explained this duty in the preamble to its regulations implementing the amendments.see fed.reg.if a generic drug manufacturer believes new safety information should be added to a product labeling,it should contact fda,and fda will determine whether the labeling for the generic and listed drugs should be revised the manufacturers claim that the fda statement did not create a duty,and that there is no of any generic drug manufacturer ever acting pursuant to any such duty.see tr.of oral arg.reply brief for petitioner pliva et.because we ultimately find even assuming such a duty existed,we do not resolve the matter.
to summarize,the relevant state and federal requirements are these state tort law places a duty directly on all drug manufacturers to adequately and safely label their products.taking mensing and demahy allegations as true,this duty required the manufacturers to use a different,stronger label than the label they actually used.federal drug regulations,as interpreted by the fda,prevented the manufacturers from independently changing their generic drugs safety labels.but,we assume,federal law also required the manufacturers to ask for fda assistance in convincing the manufacturer to adopt a stronger label,so that all corresponding generic drug manufacturers could do so as well.we turn now to the question of.
the supremacy clause establishes that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.art.vi,cl.where state and federal law directly conflict,state law must give way.wyeth,supra,at thomas,concurring in judgment see also crosby national foreign trade council,s tate law is naturally preempted to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute we have held that state and federal law conflict where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.freightliner myrick,internal quotation marks omitted 
we find impossibility here.it was not lawful under federal law for the manufacturers to do what state law required of them.and even if they had fulfilled their federal duty to ask for fda assistance,they would not have satisfied the requirements of state law.
if the manufacturers had independently changed their labels to satisfy their duty,they would have violated federal law.taking mensing and demahy allegations as true,state law imposed on the a duty to attach a safer label to their generic metoclopramide.federal law,however,demanded that drug labels be the same at all times as the drug labels.see,cfr b.thus,it was impossible for the manufacturers to comply with both their duty to change the label and their federal law duty to keep the label the same.
the federal duty to ask the fda for help in strengthening the corresponding label,assuming such a duty exists,does not change this analysis.although requesting fda assistance would have satisfied the federal duty,it would not have satisfied their state duty to provide adequate labeling.state law demanded a safer label it did not instruct the manufacturers to communicate with the fda about the possibility of a safer label.indeed,mensing and demahy deny that their state tort claims are based on the manufacturers alleged failure to ask the fda for assistance in changing the labels.brief for respondents buckman plaintiffs legal,holding that federal drug and medical device laws a state claim based on failure to properly communicate with the fda.
mensing and demahy contend that,while their claims do not turn on whether the manufacturers asked the fda for assistance in changing their labels,the manufacturers federal affirmative defense of does.mensing and demahy argue that if the manufacturers had asked the fda for help in changing the corresponding label,they might eventually have been able to accomplish under federal law what state law requires.that is true enough.the manufacturers freely concede that they could have asked the fda for help.pliva brief.if they had done so,and if the fda decided there was sufficient supporting information,and if the fda undertook negotiations with the manufacturer,and if adequate label changes were decided on and implemented,then the manufacturers would have started a mouse trap game that eventually led to a better label on generic metoclopramide.
this raises the novel question whether conflict should take into account these possible actions by the fda and the manufacturer.here,what federal law permitted the manufacturers to do could have changed,even absent a change in the law itself,depending on the actions of the fda and the manufacturer.federal law does not dictate the text of each generic drug label,but rather ties those labels to their counterparts.thus,federal law would permit the manufacturers to comply with the state labeling requirements if,and only if,the fda and the manufacturer changed the label to do so.
mensing and demahy assert that when a private party ability to comply with state law depends on approval and assistance from the fda,proving requires that party to demonstrate that the fda would not have allowed compliance with state law.here,they argue,the manufacturers can not bear their burden of proving impossibility because they did not even try to start the process that might ultimately have allowed them to use a safer label.brief for respondents.this is a fair argument,but we reject it.
the question for impossibility is whether the private party could independently do under federal law what state law requires of it.see wyeth,at finding no where the defendant could unilaterally do what state law required.accepting mensing and demahy argument would render conflict largely meaningless because it would make most conflicts between state and federal law illusory.we can often imagine that a third party or the federal government might do something that makes it lawful for a private party to accomplish under federal law what state law requires of it.in these cases,it is certainly possible that,had the manufacturers asked the fda for help,they might have eventually been able to strengthen their warning label.of course,it is also possible that the manufacturers could have convinced the fda to reinterpret its regulations in a manner that would have opened the cbe process to them.following mensing and demahy argument to its logical conclusion,it is also possible that,by asking,the manufacturers could have persuaded the fda to rewrite its generic drug regulations entirely or talked congress into amending the amendments.
if these conjectures suffice to prevent federal and state law from conflicting for supremacy clause purposes,it is unclear when,outside of express,the supremacy clause would have any force we do not read the supremacy clause to permit an approach to that renders conflict all but meaningless.the supremacy clause,on its face,makes federal law the supreme law of the land even absent an express statement by congress,art.vi,cl.
moreover,the text of the clause that federal law shall be supreme,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding plainly contemplates conflict by describing federal law as effectively repealing contrary state law.see nelson,preemption,at describing discussion of the supremacy clause in state ratification debates as concerning whether federal law could repeal state law,or vice versa.the phrase any state law to the contrary notwithstanding is a non provision,at,nn.legislatures used non obstante provisions to specify the degree to which a new statute was meant to repeal older,potentially conflicting statutes in the same field,at citing dozens of statutes from the and with similar provisions.a non obstante provision in a new statute acknowledged that the statute might contradict prior law and instructed courts not to apply the general presumption against implied repeals.at bacon,a new abridgment of the law ed.although two acts of parliament are seemingly repugnant,yet if there be no clause of non obstante in the latter,they shall if possible have such construction,that the latter may not be a repeal of the former by implication the non obstante provision in the supremacy clause therefore suggests that federal law should be understood to impliedly repeal conflicting state law.
further,the provision suggests that courts should not strain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly conflicting state law.traditionally,courts went to great lengths attempting to harmonize conflicting statutes,in order to avoid implied repeals.warder arell,opinion of roane,w e ought to seek for such a construction as will reconcile the statutes together ludlow heirs johnston,ohio,i f by any fair course of reasoning the two statutes can be reconciled,both shall stand doolittle bryan,how,requiring the repugnance be quite plain before finding implied repeal.a non obstante provision thus was a useful way for legislatures to specify that they did not want courts distorting the new law to accommodate the old.nelson,supra,at see also sutherland,statutes and statutory construction,w hen there is inserted in a statute a provision of non obstante.it is to be supposed that courts will be less inclined against recognizing repugnancy in applying such statutes weston case,eng,w hen there are two statutes,one in appearance crossing the other,and no clause of non obstante is contained in the second statute the exposition ought to be that both should stand in force jacob,a new law dictionary morgan,ed.definition of statute,w hen there is a seeming variance between two statutes,and no clause of non obstante in the latter,such construction shall be made that both may stand the non obstante provision of he supremacy clause indicates that a court need look no further than the ordinary meanin g of federal law,and should not distort federal law to accommodate conflicting state law.wyeth,at thomas,concurring in judgment internal quotation marks omitted.
to consider in our analysis the contingencies inherent in these cases in which the manufacturers ability to comply with state law depended on uncertain federal agency and decisions would be inconsistent with the non obstante provision of the supremacy clause.the manufacturers would be required continually to prove the counterfactual conduct of the fda and manufacturer in order to establish the supremacy of federal law.we do not think the supremacy clause contemplates that sort of contingent supremacy.the non obstante provision suggests that analysis should not involve speculation about ways in which federal agency and actions could potentially reconcile federal duties with conflicting state duties.when the ordinary meaning of federal law blocks a private party from independently accomplishing what state law requires,that party has established.
to be sure,whether a private party can act sufficiently independently under federal law to do what state law requires may sometimes be difficult to determine.but this is not such a case.before the manufacturers could satisfy state law,the fda a federal agency had to undertake special effort permitting them to do so.to decide these cases,it is enough to hold that when a party can not satisfy its state duties without the federal government special permission and assistance,which is dependent on the exercise of judgment by a federal agency,that party can not independently satisfy those state duties for purposes.
here,state law imposed a duty on the manufacturers to take a certain action,and federal law barred them from taking that action.the only action the manufacturers could independently take asking for the fda help is not a matter of concern.mensing and demahy tort claims are.
wyeth is not to the contrary.in that case,as here,the plaintiff contended that a drug manufacturer had breached a state duty to provide an adequate warning label,at.the court held that the lawsuit was not because it was possible for wyeth,a drug manufacturer,to comply with both state and federal law,at specifically,the cbe regulation,cfr c iii,permitted a drug manufacturer like wyeth to unilaterally strengthen its warning without prior fda approval,at supra,at.thus,the federal regulations applicable to wyeth allowed the company,of its own volition,to strengthen its label in compliance with its state tort duty 
we recognize that from the perspective of mensing and demahy,finding here but not in wyeth makes little sense.had mensing and demahy taken reglan,the drug prescribed by their doctors,wyeth would control and their lawsuits would not be.but because pharmacists,acting in full accord with state law,substituted generic metoclopramide instead,federal law these lawsuits.see.stat.describing when pharmacists may substitute drugs.stat.ann.a west same.we acknowledge the unfortunate hand that federal drug regulation has dealt mensing,demahy,and others similarly situated 
but it is not this court task to decide whether the statutory scheme established by congress is unusual or even bizarre.cuomo clearing house,thomas,concurring in part and dissenting in part slip,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.it is beyond dispute that the federal statutes and regulations that apply to drug manufacturers are meaningfully different than those that apply to generic drug manufacturers.indeed,it is the special,and different,regulation of generic drugs that allowed the generic drug market to expand,bringing more drugs more quickly and cheaply to the public.but different federal statutes and regulations may,as here,lead to different results.we will not distort the supremacy clause in order to create similar across a dissimilar statutory scheme.as always,congress and the fda retain the authority to change the law and regulations if they so desire.

on writs of certiorari to the united states courts of appeals for the eighth and fifth circuits 
justice sotomayor,with whom justice ginsburg,justice breyer,and justice kagan join,dissenting.
the court today invokes the doctrine of impossibility to hold that federal law immunizes manufacturers from all claims because they can not unilaterally change their.i can not agree.we have traditionally held defendants claiming impossibility to a demanding standard until today,the mere possibility of impossibility had not been enough to establish.
the food and drug administration fda permits and,the court assumes,requires manufacturers to propose a label change to the fda when they believe that their labels are inadequate.if it agrees that the labels are inadequate,the fda can initiate a change to the label,triggering a corresponding change to the generic labels.once that occurs,a generic manufacturer is in full compliance with both federal law and a duty to warn.although generic manufacturers may be able to show impossibility in some cases,petitioners,generic manufacturers of metoclopramide manufacturers,have shown only that they might have been unable to comply with both federal law and their duties to warn respondents gladys mensing and julie demahy.this,i would hold,is insufficient to sustain their burden.
the court strains to reach the opposite conclusion.it invents new principles of law out of thin air to justify its dilution of the impossibility standard.it effectively rewrites our decision in wyeth levine,which holds that federal law does not claims against drug manufacturers.and a plurality of the court tosses aside our repeated admonition that courts should hesitate to conclude that congress intended to state laws governing health and safety.as a result of today decision,whether a consumer harmed by inadequate warnings can obtain relief turns solely on the happenstance of whether her pharmacist filled her prescription with a or generic drug.the court gets one thing right this outcome makes little sense.ante,at.
today decision affects percent of all prescription drugs dispensed in this country.the dominant position of generic drugs in the prescription drug market is the result of a series of legislative measures,both federal and state.
in,congress enacted the drug price competition and patent term restoration act,stat.commonly known as the amendments to the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca to make available more low cost generic drugs by establishing a generic drug approval procedure,pt.as the majority explains,to accomplish this goal the amendments establish an abbreviated application process for generic drugs.ante,at see also j a.the abbreviated approval process implements the amendments core principle that generic and drugs must be the same in nearly all respects to obtain fda approval,a generic manufacturer must ordinarily show,among other things,that its product has the same active ingredients as an approved drug that the route of,the dosage form,and the strength of the new drug are the same as the drug and that its product is bioequivalent to the drug.j a ii,iii,iv.by eliminating the need for generic manufacturers to prove their drugs safety and efficacy independently,the amendments allow generic manufacturers to bring drugs to market much less expensively.
the states have also acted to expand consumption of generic drugs.in the years leading up to passage of the amendments,states enacted legislation authorizing pharmacists to substitute generic drugs when filling prescriptions for drugs.christensen,kirking,ascione,welage,gaither,drug product selection legal issues,am.pharmaceutical.currently,all states have some form of generic substitution law.see ibid.some states require generic substitution in certain circumstances.of health and human,aspe issue brief expanding the use of generic drugs hereinafter expanding the use of generic drugs see,educ.law ann.west.others permit,but do not require,substitution.expanding the use of generic drugs see,cal.bus.code ann.west supp.some states require patient consent to substitution,and all states allow the physician to specify that the brand name must be prescribed,although with different levels of effort from the physician.expanding the use of generic drugs 
these legislative efforts to expand production and consumption of generic drugs have proved wildly successful.it is estimated that in,when the amendments were enacted,generic drugs constituted percent of drugs sold in this country.congressional office,how increased competition from generic drugs has affected prices and returns in the pharmaceutical industry today,they dominate the market.see expanding the use of generic drugs generic drugs constituted percent of all dispensed prescription drugs in.ninety percent of drugs for which a generic version is available are now filled with generics,at.in many cases,once generic versions of a drug enter the market,the manufacturer stops selling the drug altogether.see brief for marc law et as amici curiae citing studies showing that anywhere from to of generic drugs no longer have a marketed equivalent.reflecting the success of their products,many generic manufacturers,including the manufacturers and their amici,are huge,multinational companies.in total,generic drug manufacturers sold an estimated billion of drugs in this country in.see,at.
as noted,to obtain fda approval a generic manufacturer must generally show that its drug is the same as an approved drug.it need not conduct clinical trials to prove the safety and efficacy of the drug.this does not mean,however,that a generic manufacturer has no duty under federal law to ensure the safety of its products.the fda has limited resources to conduct postapproval monitoring of drug safety.see wyeth,at.manufacturers,we have recognized,have superior access to information about their drugs,especially in the postmarketing phase as new risks emerge.at.federal law thus obliges drug manufacturers both and generic to monitor the safety of their products.
under federal law,generic manufacturers must develop written procedures for the surveillance,receipt,evaluation,and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experiences to the fda cfr b see also making applicable to generic manufacturers brief for united states as amicus curiae,and hereinafter brief.they must review all reports of adverse drug experiences received from any source.b.if a manufacturer receives a report of a serious and unexpected adverse drug experience,it must the event to the fda within days and must promptly investigate.c i ii see also tr.of oral arg.most other adverse drug experiences must be reported on a quarterly or yearly basis c.generic manufacturers must also submit to the fda an annual report summarizing significant new information from the previous year that might affect the safety,or labeling of the drug product,including a description of actions the manufacturer has taken or intends to take as a result of this new information.b i see also c.
generic manufacturers,the majority assumes,also bear responsibility under federal law for monitoring the adequacy of their warnings.i agree with the majority conclusion that generic manufacturers are not permitted unilaterally to change their labels through the cbe process or to issue additional warnings through dear doctor letters.see ante,at.according to the fda,however,that generic manufacturers can not disseminate additional warnings on their own does not mean that federal law permits them to remain idle when they conclude that their labeling is inadequate.fda regulations require that labeling be revised to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug.cfr e,currently codified at cfr e see also wyeth,at.the fda construes this regulation to oblige generic manufacturers to seek to revise their labeling and provide fda with supporting information about risks when they believe that additional warnings are necessary brief.
the manufacturers disagree.they read the fda regulation to require them only to ensure that their labels match the labels.see brief for petitioner pliva et.i need not decide whether the regulation in fact obliges generic manufacturers to approach the fda to propose a label change.the majority assumes that it does.and even if generic manufacturers do not have a duty to propose label changes,two points remain undisputed.first,they do have a duty under federal law to monitor the safety of their products.and,second,they may approach the fda to propose a label change when they believe a change is required.
this brings me to the manufacturers defense.state law obliged the manufacturers to warn of dangers to users.see hines remington arms,so,frey montgomery ward.the manufacturers contend,and the majority agrees,that federal law respondents claims because,under federal law,the could not have provided additional warnings to respondents without the exercise of judgment by the fda.i can not endorse this novel conception of impossibility.
two principles guide all analysis.first,the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every case.wyeth,at quoting medtronic,lohr.second,i n all cases,and particularly in those in which congress has legislated in a field which the states have traditionally occupied,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.wyeth,at quoting lohr,at some internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.
these principles find particular resonance in these cases.the states have traditionally regulated health and safety matters.see,at.notwithstanding congress certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation against drug manufacturers,wyeth,at,congress has not expressly tort actions against prescription drug manufacturers,whether or generic.to the contrary,when congress amended the fdca in to enlarg e the fda powers to protect the public health and assure the safety,effectiveness,and reliability of drugs,it took care to preserve state law.at quoting stat.see pub,stat.nothing in the amendments made by this act to the fdca shall be construed as invalidating any provision of state law which would be valid in the absence of such amendments unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such amendments and such provision of state law notably,although congress enacted an express provision for medical devices in,see pub,stat,a,it included no such provision in the amendments eight years later.wyeth,at.congress silence on the issue is powerful evidence that it did not intend fda oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effectiveness.at.
federal law impliedly state law when state and federal law conflict when it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal law or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.crosby national foreign trade council,internal quotation marks omitted.the manufacturers rely solely on the former ground of.
impossibility,we have emphasized,is a defense.wyeth,at.because is an affirmative defense,a defendant seeking to set aside state law bears the burden to prove impossibility.see silkwood.to prevail on this defense,a defendant must demonstrate that compliance with both federal and state law is a physical impossibility.florida lime avocado growers,paul,see also wyeth,at.in other words,there must be an inevitable collision between federal and state law.florida lime,at.the existence of a hypothetical or potential conflict is insufficient to warrant of state law.rice norman williams,see also gade national solid wastes management,kennedy,concurring in part and concurring in judgment.in other words,the mere possibility of impossibility is not enough.
the manufacturers contend that it was impossible for them to provide additional warnings to respondents and demahy because federal law prohibited them from changing their labels unilaterally they concede,however,that they could have asked the fda to initiate a label change.if the fda agreed that a label change was required,it could have asked,and indeed pressured,the manufacturer to change its label,triggering a corresponding change to the manufacturers generic thus,had the manufacturers invoked the available mechanism for initiating label changes,they may well have been able to change their labels in sufficient time to warn respondents.having failed to do so,the manufacturers can not sustain their burden at least not without further factual development to demonstrate that it was impossible for them to comply with both federal and state law.at most,they have demonstrated only a hypothetical or potential conflict.rice,at.
like the majority,the manufacturers focus on the fact that they can not change their labels unilaterally which distinguishes them from the defendant in wyeth.they correctly point out that in wyeth we concluded that the fda cbe regulation authorized the defendant to strengthen its warnings before receiving agency approval of its supplemental application describing the label change,at see also cfr c.but the defendant label change was contingent on fda acceptance,as the fda retained authority to reject labeling changes made pursuant to the cbe regulation.wyeth,at.thus,in the long run,a manufacturer compliance with a duty to warn required action by two actors the manufacturer had to change the label and the fda,upon reviewing the supplemental application,had to agree with the change the need for fda approval of the label change did not make compliance with federal and state law impossible in every case.instead,because the defendant bore the burden to show impossibility,we required it to produce clear evidence that the fda would not have approved a change to the label.ibid.
i would apply the same approach in these cases.state law,respondents allege,required the manufacturers to provide a strengthened warning about the dangers of metoclopramide use just like the manufacturer in wyeth,the manufacturers had available to them a mechanism for attempting to comply with their duty to warn.federal law thus accommodated the manufacturers duties.see ante,at.it was not necessarily impossible for the manufacturers to comply with both federal and state law because,had they approached the fda,the fda may well have agreed that a label change was necessary.accordingly,as in wyeth,i would require the manufacturers to show that the fda would not have approved a proposed label change.they have not made such a showing they do not argue that they attempted to give the kind of warning required by state law but were prohibited from doing so by the fda.wyeth,at.
this is not to say that generic manufacturers could never show impossibility.if a defendant proposed a label change to the fda but the fda rejected the proposal,it would be impossible for that defendant to comply with a duty to warn.likewise,impossibility would be established if the fda had not yet responded to a generic manufacturer request for a label change at the time a plaintiff injuries arose.a generic manufacturer might also show that the fda had itself considered whether to request enhanced warnings in light of the evidence on which a plaintiff claim rests but had decided to leave the warnings as is.the manufacturers make just such an argument in these cases.see,brief for petitioner actavis et.but these are questions of fact to be established through discovery.because the burden of proving impossibility falls on the defendant,i would hold that federal law does not render it impossible for generic manufacturers to comply with a duty to warn as a categorical matter.
this conclusion flows naturally from the overarching governing our doctrine.see supra,at.our respect for the states as independent sovereigns in our federal system leads us to assume that congress does not cavalierly causes of action.wyeth,at,quoting lohr,at.it is for this reason that we hold defendants asserting impossibility to a demanding standard.wyeth,at.this presumption against has particular force when the federal government has afforded defendants a mechanism for complying with state law,even when that mechanism requires federal agency action.the presumption has even greater force when federal law requires defendants to invoke that mechanism,as the majority assumes in these cases.in such circumstances,i would hold,defendants will usually be unable to sustain their burden of showing impossibility if they have not even attempted to employ that mechanism.any other approach threatens to infringe the states authority over traditional matters of state interest such as the claims here when congress expressed no intent to state law.
the majority concedes that the manufacturers might have been able to accomplish under federal law what state law requires.ante,at.to reach the conclusion that the manufacturers have nonetheless satisfied their to show impossibility,the majority invents a new rule the question for impossibility is whether the private party could independently do under federal law what state law requires of it.ante,at emphasis added.because the manufacturers could not have changed their labels without the exercise of judgment by the fda,the majority holds,compliance with both state and federal law was impossible in these cases 
the majority new test has no basis in our precedents.the majority cites only wyeth in support of its test.as discussed above,however,wyeth does not stand for the proposition that it is impossible to comply with both federal and state law whenever federal agency approval is required.to the contrary,label changes by manufacturers such as wyeth are subject to fda review and acceptance.see supra,at.and,even if wyeth could be characterized as turning on the fact that the manufacturer could change its label unilaterally,the possibility of unilateral action was,at most,a sufficient condition for rejecting the impossibility defense in that case.wyeth did not hold that unilateral action is a necessary condition in every case.
with so little support in our case law,the majority turns to other rationales.none of the rationales that it offers,however,makes any sense.first,it offers a reductio ad absurdum if the possibility of fda approval of a label change is sufficient to avoid conflict in these cases,it warns,as a logical conclusion so too would be the possibility that the fda might rewrite its regulations or that congress might amend the amendments.ante,at.the logic of this conclusion escapes me.conflict analysis necessarily turns on existing law.it thus would be ridiculous to conclude that federal and state law do not conflict on the ground that the defendant could have asked a federal agency or congress to change the law.here,by contrast,the manufacturers compliance with their duty to warn did not them to ask for a change in federal law,as the majority itself recognizes.see ante,at f ederal law would permit the manufacturers to comply with the state labeling requirements if,and only if,the fda and the manufacturer changed the label to do so the fda already afforded them a mechanism for attempting to comply with their duties.indeed,the majority assumes that fda regulations required the manufacturers to request a label change when they had reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug.cfr e.
second,the majority suggests that any other approach would render conflict illusory and ante,at.it expresses concern that,without a robust view of what constitutes conflict,the supremacy clause would not have any force except in cases of express.ibid.to the extent the majority purported concern is driven by its reductio ad absurdum,see ante,at,that concern is itself illusory,for the reasons just stated.to the extent the majority is concerned that our traditionally narrow view of what constitutes impossibility somehow renders conflict as a whole meaningless,that concern simply makes no sense we have repeatedly recognized that conflict may be found,even absent impossibility,where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.crosby,at internal quotation marks omitted see,geier american honda motor,barnett bank of marion,nelson,hines davidowitz.the majority expansive view of impossibility is thus unnecessary to prevent conflict from losing all meaning 
third,a plurality of the court adopts the novel theory that the framers intended for the supremacy clause to operate as a non obstante provision.see ante,at citing nelson,preemption.according to the plurality,non obstante provisions in statutes instruc t courts not to apply the general presumption against implied repeals.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted see also ante,at stating that when a statute contains a non obstante provision,courts will be less inclined against recognizing repugnancy in applying such statutes quoting sutherland,statutes and statutory construction.from this understanding of the supremacy clause,the plurality extrapolates the principle that courts should not strain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly conflicting state law.ante,at.
this principle would have been news to the congress that enacted the amendments in our precedents hold just the opposite.for more than half a century,we have directed courts to presume that congressional action does not supersede the historic police powers of the states unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.rice santa fe elevator,see also gade,at kennedy,concurring in part and concurring in judgment.we apply this presumption against both where congress has spoken to the question and where it has not.see wyeth,at.in the context of express,we read federal statutes whenever possible not to state law.see altria group,good,w hen the text of a clause is susceptible of more than one plausible reading,courts ordinarily accept the reading that disfavors quoting bates dow agrosciences llc,see also cipollone liggett group.and,when the claim is that federal law impliedly state law,we require a strong showing of a conflict to overcome the presumption that state and local regulation can constitutionally coexist with federal regulation.hillsborough county automated medical laboratories.
the plurality new theory of the supremacy clause is a direct assault on these precedents whereas we have long presumed that federal law does not,or repeal,state law,the plurality today reads the supremacy clause to operate as a provision instructing courts not to apply the general presumption against implied repeals.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.and whereas we have long required evidence of a clear and manifest purpose to,rice,at,the plurality now instructs courts to look no further than the ordinary meaning of federal law before concluding that congress must have intended to cast aside state law,ante,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
that the plurality finds it necessary to resort to this novel theory of the supremacy clause a theory advocated by no party or amici in these cases is telling.proper application of the longstanding presumption against compels the conclusion that federal law does not render compliance with s
