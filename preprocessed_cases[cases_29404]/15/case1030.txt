plaintiff carroll morris morris appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained demurrers to his second amended complaint without leave to amend.the complaint alleged a single cause of action under the unfair competition law ucl bus,against defendants redwood empire bancorp empire,national bank of the redwoods national,innovative merchant solutions innovative,and merchant systems merchant systems,challenging a fee charged by defendants upon termination of a credit card merchant account.in sustaining the demurrers,the trial court ruled the national bank act of bank act and associated regulations preempted morris unfair competition action.the court also ruled morris did not allege facts demonstrating empire liability.
although in the unpublished portion of this opinion we agree federal law does not preempt morris claims,we conclude the second amended complaint does not state a cause of action under the ucl.because the court sustained the demurrers of national,innovative,and merchant systems solely on federal preemption grounds,we reverse the judgment and remand to allow morris the opportunity to plead facts stating a cause of action under the ucl.because morris has failed to allege facts sufficient to state any cause of action against empire despite repeated attempts to do so,we affirm the trial court dismissal of that defendant.
allegations and procedural background 
morris is an elderly disabled man subsisting on social security benefits.in,he was persuaded to start a work at home business involving grocery coupons,and named the business.to process customers credit cards,morris obtained a merchant account.accordingly,he executed a merchant application provided by innovative,national registered agent.morris also executed a merchant agreement with national,again provided by innovative acting as the bank agent.
the merchant agreement provided that a discount rate would be charged for each credit card transaction and,if morris did not achieve a certain monthly transaction volume,the bank would assess a minimum processing fee.in addition,national charged morris a monthly customer service fee.the agreement continued indefinitely until terminated.either party could terminate the agreement with days notice without cause,or immediately under certain circumstances.although the bank could terminate the agreement without compensation to morris,termination by morris required payment of the minimum processing fee for the following period and a termination fee.the merchant agreement became effective in april.morris quickly concluded the coupon business was a scam,canceled the merchant agreement,and paid the termination fee.
morris filed the present action,alleging in his original complaint the termination fee constituted an illegal business practice under the ucl.specifically,he alleged the termination fee was a liquidated damages clause under civil code section,subdivision b,and void because the fee was unreasonable.morris sought relief for himself,and injunctive relief and restitution as a private attorney general on behalf of the general public.morris named as defendants national and national parent holding company,empire.
national and empire demurred.in response,morris filed a first amended complaint and attached portions of the merchant agreement,along with another merchant agreement used by national.the first amended complaint reiterated the contention the termination fee was an improper liquidated damages penalty,and also contended the fee was unconscionable under civil code section.national and empire again demurred,arguing the merchant agreement termination fee provision was not a liquidated damages provision,california courts should not use the ucl to regulate complex matters of economic policy,the ucl claim is preempted by the national bank act and associated regulations,and morris failed to allege liability against empire.the trial court sustained the demurrers with leave to amend,on preemption and the lack of allegations showing empire liability.shortly thereafter,morris filed his second amended complaint,to which demurrers were again filed and sustained on identical grounds.this time,however,the trial court did not grant leave to amend.
shortly before the hearing on the demurrers to the second amended complaint,morris added by doe amendment defendants innovative and merchant systems,registered agents of national,alleging they were parties to merchant agreements assessing the termination fee.innovative demurred to the second amended complaint on the same grounds as national and empire,and additionally argued it was not liable because it was a disclosed agent of national,and was not alleged to have acted tortiously.the trial court sustained innovative demurrers without leave to amend on the same grounds as those of national and empire.merchant systems had not yet filed any response to the second amended complaint.at the court suggestion,morris and merchant systems entered into a stipulation deeming merchant systems to have filed a demurrer on the same grounds as the other defendants.the trial court sustained these demurrers without leave to amend on the same grounds.

discussion 
a.the termination fee is not a liquidated damage under civil code section 
the ucl defines unfair competition to include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice bus.this language is intended to protect consumers as well as business competitors its prohibitory reach is not limited to deceptive or fraudulent acts,but extends to any unlawful business conduct.committee on children television,general foods cal d.by proscribing any unlawful business practice,section borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable,supra,cal th,d.in the second amended complaint,morris alleges the termination fee runs afoul of two statutes.specifically,he alleges the termination fee is an unreasonable liquidated damages provision in violation of civil code section,and is unconscionable under civil code section.
civil code section,subdivision b,provides in relevant part a provision in a contract liquidating the damages for the breach of the contract is valid unless the party seeking to invalidate the provision establishes that the provision was unreasonable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made.absent a relationship between the liquidated damages and the damages the parties anticipated would result from a breach,a liquidated damages clause will be construed as an unenforceable penalty.ridgley topa thrift loan cal th,d.the question whether a contractual provision is an unenforceable liquidated damages provision is one for the court.beasley wells fargo bank d,d beasley.although on demurrer a reviewing court ordinarily assumes as true the facts alleged in the complaint,a pleader legal characterization of a contract is not controlling,particularly when the contract is attached to the pleading.see barnett fireman fund ins.th,d.
the termination fee in the merchant agreement is not expressly denominated a liquidated damages provision.nonetheless,as morris correctly points out,to determine the legality of a provision,we examine its true function and operation,not the manner in which it is characterized in the contract.see garrett coast southern fed.sav.loan cal d,we have consistently ignored form and sought out the substance of arrangements which purport to legitimate penalties and forfeitures.the merchant agreement termination provision reads as follows any party may terminate this agreement at any time with or without cause by providing written notice to the other parties.however,if merchant terminates this agreement,bank and innovative shall have thirty days from date of receipt of the notice to delete merchant account during which time merchant shall remain liable for all fees and charges,including any monthly minimum processing charge and a termination fee of.
where a contract for a specified period of time permits a party to terminate the agreement before its expiration in exchange for a monetary payment,the payment is considered merely an alternative to performance,and not a penalty.see blank borden cal d,blank.in blank,the supreme court held a contract allowing a real property owner to terminate a listing agreement with a broker before its expiration upon the payment of a specified fee was not a liquidated damages provision because the fee was not triggered by a breach or default under the agreement.the court noted the contract presented the owner with a true option or alternative,as follows i f,during the term of an contract,the owner changes his mind and decides that he does not wish to sell the subject property after all,he retains the power to terminate the agent otherwise exclusive right through the payment of a sum certain set forth in the contract.id.at.
morris distinguishes the case on the ground the merchant agreement has no termination date.because the contract is of indefinite duration,morris contends the merchant cancellation is effectively a breach of the agreement.we are not persuaded.
although a contract characterization of a particular provision is not controlling,to constitute a liquidated damage clause the conduct triggering the payment must in some manner breach the contract.perdue illustrates this point.there,the plaintiff alleged a bank insufficient funds nsf fee,charged to the bank customer whenever the customer wrote a check in an amount exceeding available deposits,was a liquidated damages provision subject to the scrutiny of civil code section.in rejecting this contention,the court concluded,because the depositor has never agreed to refrain from writing nsf checks,the writing of such a check is not a breach of contract.perdue,supra,cal d at.
similarly,morris never agreed not to terminate the merchant agreement.indeed,the merchant agreement expressly allowed morris to terminate his performance at any time.morris notes the lack of any specified duration in the merchant agreement makes payment of the termination fee inevitable.but this very inevitability takes the provision out of the realm of liquidated damages,which by definition are assessed only upon a breach.a merchant seeking to open an account with national knows at some point he or she must pay the termination fee,and may,if desired,create a reserve against this liability.thus,the fee is merely a deferred charge attendant to initiating the account.
morris also argues the termination fee effectively operates as a liquidated damage when the merchant agreement is terminated upon an independent breach by the merchant,such as nonpayment of the minimum monthly service fee.this argument misses the point.it is the merchant termination of the agreement,by whatever means,that triggers the termination fee.because the agreement expressly allows the merchant to terminate at any time,imposition of the fee is not dependent upon any breach of contract and is therefore not a liquidated damage.
morris has not alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate unconscionability under civil code section 
as a separate and independent basis for the ucl claim,the complaint alleges the termination fee in the merchant agreement is unconscionable under civil code section.we conclude morris factual allegations fail to state an unconscionability claim 
civil code section,subdivision a,provides if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.the issue whether a contract provision is unconscionable is a question of law.flores transamerica homefirst,th,d flores.
although unconscionability is a mouthful to articulate,it is far more difficult to define.the doctrine has been described as because of its flexibility and insusceptibility to definition.steinhardt rudolph so d.indeed,civil code section does not define unconscionability,and at least one commentator observed that unconscionability is a concept incapable of exact definition.comment,commercial secrecy and the doctrine of unconscionability vindicated mary.the doctrine flexibility,however necessary to its use as a judicial safety valve to prevent gross injustice,creates the risk courts may intervene to deprive one contracting party of his or her bargain simply because the contractual obligations of the dissatisfied party proved more burdensome than originally anticipated.in an analogous context,our high court has observed courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair,supra,cal th at,d.an undefined standard of what is unfair fails to give businesses adequate guidelines as to what conduct may be challenged and thus enjoined and may sanction arbitrary or unpredictable decisions about what is fair or unfair,supra,cal th at,d.while constructing a precise definition of unconscionability may be difficult,certain identifiable factors,properly applied,narrow the scope of the doctrine.
in california,two separate approaches have developed for determining whether a contract or provision thereof is unconscionable.one,based upon the common law doctrine,was outlined by the california supreme court in graham,cal d,graham.under graham,the court first determines whether an allegedly unconscionable contract is one of adhesion upon making this finding,the court then must determine whether a the contract term was outside of the reasonable expectations of the weaker part y,or b was unduly oppressive or unconscionable.graham,at.
a separate test,based upon cases applying the uniform commercial code unconscionability provision views unconscionability as having procedural and substantive elements.a m produce fmc d.a m produce.the procedural element requires oppression or surprise.citation.oppression occurs where a contract involves lack of negotiation and meaningful choice,surprise where the allegedly unconscionable provision is hidden within a prolix printed form.citation.the substantive element concerns whether a contractual provision reallocates risks in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner.jones wells fargo bank th,d jones.under this approach,both the procedural and substantive elements must be met before a contract or term will be deemed unconscionable.both,however,need not be present to the same degree.a sliding scale is applied so that the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
our supreme court in perdue,supra,cal d,performed its unconscionability analysis exclusively under the graham approach,but noted the two analytical approaches are not incompatible,declaring both pathways should lead to the same result.id.at,fn.many years later in armendariz,the court approved both approaches without expressing a preference for either one.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.in the recent case of little auto stiegler,cal th,d,little,our high court employed exclusively the approach derived from a m produce.
each of the two approaches has generated some confusion in its application.for example,the graham approach commences with a determination of whether the contract is one of adhesion,thus fostering the impression that a nonadhesion contract may never be unconscionable.in harper ultimo th,d harper,however,we expressly recognized that a finding of adhesion was not a prerequisite to an unconscionability determination,and held unenforceable certain exculpatory provisions incorporated into,but not attached to,a nonadhesive contract.
similarly,under the procedural and substantive test of a m produce,courts often reflexively conclude the finding of an adhesion contract alone satisfies the procedural prong,and immediately move on to the subject of substantive unconscionability.see,flores,supra,th at,d a finding of a contract of adhesion is essentially a finding of procedural unconscionability.consequently,other procedural issues,including surprise,often are ignored when balancing or weighing procedural and substantive unconscionability.undue reliance on any one procedural factor to the exclusion of others may produce analytical myopia and obscure the larger unconscionability picture.this problem was recognized in california grocers bank of america th,d california grocers,where the court criticized the a m produce approach,noting to speak in terms of procedural unconscionability is to elevate the fact of adhesiveness,which is not per se oppressive,to the same level as substantive unconscionability,thus tending to obscure the real issue.california grocers,at,d.
nonetheless,the approach provides a useful framework when properly employed,and conforms more closely to cases decided under the section of the uniform commercial code,upon which california unconscionability statute is based.see perdue,supra,cal d at,fns.accordingly,we begin our analysis by considering the issue of procedural unconscionability with the following caveat in mind because procedural unconscionability must be measured in a sliding scale with substantive unconscionability,our task is not only to determine whether procedural unconscionability exists,but more importantly,to what degree it may exist.
procedural unconscionability concerns the manner in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties at that time.citation.it focuses on factors of oppression and surprise.citation.the oppression component arises from an inequality of bargaining power of the parties to the contract and an absence of real negotiation or a meaningful choice on the part of the weaker party.kinney united healthcare services,th,d kinney.
in armendariz the high court commenced its procedural unconscionability analysis by first determining whether the contract at issue was one of adhesion.following armendariz,we too begin our analysis of the merchant agreement by determining whether it is an adhesion contract.armendariz defines an adhesion contract as a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
in support of its legal conclusion the termination fee is part of an adhesion contract,the second amended complaint alleges a morris is unsophisticated,b the merchant agreement was a form contract imposed upon him,and c the termination fee provision was not negotiated.these allegations,which we must accept as true,demonstrate the merchant agreement was an adhesion contract as defined in armendariz.
our recognition of the merchant agreement as an adhesion contract,however,heralds the beginning,not the end,of our inquiry into its enforceability.to describe a contract as adhesive in character is not to indicate its legal effect a contract of adhesion is fully enforceable according to its terms citations unless certain other factors are present which,under established legal or to render it otherwise.perdue,supra,cal d at.
as noted above,courts sometimes equate adhesion with oppression in ruling that an adhesion contract is procedurally unconscionable although adhesion contracts often are procedurally oppressive,this is not always the case.see california grocers,supra,th at,d recognizing adhesiveness is not per se oppressive.oppression refers not only to an absence of power to negotiate the terms of a contract,but also to the absence of reasonable market alternatives.in madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,our state highest court recognized the point at which an adhesion contract becomes oppressive in many cases of adhesion contracts,the weaker party lacks not only the opportunity to bargain but also any realistic opportunity to look elsewhere for a more favorable contract he must either adhere to the standardized agreement or forego the needed service.id.at,italics added.conversely,the oppression factor of the procedural element of unconscionability may be defeated,if the complaining party has a meaningful choice of reasonably available alternative sources of supply from which to obtain the desired goods and services free of the terms claimed to be unconscionable.dean witter,supra,d at.
of course,not every opportunity to seek an alternative source of supply is realistic.courts have recognized a variety of situations where adhesion contracts are oppressive,despite the availability of alternatives.for example,a sick patient seeking admittance to a hospital is not expected to shop around to find better terms on the admittance form.see tunkl regents of university of california cal d.similarly,few employees are in a position to refuse a job because of an arbitration agreement in an employment contract.little,supra,cal th at,d.
in the present case,morris failed to allege he could not have obtained merchant credit card services from another source on different terms.moreover,unlike situations where the weaker party is under immediate pressure not to seek out alternative sources,morris was under no such compulsion in attempting to start his business.in a similar context,the court in west henderson d.west,rejected an unsophisticated tenant claim of oppression in entering into a commercial lease for a sandwich shop the only oppression on tenant we perceive in the circumstances surrounding the signing of the lease was.tenant was not in pursuit of life necessities this was a business venture.knowing her own inexperience,she signed the lease without consulting an attorney id.at.based on the allegations of morris second amended complaint,we are able to discern little oppression in the formation of the merchant agreement.
we next turn to the procedural element of surprise.as noted above,this element unfortunately has been given short shrift by several courts analyzing unconscionability under the a m produce framework.procedural surprise focuses on whether the challenged term is hidden in a prolix printed form or is otherwise beyond the reasonable expectation of the weaker party.see jones,supra,th at,d harper,supra,th at,d.
in the present case,the second amended complaint contains no allegations that morris was unaware of the fee when he executed the merchant agreement,or that its terms were misrepresented to him.in his brief,morris asserts the termination fee is buried in dense prose.we disagree.the termination fee provision is easily located in the third sentence under the large type heading article and effect of termination,and subheading term termination.
that a clear heading in a contract may refute a claim of surprise was recognized in woodside homes of,superior court th,d,which held enforceable an arbitration provision in a home sales contract.although the provision type style was small and did not stand out,a large type heading requiring the purchasers initials preceded it.id.at,d.based largely on the lack of surprise due to the heading,the court in woodside determined that even if the buyers had been provided no meaningful opportunity to negotiate the terms of the contract with the builder,there existed only a low level of procedural unconscionability.id.at,d.
the present case is distinguishable from provisions found to have surprised the weaker party.for example,in perdue,supra,cal d,the supreme court considered the effect of a bank charge,or nsf fee,for processing each check drawn on accounts lacking funds sufficient to cover the amount of the check.in concluding the plaintiff presented a triable issue of fact regarding unconscionability,the court considered the nsf fee provision became effective when the depositor opened a checking account and executed a signatu
