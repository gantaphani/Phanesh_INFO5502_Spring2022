by way of its petition for extraordinary relief defendant massachusetts mutual life insurance company mass mutual challenges the trial court order certifying as a plaintiffs class people who,over a course of years,purchased a particular type of life insurance product from mass mutual.we issued an order to show cause and have received a response from the plaintiffs and real parties in interest.
the product the plaintiffs purchased not only provided insurance coverage and a guaranteed return on accumulated premium,but also permitted plaintiffs to share in dividends which the company declared on a discretionary basis.in theory and as suggested by mass mutual agents in sales presentations,over time the principal amount of accumulated premiums would be large enough so that the amount of the discretionary dividend would pay the annual premium due on the policy.in the insurance industry these products are generically referred to as vanishing premium policies.mass mutual offered its customers what it called an n pay premium payment plan.
plaintiffs contend that at the time they purchased policies mass mutual was paying a discretionary dividend rate which mass mutual had no intention of maintaining.the plaintiffs believe they have evidence which shows mass mutual in fact developed plans to ratchet down its dividend over time.plaintiffs believe mass mutual failure to disclose to purchasers its own conclusions about its high discretionary dividend rate and its plans to lower the rate give rise to liability for violations of california unfair competition law bus,et ucl and consumers legal remedies act,et clra.
mass mutual contends plaintiffs claims are not suitable for class treatment because mass mutual believes that each plaintiff will be required to make an individual showing of the representation he or she received.we disagree.in order to establish liability for a nondisclosure under either the ucl or the clra,plaintiffs need not present individual proof that each class member relied on particular representations made by mass mutual or its agents.accordingly,we deny mass mutual petition.
discussion 
code of civil procedure section authorizes the maintenance of a class action when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.class treatment is permissible under code of civil procedure section when plaintiffs have established the existence of an ascertainable class and a community of interest.linder thrifty oil cal th,d.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.richmond dart industries,cal d.
a class action under the clra is governed exclusively by the terms of civil code section,rather than the more general provisions of code of civil procedure section.caro procter gamble th,fn,d caro hogya superior court d.however,civil code section,subdivision b,like code of civil procedure section,permits a class action only when there are questions of law or fact which predominate over questions affecting individual members.caro,supra,th at,d.

the leading case on what a plaintiff must establish in order to prevail on a statutory unfair trade practice claim is fletcher.in fletcher,a class representative alleged he and other customers of the defendant bank had been deceived by the bank practice of calculating per annum interest on the basis of a year.the bank argued class treatment was not appropriate because it believed its liability under the false advertising law,business and professions code section could not be established without individual proof as to the impact its activities had on each customer.fletcher,supra,cal d at.in rejecting the bank argument,the court stated o ur concern with thwarting unfair trade practices has been such that we have consistently condemned not only those alleged unfair practices which have in fact deceived the victims,but also those which are likely to deceive them.citations.id.at,italics added thus the court concluded that under the statute the court retains the authority to order restitution without an individualized showing on the knowledge issue if the court determines that such a remedy is necessary to prevent the use or employment of the unfair practice at issue in this case.id.at.
since fletcher was decided,our courts have not departed in any manner from the principle that liability for restitution under either the specific false advertising provisions of business and professions code section or the broader provisions of the ucl may be found without any individualized proof of deception and solely on the basis a defendant conduct was likely to deceive consumers.in committee on children television,general foods the court relied on this principle in finding that alleged misleading statements about the nature of sugared cereals were sufficient to maintain a ucl cause of action against cereal manufacturers.committee on children television,general foods,supra,cal d at.in an insurance coverage case,bank of the west,the court again relied on the principle that individualized proof of deception,reliance and injury are unnecessary under the ucl.the court found this aspect of the ucl demonstrated the important deterrent purpose of the statute and concluded the statute utility as a deterrent would be undermined if defendants were able to obtain insurance coverage for ucl claims.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
the court in day v.at t considered the issue in the context of plaintiffs who alleged the defendant practice of rounding up to the next full minute the charges incurred on prepaid phone cards was deceptive.in finding the practice was sufficient to support a claim for injunctive relief under the ucl,the court stated by their breadth,encompass not only those advertisements which have deceived or misled because they are untrue,but also those which may be accurate on some level,but will nonetheless tend to mislead or deceive a perfectly true statement couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or deceive the consumer,such as by failure to disclose other relevant information,is actionable under these sections.day v.at t,supra,th at,d.
in state farm fire casualty superior court the court considered allegations insurers had engaged in deceptive practices in altering the manner in which earthquake coverage was offered to consumers and in handling earthquake claims.state farm fire casualty th,d.in finding the insurers were subject to the remedies provided by the ucl,the court stated t he fraud contemplated by section bears little resemblance to common law fraud or deception.the test is whether the public is likely to be deceived.citation.this means that a section violation,unlike common law fraud,can be shown even if no one was actually deceived,relied upon the fraudulent practice,or sustained any damage.citation.no discussion is required to demonstrate that plaintiffs allegations regarding state farm allegedly fraudulent acts easily satisfy this test.id.at,d.
more recently in prata superior court the court found that a plaintiff could bring a representative action under the ucl against a bank which promised to provide consumers same as cash financing but in fact required installment payments.the bank argued the plaintiff was not a proper representative because his experience,which involved oral statements made by a stereo salesman,was unique.relying again on the principle that liability under the ucl depends upon whether a defendant practices are likely to deceive,the court rejected the bank contention as one which focused on individual matters of proof irrelevant to liability under the ucl.prata superior court,supra,th at,d.
given the wide variety of procedural and substantive contexts in which it has been applied,we are in no position to either abandon or ignore the principle set forth in fletcher that relief under the ucl,including restitution,is available without proof of individual deception,reliance and injury.rather,as the cases make clear,the power to impose a remedy under the ucl will arise whenever a defendant business practice is likely to deceive consumers.california ucl jurisprudence,to which we are clearly bound,distinguishes this case from the host of out of state authorities cited by mass mutual which have found vanishing premium claims are not suitable for class action treatment.none of the cases mass mutual has cited involve the ucl and its unique scope here the plaintiffs have presented evidence mass mutual withheld from its customers and agents its own view of the amount of discretionary dividend it was paying.a trier of fact could find mass mutual recognition that its dividend rate was excessive would have been important to prospective purchasers and that mass mutual failure to disclose its own conclusions was misleading.such a determination would in turn support a restitution order under the ucl.
the record here can be readily distinguished from the circumstances we confronted in south bay chevrolet general motors acceptance th,d south bay.in south bay the trial court made a factual finding that the defendant calculation of interest on a basis on financing the defendant provided to sophisticated automobile dealers was not likely to mislead the dealers and hence did not violate business and professions code section.we found substantial evidence to support the trial court finding and affirmed its judgment in favor of the defendant.south bay at,d.unlike the record in south bay,here there is not yet any factual finding members of the class were aware of mass mutual assessment of its discretionary dividends and its determination to lower them.
in this regard we note that mass mutual has presented evidence that it warned purchasers and agents that its dividend rate was likely to be reduced.plainly,the trial court will have to determine whether these warnings were sufficient under the ucl in light of what mass mutual had determined about its dividend rate.resolution of that question,which goes solely to the merits of plaintiffs claim,is not appropriate in determining whether a class should be certified.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d.
similarly,evidence mass mutual made annual dividend decisions based on advice it received from its actuaries and evidence that prospective purchasers received differing representations from mass mutual agents will not satisfy the requirements of the ucl.under the ucl the trial court will be required to determine whether the information mass mutual possessed should have been disclosed given the characteristics of the product the company was selling and other information it commonly provided policyholders.thus plaintiffs ucl claim presents common legal and factual issues which were plainly suitable for treatment as a class action.
the clra is set forth in civil code section et.unlike the ucl,under the clra a consumer may recover actual damages,punitive damages and attorney fees,subds.a,d.however,relief under the clra is limited to a ny consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or employment by any person of a method,act,or practice unlawful under the act,subd.a,italics added.as mass mutual argues,this limitation on relief requires that plaintiffs in a clra action show not only that a defendant conduct was deceptive but that the deception caused them harm.see caro,supra,th at,d.
contrary to mass mutual contention,the causation required by civil code section does not make the plaintiffs claims unsuitable for class treatment.causation as to each class member is commonly proved more likely than not by materiality.that showing will undoubtedly be conclusive as to most of the class.the fact a defendant may be able to defeat the showing of causation as to a few individual class members does not transform the common question into a multitude of individual ones plaintiffs satisfy their burden of showing causation as to each by showing materiality as to all.blackie barrack cir,fn.thus,i t is sufficient for our present purposes to hold that if the trial court finds material misrepresentations were made to the class members,at least an inference of reliance would arise as to the entire class.vasquez superior court cal d,see also occidental land,superior court cal d,varacallo.mut.life ins,finding causation in case provable on classwide basis.
in vasquez superior court,a representative plaintiff bought a fraud action on behalf of consumers who had purchased frozen food and freezers on installment contracts.the representatives alleged that,using a memorized script,the defendants had materially misrepresented the quality and value of the food and freezers the plaintiffs had agreed to purchase.with respect to reliance,the court stated the rule in this state and elsewhere is that it is not necessary to show reliance upon false representations by direct evidence.the fact of reliance upon alleged false representations may be inferred from the circumstances attending the transaction which oftentimes afford much stronger and more satisfactory evidence of the inducement which prompted the party defrauded to enter into the contract than his direct testimony to the same effect.citations.cal d at.
in occidental land,superior court,the plaintiffs brought a fraud action on behalf of purchasers of homes in a subdivision.they alleged that in a written estimate of the cost of maintenance of common areas and facilities,the defendant developer failed to include substantial costs the developer had subsidized.the court held that class treatment of claims growing out of the failure to disclose the subsidy was appropriate as we held in vasquez,an inference of reliance arises if a material false representation was made to persons whose acts thereafter were consistent with reliance upon the representation.that principle controls the present case.because the purchases made by plaintiffs were acts consistent with their reliance on the subdivision report,we conclude that the trial court did not err in inferring that justifia
