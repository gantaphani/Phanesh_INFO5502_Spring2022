in this case,we consider a certified question inquiring whether article x,section of the florida constitution,titled patients right to know about adverse medical incidents and also known as amendment,encompasses nursing homes.in tandem healthcare,benjamin,so d dca,the fourth district court of appeal certified this question to be of great public importance 
whether nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities fall within the definition of health care facility or health care provider as contemplated by amendment to the florida constitution 
id.at.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.we approve the decision of the fourth district and answer the certified question in the negative,finding that nursing homes do not fall within the definition of health care facility or health care provider in article x,section.
the fourth district described the unfortunate facts underlying this case 
jodi benjamin,as personal representative of the estate of marlene gagnon,sued tandem healthcare,a nursing home,for negligence resulting in the death of gagnon,a patient at the home.gagnon suffered cardiac failure and brain damage when food became lodged in her airway due to tandem alleged failure to serve her food in compliance with her treatment plan.benjamin requested that tandem produce all reports or records of any adverse medical incident involving gagnon,as provided by article x,section,of the florida constitution.benjamin also requested peer review documents and quality assurance records.
tandem healthcare,so d at.the trial court granted benjamin discovery request,and tandem healthcare appealed to the fourth district.the fourth district noted that the requested materials would normally be privileged as peer review and quality assurance records under florida law.id.benjamin argued,however,that those peer review and quality assurance privileges had been abrogated when florida voters approved article x,section of the florida constitution.
article x,section of the florida constitution was adopted in this provision,also referred to as amendment because of its numbering seventh on the november ballot,gave patients a right to have access to any records made or received in the course of business by a health care facility or provider relating to any adverse medical incident.art.x,a.const.it defines health care facility and health care provider as hav ing the meaning given in general law related to a patient rights and responsibilities.id.c.petitioner contends that nursing homes fall under this definition.
the fourth district concluded that article x,section,does not encompass nursing homes because section c of that provision defines the terms as having the meaning given in general law related to a patient rights and responsibilities.tandem healthcare,so d at.the fourth district read the term patient rights and responsibilities as a specific reference to section,florida statutes,titled florida patient bill of rights and responsibilities.in reaching this conclusion,the fourth district agreed with and relied upon the first district opinion in avante villa at jacksonville beach,breidert,so d dca,stating 
the petitioner in avante villa was a nursing home,and the order on review,as in this case,compelled discovery of documents which the nursing home claimed were privileged.the first d istrict concluded that the nursing home was not subject to the amendment.id.at.
the district court focused on the following language of article x,section the phrases health care facility and health care provider have the meaning given in general law related to a patient rights and responsibilities.art.x,c.const.emphasis added.it noted that while there are provisions of general law that include nursing homes within the meaning of health care facility or health care provider,only one statute deals with a patient rights and responsibilities,and that statute was section,enacted in.that was the only statute using that language at the time amendment was adopted.the court,therefore,concluded that the specific language in amendment requiring that the definition be related to a patient rights and responsibilities can be reasonably interpreted as adopting the definitions used in the florida patient bill of rights and responsibilities.id.at.
tandem healthcare,so d at.accordingly,the fourth district concluded that nursing homes were not encompassed by article x,section 
our review of this question of constitutional construction is de novo.zingale powell,so d.we begin by observing that the polestar of constitutional construction is voter intent.city of petersburg briley,wild,so d.we are obligated to give effect to the language of a constitutional amendment according to its meaning and what the people must have understood it to mean when they approved it.id.further,when interpreting a constitutional provision we must give effect to every provision and every part thereof.dep t of envtl.prot.millender,so d,e ach subsection,sentence,and clause must be read in light of the others to form a congruous whole so as not to render any language superfluous.ambiguity is an absolute prerequisite to judicial construction and when constitutional language is precise,its exact letter must be enforced.league of cities smith,so d.these foundational principles guide our analysis 
in interpreting a constitutional amendment,we begin with the amendment plain language.ervin collins,so d,we are called on to construe the terms of the constitution,an instrument from the people,and we are to effectuate their purpose from the words employed in the document.see also.soc y of ophthalmology.optometric ass n,so d,any inquiry into the proper interpretation of a constitutional provision must begin with an examination of that provision explicit language.as pointed out by both the first and fourth district courts of appeal,article x,section,defines health care facility and health care provider as having the meaning given in general law related to a patient rights and responsibilities.art.x.const.emphasis added.section is titled florida patient bill of rights and responsibilities.stat.emphasis added.the fourth district held that a plain reading of the amendment reflects its reference to section by its name.tandem healthcare,so d at.we agree.
again,as noted by the district courts,when amendment was enacted no other statute in florida used the phrase patient rights and responsibilities in its title.no other statute used that phrase in its text either.section,however,both used the phrase patient rights and responsibilities in its title and also contained definitions of the terms that article x was defining when it used the phrase patient rights and responsibilities.
the statement of purpose accompanying article x,section,also refers to section by name.the statement of purpose provides 
statement and purpose 
the legislature has enacted provisions relating to a patients bill of rights and responsibilities,including provisions relating to information about practitioners qualifications,treatment,and financial aspects of patient care.
in re advisory opinion to the re patients right to know about adverse med.incidents,so d,emphasis added.the emphasized text is a near exact recitation of the title of section.the provisions described in the statement and purpose section quoted above also refer to rights included in section it is clear that article x,section was drafted with the florida patient bill of rights and responsibilities,section,directly in mind.
as noted earlier in this opinion,the first district has also analyzed article x,section.see avante villa,so d.in avante villa,the first district held that article x,section,incorporated the definitions in section and that under those definitions,a nursing home was not a health care facility or health care provider.id.at.avante villa noted that section had been titled florida patient bill of rights and responsibilities since,over ten years prior to the adoption of article x,section.accordingly,the first district concluded that the reference in article x,section,to patient rights and responsibilities had to be deemed an intentional reference to the definitions contained in section.we agree.
finally,we n
