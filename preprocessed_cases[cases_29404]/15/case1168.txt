in this case we consider a question of law certified by the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit concerning the rights of a judgment creditor,the appellee federal trade commission ftc,regarding the respective ownership interests of appellants shaun olmstead and julie connell in certain florida limited liability companies llcs.specifically,the eleventh circuit certified the following question whether,pursuant to.stat,a court may order a to surrender all right,title,and interest in the debtor limited liability company to satisfy an outstanding judgment.fed.trade comm olmstead,cir.we have discretionary jurisdiction under article v,section b,florida constitution.
the appellants contend that the certified question should be answered in the negative because the only remedy available against their ownership interests in the llcs is a charging order,the sole remedy authorized by the statutory provision referred to in the certified question.the ftc argues that the certified question should be answered in the affirmative because the statutory charging order remedy is not the sole remedy available to the judgment creditor of the owner of a limited liability company.
for the reasons we explain,we conclude that the statutory charging order provision does not preclude application of the creditor remedy of execution on an interest in a llc.in line with our analysis,we rephrase the certified question as follows whether florida law permits a court to order a judgment debtor to surrender all right,title,and interest in the debtor limited liability company to satisfy an outstanding judgment.we answer the rephrased question in the affirmative.
background 
the appellants,through certain corporate entities,operated an credit card scam.olmstead,at.in response to this scam,the ftc sued the appellants and the corporate entities for unfair or deceptive trade practices.assets of these defendants were frozen and placed in receivership.among the assets placed in receivership were several florida llcs in which either appellant olmstead or appellant connell was the sole member.ultimately,the ftc obtained judgment for injunctive relief and for more than million in restitution.to partially satisfy that judgment,the ftc the appellants order compelling appellants to endorse and surrender to the receiver all of their right,title,and interest in their llcs.this order is the subject of the appeal in the eleventh circuit that precipitated the certified question we now consider.
ii.analysis 
in our analysis,we first review the general nature of llcs and of the charging order remedy.we then outline the specific relevant provisions of the florida limited liability company act llc act,chapter,florida statutes.next,we discuss the generally available creditor remedy of levy and execution under sale.finally,we explain the basis for our conclusion that florida law permits a court to order a judgment debtor to surrender all right,title,and interest in the debtor llc to satisfy an outstanding judgment.in brief,this conclusion rests on the uncontested right of the owner of the llc to transfer the owner full interest in the llc and the absence of any basis in the llc act for abrogating in this context the creditor remedy of levy and sale under execution.
nature of llcs and charging orders 
the llc is a business entity originally created to provide tax benefits akin to a partnership and limited liability akin to the corporate form.elf altochem north,jaffari.in addition to eligibility for tax treatment like that afforded partnerships,llcs are characterized by restrictions on the transfer of ownership rights that are related to the restrictions applicable in the partnership context.in particular,the transfer of management rights in an llc generally is restricted.this particular characteristic of llcs underlies the establishment of the llc charging order remedy,a remedy derived from the charging order remedy created for the personal creditors of partners.see city of arkansas city anderson,discussing history of partnership charging order remedy.the charging order affords a judgment creditor access to a judgment debtor rights to profits and distributions from the business entity in which the debtor has an ownership interest.
statutory framework for florida llcs 
the rules governing the formation and operation of florida llcs are set forth in florida llc act.in considering the question at issue,we focus on the provisions of the llc act that set forth the authorization for llcs,the characteristics of ownership interests,the limitations on the transfer of ownership interests,and the authorization of a charging order remedy for personal creditors of llc members.
section,florida statutes,provides that o ne or more persons may form a limited liability company.a person with an ownership interest in an llc is described as a member,which is defined in section as any person who has been admitted to a limited liability company as a member in accordance with this chapter and has an economic interest in a limited liability company which may,but need not,be represented by a capital account.the terms membership interest,member interest,and interest are defined as a member share of the profits and losses of the limited liability company,the right to receive distributions of the limited liability company assets,voting rights,management rights,or any other rights under this chapter or the articles of organization or operating agreement.stat.section provides that a n interest of a member in a limited liability company is personal property.
section contains provisions governing the a ssignment of member interest.under section,a limited liability company interest is assignable in whole or in part except as provided in the articles of organization or operating agreement.an assignee,however,has no right to participate in the management of the business and affairs of the llc except as provided in the articles of organization or operating agreement and upon obtaining approval of all of the members of the limited liability company other than the member assigning a limited liability company interest or upon c ompliance with any procedure provided for in the articles of organization or operating agreement.id.accordingly,an assignment of a membership interest will not necessarily transfer the associated right to participate in the llc management.such an assignment which does not transfer management rights only entitles the assignee to share in such profits and losses,to receive such distribution or distributions,and to receive such allocation of income,gain,loss,deduction,or credit or similar item to which the assignor was entitled,to the extent assigned.b.stat.
section is headed right of assignee to become member reiterates that an assignee does not necessarily obtain the status of member.section states unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or operating agreement,an assignee of a limited liability company interest may become a member only if all members other than the member assigning the interest consent.section sets forth the in the certified authorizes the charging order remedy for a judgment creditor of a member 
on application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a member,the court may charge the limited liability company membership interest of the member with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest.to the extent so charged,the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of such interest.this chapter does not deprive any member of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the member interest.
generally available creditor remedy of levy and sale under execution 
section,florida statutes,provides that various categories of real and personal property,including stock in corporations,shall be subject to levy and sale under execution.a similar provision giving judgment creditors a remedy against a judgment debtor ownership interest in a corporation has been a part of the law of florida since.see ch,laws of that shares of stock in any corporation incorporated by the laws of this state shall be subject to levy of attachments and executions,and to sale under executions on judgments or decrees of any court in this state.an llc is a type of corporate entity,and an ownership interest in an llc is personal property that is reasonably understood to fall within the scope of corporate stock.the general rule is that where one has any interest in property which he may alien or assign,that interest,whether legal or equitable,is liable for the payment of his debts.bradshaw am.advent christian home orphanage,so,quoting croom ocala plumbing electric,so.
at no point have the appellants contended that section does not by its own terms extend to an ownership interest in an llc or that the order challenged in the eleventh circuit did not comport with the requirements of section.instead,they rely solely on the contention that the legislature adopted the charging order remedy as an exclusive remedy,supplanting section.
creditor remedies against the ownership interest in a llc 
since the charging order remedy clearly does not authorize the transfer to a judgment creditor of all an llc member right,title and interest in an llc,while section clearly does authorize such a transfer,the answer to the question at issue in this case turns on whether the charging order provision in section always displaces the remedy available under section.specifically,we must decide whether section establishes the exclusive judgment creditor thus displaces section respect to a judgment debtor ownership interest in a llc.
as a preliminary matter,we recognize the uncontested point that the sole member in a llc may freely transfer the owner entire interest in the llc.this is accomplished through a simple assignment of the sole member membership interest to the transferee.since such an interest is freely and fully alienable by its owner,section authorizes a judgment creditor with a judgment for an amount equaling or exceeding the value of the membership interest to levy on that interest and to obtain full title to it,including all the rights of is,unless the operation of section has been limited by section.
section deals with the right of assignees or transferees to become members of an llc.section states the basic rule that absent a contrary provision in the articles or operating agreement,an assignee of a limited liability company interest may become a member only if all members other than the member assigning the interest consent.see also a.stat.the provision in section with respect to charging orders must be understood in the context of this basic rule.
the limitation on assignee rights in section has no application to the transfer of rights in a llc.in such an entity,the set of all members other than the member assigning the interest is empty.accordingly,an assignee of the membership interest of the sole member in a llc becomes a takes the full right,title,and interest of the the consent of anyone other than the transferor.
section recognizes the application of the rule regarding assignee rights stated in section in the context of creditor rights.it provides a special,a charging a creditor to seek satisfaction when a debtor membership interest is not freely transferable but is subject to the right of other llc members to object to a transferee becoming a member and exercising the management rights attendant to membership status.see.stat.setting forth general rule that an assignee shall have no right to participate in the management of the business affairs of an llc.
section provision that a judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of an llc interest simply acknowledges that a judgment creditor can not defeat the rights of nondebtor members of an llc to withhold consent to the transfer of management rights.the provision does not,however,support an interpretation which gives a judgment creditor of the sole owner of an llc less extensive rights than the rights that are freely assignable by the judgment debtor.see in re albright,rejecting argument that bankruptcy trustee was only entitled to a charging order with respect to debtor ownership interest in llc and holding that b ecause there are no other members in the llc,the entire membership interest passed to the bankruptcy estate in re modanlo,following reasoning of albright.
our understanding of section flows from the language of the subsection which limits the rights of a judgment creditor to the rights of an assignee but which does not expressly establish the charging order remedy as an exclusive remedy.the relevant question is not whether the purpose of the charging order,to authorize a special remedy designed to reach no further than the rights of the nondebtor members of the llc will a basis for implying an exception from the operation of that provision for llcs.instead,the question is whether it is justified to infer that the llc charging order mechanism is an exclusive remedy.
on its face,the charging order provision establishes a nonexclusive remedial mechanism.there is no express provision in the statutory text providing that the charging order remedy is the only remedy that can be utilized with respect to a judgment debtor membership interest in an llc.the operative language of section the court may charge the llc membership interest of the member with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest does not in any way suggest that the charging order is an exclusive remedy.
in this regard,the charging order provision in the llc act stands in stark contrast to the charging order provisions in both the florida revised uniform partnership act.stat,and the florida revised uniform limited partnership act.stat.although the core language of the charging order provisions in each of the three statutes is strikingly similar,the absence of an exclusive remedy provision sets the llc act apart from the other two statutes.with respect to partnership interests,the charging order remedy is established in section,which states that it provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a partner or partner transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor transferable interest in the partnership.stat.emphasis added.with respect to limited partnership interests,the charging order remedy is established in section,which states that it provides the exclusive remedy which a judgment creditor of a partner or transferee may use to satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor interest in the limited partnership or transferable interest.stat.emphasis added.
w here the legislature has inserted a provision in only one of two statutes that deal with closely related subject matter,it is reasonable to infer that the failure to include that provision in the other statute was deliberate rather than inadvertent.norman singer shambie singer,statutes and statutory construction ed.in the past,we have pointed to language in other statutes to show that the legislature knows how to accomplish what it has omitted in the statute we were interpreting.cason.dep t of mgmt.services,so d,see also horowitz plantation hosp,so d,rollins pizzarelli,so d.
the same reasoning applies here.the legislature has both the partnership statute and the limited partnership it knows how to make clear that a charging order remedy is an exclusive remedy.the existence of the express provisions in the partnership and limited partnership statutes therefore decisively undermines the appellants argument that the charging order provision of the llc does not contain such an exclusive remedy be read to displace the remedy available under section.
the appellants position is further undermined by the general rule that repeal of a statute by implication is not favored and will be upheld only where irreconcilable conflict between the later statute and earlier statute shows legislative intent to repeal.town of indian river shores richey,so d.we also have previously recognized the existence of a specific presumption against the s tatutory abrogation by implication of an existing common law remedy,particularly if the remedy is long established.thornber city of fort walton beach,so d.the rationale for that presumption with respect to common law remedies is equally applicable to the abrogation by implication of a statutory remedy.see schlesinger councilman,r epeals by implication are disfavored,and this canon of construction applies with particular force when the asserted repealer would remove a remedy otherwise available.quoting reg l rail reorganization act cases.here,there is no showing of an irreconcilable conflict between the charging order remedy and the previously existing judgment creditor remedy and therefore no basis for overcoming the presumption against the implied abrogation of a statutory remedy.
given the absence of any textual or contextual support for the appellants position,for them to prevail it would be necessary for us to rely on a presumption contrary to the presumption against implied is,a presumption that the legislative adoption of one remedy with respect to a particular subject abrogates by implication all existing statutory remedies with respect to the same subject.our law,however,is antithetical to such a presumption of implied abrogation of remedies.see richey thornber tamiami trails tours,city of tampa,so d.
in sum,we reject the appellants argument because it is predicated on an unwarranted interpretive inference which transforms a remedy that is nonexclusive on its face into an exclusive remedy.specifically,we conclude that there is no reasonable basis for inferring that the provision authorizing the use of charging orders under section establishes the sole remedy for a judgment creditor against a judgment debtor interest in llc.contrary to the appellants argument,recognition of the full scope of a judgment creditor rights with respect to a judgment debtor freely alienable membership interest in a llc does not involve the denial of the plain meaning of the statute.nothing in the text or context of the llc act supports the appellants position.
iii.conclusion 
section does not displace the creditor remedy available under section with respect to a debtor ownership interest in a llc.answering the rephrased certified question in the affirmative,we hold that a court may order a judgment debtor to surrender all right,title,and interest in the debtor llc to satisfy an outstanding judgment.
it is so ordered.
i can not join my colleagues in the judicial rewriting of florida llc act.make no mistake,the majority today steps across the line of statutory interpretation and reaches far into the realm of rewriting this legislative act.the academic community has clearly recognized that to reach the result of today majority requires a judicial rewriting of this legislative act.see,carter bishop daniel kleinberger,limited liability companies tax and business law,d discussing fact that statutes which do not contemplate issues with judgment creditors of llcs invite judicial invention carter bishop,reverse piercing a single member llc paradox,larry ribstein,reverse limited liability and the design of business associations,the situation in albright theoretically might seem to be better redressed through explicit application of traditional state remedies than by a federal court trying to shoehorn its preferred result into the state llc statute.the problem is that no state remedy is appropriate because the asset protection was explicitly permitted by the applicable statute.the appropriate solution,therefore,lies in fixing the statute.emphasis supplied thomas rutledge thomas earl geu,the albright an smllc is not an appropriate asset protection vehicle,bus.entities,at jacob stein,building stumbling blocks a practical take on charging orders,bus.entities,at.stating that the albright court ignored colorado law with respect to the applicability of a charging order where the statute does not exempt llcs from the charging order limitation.an adequate remedy is available without the extreme step taken by the majority in rewriting the plain and unambiguous language of a statute.this is extremely important and has impact because the principles used to ignore the llc statutory language under the current factual circumstances apply with equal force to multimember llc entities and,in essence,today decision crushes a very important element for all llcs in florida.if the remedies available under the llc act do not apply here because the phrase exclusive remedy is not present,the same theories apply to multimember llcs and render the assets of all llcs vulnerable.
i would answer the certified question in the negative based on the plain language of the statute and an in pari materia reading of chapter in its entirety.at the outset,the majority signals its departure from the llc act as it rephrases the certified question to frame the result.the question certified by the eleventh circuit requested this court to address whether,pursuant to section,a court may order a judgment debtor to surrender all right,title,and interest in the debtor limited liability company to satisfy an outstanding judgment.the majority modifies the certified question and fails to directly address the critical issue of whether the charging order provision applies uniformly to all limited liability companies regardless of membership composition.in addition,the majority advances a position with regard to chapter of the florida statutes that was neither asserted by the parties nor discussed in the opinion of the federal court.
despite the majority claim that it is not creating an exception to the charging order provision of the statute for llcs,its analysis necessarily does so in contravention of the plain statutory language and general principles of florida law.the llc act inherently displaces the availability of the execution provisions in chapter of the florida statutes by providing a remedy that is intended to prevent judgment creditors from seizing ownership of the membership interests in an llc and from liquidating the separate assets of the llc.in doing so,the llc act applies uniformly to multimember limited liability companies,and does not provide either an implicit or express exception that permits the involuntary transfer of all right,title,and interest in a llc to a judgment creditor.the statute also does not permit a judgment creditor to liquidate the assets of a llc in the manner allowed by the majority today.therefore,under the current statutory scheme,a judgment creditor seeking satisfaction must follow the statutory remedies specifically afforded under chapter,which include but are not limited to a charging order,regardless of the membership composition of the llc.
although this plain reading may require additional steps for judgment creditors to satisfy,an llc is a purely statutory entity that is created,authorized,and operated under the terms required by the legislature.this court does not possess the authority to judicially rewrite those operative statutes through a speculative inference not reflected in the legislation.the legislature has the authority to amend chapter to provide any additional remedies or exceptions for judgment creditors,such as an exception to the application of the charging order provision to llcs,if that is the desired result.however,by basing its premise on principles of law with regard to voluntary transfers,the majority suggests a result that can only be achieved by rewriting the clear statutory provisions.in effect,the majority accomplishes its result by judicially legislating section out of florida law.
for instance,the majority disregards the principle that in general,an llc exists separate from its owners,who are defined as members under the llc act.see defining member.stat.e ach limited liability company organized and existing under this chapter shall have the same powers as an individual to do all things necessary to carry out its business and affairs.in other words,an llc is a distinct entity that operates independently from its individual members.this characteristic directly distinguishes it from partnerships.specifically,an llc is not immediately responsible for the personal liabilities of its members.see litchfield asset mgmt.howell,overruled on other grounds by robinson coughlin.the majority obliterates the clearly defined lines between the llc as an entity and the owners as members.
further,when the legislature amended the llc requirements for formation to allow llcs,it did not enact other changes to the provisions in the llc act relating to an involuntary assignment or transfer of a membership interest to a judgment creditor of a member or to the remedies afforded to a judgment creditor.moreover,no other amendments were made to the statute to demonstrate any different application of the provisions of the llc act to and multimember llcs.for example,the llc act generally does not refer to the number of members in an llc within the separate statutory provisions.the legislature is presumed to have known of the charging order statute and other remedies when it introduced the llc statute.accordingly,by choosing not to make any further changes to the statute in response to this addition,the legislature indicated its intent for the charging order provision and other statutory remedies to apply uniformly to all llcs.this court should not disregard the clear and plain language of the statute.
in addition,the majority fails to correctly set forth the status of a member in an llc and the associated rights and interests that such membership entails.an owner of a florida llc is classified as a member,which is defined as 
any person who has been admitted to a limited liability company as a member in accordance with this chapter and has an economic interest in a limited liability company which may,but need not,be represented by a capital account.
stat.definitions emphasis supplied.therefore,to be a member of a florida llc it is now necessary to be admitted as such under chapter and to also maintain an economic interest in the llc.moreover,a member of an llc holds and carries a membership interest that encompasses both governance and economic rights 
membership interest,member interest,or interest means a member share of the profits and the losses of the limited liability company,the right to receive distributions of the limited liability company assets,voting rights,management rights,or any other rights under this chapter or the articles of organization or operating agreement.
stat.emphasis supplied.this provision was adopted during the amendments,which was after the modification to allow llcs.see ch,at,laws of.in stripping the statutory protections designed to protect an llc as an entity distinct from its owners,the majority obliterates the distinction between economic and governance rights by allowing a judgment creditor to seize both from the member and to liquidate the separate assets of the entity.
consideration of an involuntary lien against a membership interest must address what interests of the member may be involuntarily transferred.contrary to the view expressed by the majority,a member of an llc is restricted from freely transferring interests in the entity.for instance,because an llc is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its members,the specific llc property is not transferable by an individual member.in other words,possession of an economic and governance interest does not also create an interest in specific llc property or the right or ability to transfer that llc property.see.stat.stating that all property originally contributed to the llc or subsequently acquired is llc property see also bishop,supra.at discussing in context of federal tax liens the fact that t ypically,a member is not a and has no transferable interest in limited liability company property citing unif.liab.act.the specific property of an llc is not subject to attachment or execution except on an express claim against the llc itself.see bishop kleinberger,supra,d.
the interpretation of the statute advanced by the majority simply ignores the separation between the particular separate assets of an llc and a member specific membership interest in the llc.the ability of a member to voluntarily assign his,her,or its interest does not subject the property of an llc to execution on the judgment.under the factual circumstances of the present case,the trial court forced the judgment debtors to involuntarily surrender their membership interests in the llcs and then authorized a receiver to liquidate the specific llc assets to satisfy the judgment.in doing so,the trial court ignored the clearly recognized legal separation between the specific assets of an llc and a member interest in profits or distributions from those assets.see peoples credit first,llc,wl.may,ordering the appellants to endorse and surrender to the receiver,all of their right,title and interest in their unit certificates of the llcs for the receiver to liquidate the assets of these companies.the majority approves of this disregard by improperly applying principles of voluntary transfers to allow creditors of an llc member to attack and liquidate the separate llc assets.
additionally,the transfer of a membership interest is restricted by law and by the internal operating documents of the llc.although a member may freely transfer an economic interest,a member may not voluntarily transfer a management interest without the consent of the other llc members.see.stat.contrary to the view of the majority,in the context of a llc,the restraint on transferability expressly provided for in the statute does not disappear.unless admitted as a member to the llc,the transferee of the economic interest only receives the llc financial distributions that the transferring member would have received absent the transfer.see.stat.see also bishop kleinberger,supra,c.consequently,a member may cease to be a member upon the assignment of the entire membership interest,transferring all of the following share of the profits and losses of the llc,right to receive distributions of llc assets voting rights,management rights,and any other rights.see,c.stat.furthermore,a transferring member no longer qualifies under the statutory definition of member upon a transfer of the entire economic interest.see.stat.defining member as a person who has an economic interest in an llc.however,unless otherwise provided in the governing documents of the entity,the articles of incorporation and the operating agreement,the pledge or granting of a security interest,lien,or other encumbrance in or against,any or all of the membership interest of a member shall not cause the member to cease to be a member or to have the power to exercise any rights or powers of a member.c.stat.emphasis supplied.accordingly,a judgment or a charging order does not divest the member of a membership interest in the llc as the member retains governance rights.it only provides the judgment creditor the economic interest until the judgment is satisfied.
whether the llc act allows a judgment creditor of an individual member to obtain this entire membership interest to exert full control over the assets of the llc is the heart of the underlying dispute.neither the uniform limited liability company act nor the florida llc act contemplates the present situation in providing for llcs but restricting the transferability of interests.this problematic issue is not one solely limited to our state,though our decision must be based solely on the language and purpose of the florida llc act.thus,in my view,this court must apply the plain meaning of the statute unless doing so would render an absurd result.in contrast,the majority simply rewrites the statute by ignoring those inconvenient provisions that preclude its result.
legislative intent with regard to the rights of a judgment creditor of a member 
i understand the policy concerns of the ftc and the majority with the inherent problems in the transferability of both governance and economic interests under the llc act because the plain language does not contemplate the impact of a judgment creditor seeking to obtain the entire membership interest of a llc and to obtain the ability to liquidate the assets of the llc.the florida statute simply does not create a different mechanism for obtaining the assets of a llc as opposed to a multimember llc and,therefore,there is no room in the statutory language for different rules.
however,i decline to join in rewriting the statute with inferences and implications,which is the approach adopted by the majority.this court generally avoids judicial invention,as accomplished by the majority,when the statute may be construed under the plain language of the relevant legislative act.see bishop kleinberger,supra,d.in construing a statute,we strive to effectuate the legislature intent by considering first the statute plain language.see kasischke state,so d,citing borden ins,so d.when,as it is here,the statute is clear and unambiguous,we do not look behind the statute plain language for legislative intent or resort to rules of statutory construction to ascertain intent.daniels.dep t of health,so d.this is especially applicable in the instance of a business entity created solely by state statute.
if the statute had been written as the majority suggests here,i would agree with the result requested by the ftc.however,the underlying conclusion lacks statutory support.by reading only provisions of the statute to support this result,the majority disregards the remainder of the llc act,which destroys the isolated premise that the charging order provision only applies to multimember llcs and that other statutory restrictions do not exist.
additionally,exceptions not found within the statute can not simply be read into the statute,as the majority does by holding that llcs are an implicit exception to the charging order provision.the remedy provided to the ftc by the federal district court and approved by the majority in this a judgment creditor of a llc is entitled to receive a surrender and transfer of the full right,title,and interest of the judgment debtor and to liquidate the llc not provided for under the plain language of the llc act without judicially writing an exception into the statute.
judgment creditor can charge the debtor member interest in the llc with payment of the unsatisfied judgment 
as a construct of statutory creation,an llc is an entity separate and distinct from its members,and thus the liability of the llc is not directly imputed to its members.in a similar manner,the liability of individual members is not directly imposed separately upon the llc.
although a member interest in an llc is considered to be personal property,see.stat,and personal property is generally an asset that may be levied upon by a judgment creditor under florida law,see.stat,there are statutory restrictions in the llc context.any rights that a judgment creditor has to the personal property of a judgment debtor are limited to those provided by the applicable creating statute.
the appellants contend that if a judgment creditor may seek satisfaction of a member personal debt from a llc,the plain language of the llc act limits the judgment creditor to a charging order.see.stat.a charging order is a statutory procedure whereby a creditor of an individual member can satisfy its claim from the member interest in the limited liability company.see black law dictionary ed defining term in the context of partnership law.it is understandable that the ftc challenges the charging order concept being deemed a remedy for a judgment creditor because,from the creditor perspective,a charging order may not be as attractive as just seizing the llc assets.for example,a creditor may not receive any satisfaction of the judgment if there are no actual distributions from the llc to the judgment creditor through the economic interest.see elizabeth schurig amy jetel,a shocking revelation fact or fiction a charging order is the exclusive remedy against a partnership interest,probate property,at.the preferred creditor remedy would be a transfer and surrender of the membership interest that is subject to the charging order,which is a more permanent remedy and may increase the creditor chances of having the debt satisfied.see id.
the application of the charging order provision,including its consequences and implications,has been hotly debated in the context of both partnership and llc law because of the similarities of these entities.the language of the charging order provision in the revised uniform limited partnership act,as amended in,is virtually identical to that used in the uniform limited liability company act,as well as in the florida llc act.see.stat.the uniform limited partnership act of significantly changed this provision by explicitly allowing execution upon a judgment debtor partnership interest.see schurig jetel,supra,at.however,the florida partnership act provides that a charging order is the exclusive remedy for judgment creditors.see.stat.stating the charging order provision provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a partner or partner transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor transferable interest in the partnership.in the context of partnership interests,florida courts have also determined that a charging order is the exclusive remedy for judgment creditors based on the straightforward language of the statute.see givens loan investors,so d,dca holding that charging order is the exclusive remedy for a judgment creditor of a partner myrick second bank of clearwater,so d,dca substantially similar.the florida llc act has neither adopted an explicit remedy nor does it include a provision explicitly stating that the charging order is the exclusive remedy of the judgment creditor.the plain language of the charging order provision only provides one remedy that a judgment creditor may choose to request from a court and that the court may,in its discretion,choose to impose.see.stat.
to support its conclusion that charging orders are inapplicable to llcs,the majority compares the provision in the partnership statute that mandates a charging order as an exclusive remedy to the provision in the llc act.the exclusivity of the remedy is irrelevant to this analysis.by relying on an inapplicable statute,the majority ignores the plain language of the llc act and the other restrictions of the statute,which universally apply the use of a charging order to judgment creditors of all llcs,regardless of the composition of the membership.the majority opinion now eliminates the charging order remedy for multimember llcs under its theory of nonexclusivity which is a disaster for those entities.
plain meaning of the statute actual language 
the charging order provision does not act as a shield against the creditors of a member.instead,the llc act implements statutory restrictions on the transfer and assignment of membership interests in an llc.these restrictions limit the mechanisms available to a judgment creditor of a member of any type of llc to obtain satisfaction of a judgment against the membership interest.specifically,section grants a court of competent jurisdiction the discretion to enter a charging order against a member interest in the llc in favor of the judgment creditor 
right of assignee to become member.
unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or operating agreement,an assignee of a limited liability company interest may become a member only if all members other than the member assigning the interest consent.
an assignee who has become a member has,to the extent assigned,the rights and powers,and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities,of the assigning member under the articles of organization,the operating agreement,and this chapter.an assignee who becomes a member also is liable for the obligations of the assignee assignor to make and return contributions as provided in and wrongful distributions as provided in.however,the assignee is not obligated for liabilities which are unknown to the assignee at the time the assignee became a member and which could not be ascertained from the articles of organization or the operating agreement.
if an assignee of a limited liability company interest becomes a member,the assignor is not released from liability to the limited liability company under ss,and.
on application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a member,the court may charge the limited liability company membership interest of the member with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest.to the extent so charged,the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of such interest.this chapter does not deprive any member of the benefit of any exemption 
stat.emphasis supplied.
the majority asserts that the placement of the charging order provision within the section titled right of assignee to become member mandates that the provision only applies to circumstances where the interest of the member is subject to the rights of other llc members.there is absolutely nothing to support the notion that the legislature placement of the charging order provision as a subsection of section,instead of as a separately titled section elsewhere in the statute,was intended to unilaterally link its application only to the multimember context.for instance,the revised uniform limited liability company act,unlike the florida statute,places the charging order provision as a separately titled section within the article that discusses transferable interests and rights of transferees and creditors.see unif.liab.act revised.other states have also adopted a statutory scheme that places the charging order remedy within a separate provision specifically dealing with the rights of a judgment creditor.see.thus,the majority interpretation would again fail by a mere movement of the charging order provision to a separately titled section within the act.
in contrast to the majority,my review of this provision begins with the actual language of the statute.in construing a statute,it is our purpose to effectuate legislative intent because legislative intent is the polestar that guides a court statutory construction analysis.see polite state,so d,citing bautista state,so d,quoting state,so d.a statute plain and ordinary meaning must be given effect unless doing so would lead to an unreasonable or absurd result.see city of miami beach galbut,so d.here,the plain language establishes a charging order remedy for a judgment creditor that the court may impose.this section provides the only mechanism in the entire statute specifically allocating a remedy for a judgment creditor to attach the membership interest of a judgment debtor.in the multimember context,the uncontested,general rule is that a charging order is the appropriate remedy,even if the language indicates that such a decision is within the court discretion.see myrick,so d at.as the second district explained 
rather,the charging order is the essential first step,and all further proceedings must occur under the supervision of the court,which may take all appropriate actions,including the appointment of a receiver if necessary,to protect the interests of the various parties.
id.at.without express language to the contrary,the discretionary nature of this remedy applies with equal force to multimember llcs,which the majority erases from the statute.
nevertheless,the certified question before us is not the discretionary nature of this remedy but whether a court should even apply the charging order remedy to llcs.the majority rephrases the question certified to this court as not considering whether an exception to the charging order provision should be implied for llcs.in doing so,the majority unjustifiably alters and recasts the question posited by the federal appellate court to fit the majority result.the convoluted alternative presented by the majority is premised on a limited application of a charging order without express language in the statutory scheme to support this assertion.
here,the plain language crafted by the legislature does not limit this remedy to the multimember circumstance,as the majority holds.further,exceptions not made in a statute generally can not be read into the statute,unless the exception is within the reason of the law.see cont l assurance carroll,so d,this court can not grant an exception to a statute nor can we construe an unambiguous statute different from its plain meaning.dobbs sea isle hotel,so d,we apprehend that had the legislature intended to establish other exceptions it would have done so clearly and unequivocally we can not write into the law any other exception.thus,without going behind the plain language of the statute,at first blush,the statute applies equally to all llcs,regardless of membership composition.
the distinction asserted by the ftc is clearly inconsistent with the plain language of section with regard to the proper method for a judgment creditor to reach the interest of a member in a llc in that a complete surrender of the membership interest and the subsequent liquidation of the llc assets are not contemplated by the llc act.the majority interpretation that the charging order remedy only applies to multimember llcs can only be given effect if the plain language of this provision renders an absurd result,which it does not.
the purpose of creating the charging order provision was never limited to the protection of innocent members of an llc.moreover,when amending the llc act to permit llcs,the legislature did not also amend the assignment of interest and charging order provisions to create different procedures for multimember llcs.the appellants argue that this indicates a manifestation of legislative intent however,it appears more likely that our legislature,as with many other states,had not yet contemplated the situation before us.even so,the appropriate remedy in this circumstance is not for this court to impose its speculative interpretation,but for the legislature to amend the statute to reflect its specific intention,if necessary.when interpreting a statute that is unambiguous and clear,this court defers to the legislature authority to create a new limitation and right of action.here,the actual language of the statute does not distinguish between the number of members in an llc.thus,the charging order applies with equal force to both and multimember llcs,and the assignment provision of section does not render an absurd result.
the majority purports to base its analysis on the plain language of the statute.however,the ftc and a multitude of legal theorists agree that the plain language of the statute does not support this result.see,bishop kleinberger,supra,d bishop,supra.at ribstein,supra.at rutledge geu,supra,bus.entities,at stein,supra,bus.entities,at.all authorities recognize that the sole way to achieve the result desired by the ftc and the majority is to ignore the plain language of the statute.no external support exists for the majority bare assertions.
rights of an assignee 
the plain language of section applies the charging provision to the judgment creditor of both a and multimember llc.the next analytical step is to determine what rights that charging order provision grants the judgment creditor.to the extent that a membership interest is charged with a judgment,the plain text of the statute specifically provides that the judgment creditor only possesses the rights of an assignee of such interest.see.stat.to the extent so charged,the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of such interest.
to determine the rights of an assignee of such an interest,we look to section,which defines these rights.to divine the intent of the legislature,we construe related statutory provisions together,or in pari materia,to achieve a consistent whole that gives full,harmonious effect to all related statutory provisions.see heart of adoptions,so d,quoting forsythe longboat key beach erosion control,so d.the ftc asserts that the rights delineated in this section render an absurd result when applied to llcs however,the ftc ignores that the same rule applies even if only a part of a member interest is needed to satisfy a debt amount.further,an assignee is entitled solely to an economic interest and is not entitled to governance rights without the unanimous approval of the other members or as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or the operating agreement.
the plain reading of this provision does not establish the judgment creditor as an assignee of such interest,only that to the extent of the judgment amount charged to the economic interest,the judgment creditor has the same rights as an assignee.though section directs that the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of su
