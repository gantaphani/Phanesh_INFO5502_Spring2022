the complaint 
plaintiff and appellant jennifer gallivan sued to recover telephone charges she alleged were imposed fraudulently and in breach of contract by defendants and respondents att according to gallivan complaint,respondents are local telephone companies that provide telecommunications services and products in california.gallivan is a customer of at t,and included in her monthly bill from at t is a network access charge of for interstate calls.this charge is sometimes referred to as a subscriber line charge slc.gallivan alleged that respondents deceived their customers by advertising a monthly service charge that did not include the slc and then including the slc on the bill labeled as an amount imposed by the fcc.she alleged that this falsely represented to the public that the slc was collected by the fcc,when in truth the amount was neither mandated by the fcc nor passed through respondents to the fcc.rather,the slc paid by appellant was retained by respondents.according to gallivan,respondents were not authorized by the fcc to assess the slc.gallivan sought to represent a class of all california customers of at t who were charged the slc.
on behalf of the class,gallivan asserted causes of action for breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and fraud by concealment,and sought recovery of all funds paid for the slc,plus costs and interest 
the demurrer 
respondents demurred to the complaint,asserting several grounds the claims were barred by the federal filed rate doctrine the claims were preempted by federal law and the claims were insufficiently pled.alternatively,respondents requested that the matter be referred to the fcc for determination under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.
the parties do not dispute that the slc was part of a rate tariff that respondents had filed with the fcc.respondents argued that because the slc is an charge for an interstate telecommunications service,it is not an overcharge or a component of the local rate.they further asserted that under the filed rate doctrine,customers may not bring an action against a telephone company that would invalidate,alter,or add to the terms of an approved tariff.as such,respondents asserted that no cause of action for breach of contract,unjust enrichment or fraud had been stated against them.
in opposition,appellant argued that the filed rate doctrine should have no application because respondents had never been subject to tariffing requirements regarding the slc,that the doctrine did not apply to state law claims for fraud and misrepresentation,that her state law claims did not conflict with federal law and were therefore not preempted,and that she had adequately pled her claims.appellant also argued that the matter should not be referred to the fcc because resolution of her state law claims would not require any specialized agency expertise.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that the claims were barred by the filed rate doctrine because monetary damages were sought in the form of a rebate.as an additional ground,the court found that the contract and fraud claims were insufficiently pled.this appeal followed.

the filed rate doctrine 
the filed rate doctrine,also referred to as the filed tariff doctrine,is a rule that derives from the requirements of the federal communications act of.under the act,a common carrier is required to file with the fcc and keep open for public inspection schedules also known as tariffs showing all charges and showing the classifications,practices,and regulations affecting such charges.a.under this doctrine,once a carrier tariff is approved by the fcc,the terms of the federal tariff are considered to be the law and to therefore conclusively and exclusively enumerate the rights and liabilities as between the carrier and the customer.not only is a carrier forbidden from charging rates other than as set out in its filed tariff,but customers are also charged with notice of the terms and rates set out in that filed tariff and may not bring an action against a carrier that would invalidate,alter or add to the terms of the filed tariff.evanns v.at t cir.
the filed rate doctrine has two primary purposes preventing carriers from engaging in price discrimination as between ratepayers the nondiscrimination strand and preserving the exclusive role of federal agencies in approving rates for telecommunications services that are reasonable by keeping courts out of the process the nonjusticiability strand,a function that the federal regulatory agencies are more competent to perform.marcus v.at t marcus cir.thus,the filed rate doctrine bars not only lawsuits challenging filed rates or seeking to enforce rates different from the filed rates,but also lawsuits challenging services,billing or other practices when the challenge,if successful,would effectively result in a modification of the filed tariff through the award of damages.day v.at t th,d brown mci worldcom network services,cir.there is no question that the doctrine has been used repeatedly to bar myriad claims seeking monetary recovery.day,supra,th at,d.
application of the filed rate doctrine to a voluntarily filed tariff 
appellant argues that the filed rate doctrine should have no application in today modern competitive telecommunications market,and that it is particularly inapplicable to a tariff that is not required to be filed by the fcc,like the at t tariff here,or to a nonmandatory provision in the tariff,such as assessment of the slc.to better understand appellant arguments,it is necessary to place them in historical context.
the filed rate doctrine was originally created during the railroad era to curb monopolistic railroad companies.verizon delaware covad communications cir.the doctrine passed from transportation law to communications law through the requirement in the federal communications act of a.verizon delaware,supra,at.at that time,at t enjoyed a virtual monopoly over the nation telephone service industry and t he act was intended to address the unique problems inherent in a monopolistic environment.ting v.at t cir.
according to the ninth circuit in verizon delaware covad communications,supra,at page t he doctrine as applied to telecommunications was dealt a body blow by the telecommunications act of codified as interspersed amendments to the act.responding to the desires of the federal communications commission and believers in the free market,congress gave the fcc broad authority to forbear from regulation where the fcc determined that it was not necessary to assure just,reasonable,nondiscriminatory charges or otherwise to protect consumers and further determined that forbearance was consistent with the public interest.a.armed with this authority,the fcc began a massive program of deregulation in favor of regulation by the market,supplemented by remedies.ibid ting v.at t,supra,at.
the fcc acted to forbear from applying the tariff filing requirements by imposing mandatory detariffing on nondominant long distance carriers for their interstate,domestic,and long distance services.concluding that tariffs were not necessary to ensure that their rates,practices,classifications and regulations are just and reasonable and not discriminatory,the fcc required these carriers to cancel their tariffs.see second and order at,wl.the fcc noted that detariffing in the long distance marketplace would eliminate the ability of carriers to invoke the filed rate doctrine,which would serve the public interest by preserving reasonable commercial expectations and protecting consumers.id.at,wl.as the ting court pointed out,d uring the course of implementing the act,the fcc stated on a number of occasions that one of the major purposes of detariffing was to eliminate the filed rate doctrine and its harmful effects on customers.ting v.at t,supra,at.t he filed rate doctrine now functions in the telecommunications field as an anomaly.it is a relic,open to repudiation by the fcc.verizon delaware covad communications,supra,at.
the telecommunications act of recognizes two types of entities that offer local basic telephone service incumbent local exchange carriers ilec,the existing regulated companies in a given service territory h,and competitive local exchange carriers clec,the new entrants to the local telephone markets.it is undisputed that respondents are clec,which offer local telephone service to the public in competition with ilec and other clec throughout california.
appellant alleged in her complaint that only ilec are permitted to charge the slc.she has since conceded that clec are not prohibited from charging an slc but she argues that because clec like respondents are not required to file tariffs with the fcc respondents should not be protected by the filed rate doctrine.
respondents concede that they are not required to file a tariff or to charge the slc.but respondents point out that clec remain fully authorized to file tariffs with the fcc that include an slc respondents also point out that they have not been subject to detariffing,and they argued to the court below that all local telephone companies have tariffs on file with the fcc.while appellant does not dispute that respondents have not been subject to detariffing she points to the fcc statement that it has,in many instances,chosen not to regulate the rates charged by competitive lecs,including slcs.
there appear to be no cases addressing the issue of whether the filed rate doctrine applies to a permissive charge in a voluntarily filed tariff.but courts have regularly applied the doctrine to bar claims for monetary relief regardless of whether the fcc has specifically directed or simply allowed the filing of the disputed tariff provision.see,evanns v.at t,supra,dismissing under the filed rate doctrine customer state law claims relating to collection of a tariffed universal service charge that was not mandated to be passed through to customers and bryan bellsouth communications,cir directing dismissal of customer state law claim under filed rate doctrine even though the fcc permits but does not mandate carrier to assess and tariff universal service charge.
in marcus v.at t,supra,the court rejected the argument that the filed rate doctrine should be modified to allow nondisclosure claims in light of the increasingly competitive telecommunications market.the marcus court noted that in response to a similar argument to modify the filed rate doctrine in light of changed circumstances,the supreme court explained that while it had considerable sympathy to such arguments,such considerations address themselves to congress,not to the courts.id.at,quoting mci telecommunications american telephone telegraph,d.the marcus court stated like the supreme court,we too are sympathetic to the argument that,at least in the telecommunications industry,strict adherence to the filed rate doctrine is no longer required.but absent congressional authorization or direction from the supreme court,we are in no position to modify the doctrine.marcus v.at t,supra,at.
we agree.where there is a valid tariff on file with the fcc,we feel constrained to apply the filed rate doctrine in the absence of definitive authority to the contrary.in reaching our conclusion,we do not lightly reject appellant argument that the filed rate doctrine should not apply where no tariff is required to be filed.the fact that the fcc does not require clec to file tariffs demonstrates a reluctance on the part of the fcc to regulate the industry.where an entity is not regulated because it is not required to file its rates with the fcc for approval by that agency,there appears to be little justification for the doctrine.arkansas louisiana gas hall,d filed rate doctrine forbids a regulated entity to charge rates for its services other than those properly filed with the appropriate federal regulatory authority emphasis added.we agree that the purposes served by the filed rate doctrine,to preserve the fcc role in the ratemaking process and to ensure rate uniformity,would serve no purpose in an industry with no uniform,filed rates approved by the fcc.spielholz superior court th,d.
on the other hand,we can not ignore that the fcc does,in fact,permit clec to file tariffs and to assess consumers an slc.where such rates are on file with the fcc,they remain subject to the exclusive authority of that agency to accept or challenge them.this allows the fcc to ensure that slc rates are uniform and consistent and not discriminatory.a consumer remains protected to the extent the rate charged conforms to the rate filed because a different rate can be challenged in the courts or with the fcc.cahnmann sprint cir,duggal capital communications services,th,d.
of course,we recognize that in implementing the telecommunications act of and authorizing the fcc to forbear from regulation and from imposing the tariff filing requirement,congress intended to replace the old regulatory scheme with one based on market competition in which consumers would be protected in part by state law.ting v.at t,supra,at.but unlike mandatory detariffing applicable to nondominant long distance carriers,the fcc has not taken steps to prohibit clec from filing tariffs.under these circumstances,elimination of the filed rate doctrine is more appropriately a matter for federal action.
appellant argument that respondents have voluntarily filed the tariff in order to immunize themselves from california consumer protection laws and from liability for breach of contract and fraud goes too far.as discussed above,to the extent appellant claims sought only injunctive relief,the trial court properly found that such claims would not be barred by the filed rate doctrine.moreover,to the extent a plaintiff claims seek damages that do not impact the filed rate,such a claim would also be allowed to proceed.see,lovejoy v.at t th,d where plaintiff claimed carrier slammed his number and he lost business as a result.
we find that the filed rate doctrine is applicable here.
appellant claim for damages violates the filed rate doctrine 
the trial court concluded that appellant contract,unjust enrichment and fraud claims were barred by the filed rate doctrine because each sought monetary damages,the net effect of which would be to award a rebate,thereby resulting in a different rate paid by some,though not all,at t customers.appellant contends this finding was erroneous because her complaint does not allege that the rates defendants charged are inconsistent with the rates filed with the fcc,or that the rates are excessive in light of the services actually provided rather,she claims that defendants,fraudulently failed to disclose,in their advertised rate and promotional material,that their rates included the slc,and in their billing materials fraudulently misrepresented the slc as a federally imposed charge,which it is not.while this is an accurate reading of her complaint,appellant ignores the fact that she seeks monetary damages in the form
