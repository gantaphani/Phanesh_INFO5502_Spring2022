the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa delimits the proper venues in which a debt collector may bring a legal action to collect on a consumer debt.in pertinent part,the fdcpa venue provisions require that such actions be brought only in the judicial district or similar legal entity in which the consumer resides at the commencement of the action.a b.here,cohen slamowitz llp c s brought a debt collection action against jonathan hess in syracuse city court.hess obtained the dismissal of that action pursuant to section of new york uniform city court act on the basis that he did not reside in the city of syracuse or a town contiguous thereto.hess then brought suit against c s in federal court alleging that c s violated the fdcpa venue provisions by suing him in syracuse city court.he appeals from the district court dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim.
this case calls upon us to decide a question of first impression in this circuit whether a debt collector violates the fdcpa venue provisions by suing a consumer in a city court in the state of new york when that court lacks power to hear the action because the consumer does not reside in that city or a town contiguous thereto.we hold that such a suit is not brought in the judicial district or similar legal entity in which the consumer resides,even when the consumer resides elsewhere within the county containing the city court,and therefore determine that hess complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
hess complaint contains the following,nonconclusory factual allegations,which we must accept as true for purposes of this appeal from the district court grant of a motion to dismiss.see,harrington cnty.of suffolk,cir.
hess is a resident of the town of clay,which is located in onondaga county,new york.hess lived in clay at all times relevant to this action,and during that time,never lived,worked,or maintained a place of business in the city of syracuse,new york.syracuse also is located in onondaga county,but clay and syracuse are not contiguous by land.
c s,a woodbury,new limited liability partnership,is a debt collector within the meaning of the fdcpa.in april,c s sued hess in syracuse city court on behalf of an entity called midland funding llc midland.midland complaint,which was signed by c s,alleged that midland was the to hsbc,to which hess owed plus interest in credit card debt.the complaint also alleged that midland was a foreign limited liability company and that,upon information and belief,hess resides or has an office in the county in which this action is brought,or that hess transacted business within the county in which this action is brought and the instant cause of action arose out of said transaction.app.hess was served with a summons and this complaint at his home in clay.
hess then hired an attorney at a cost of.through this attorney,hess moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction based on section of new york uniform city court act because none of the parties resided in syracuse or a town that was contiguous thereto by land.in connection with that motion,hess provided evidence that midland is a delaware limited liability company with its place of business in california.midland did not object to the dismissal of the action without prejudice to its recommencing the suit in the proper court,and the syracuse city court granted that relief by letter dated july.
in august,pursuant to the fdcpa civil liability provisions,hess brought suit against c s in the united states district court for the northern district of new york,alleging that c s violated the fdcpa venue provisions by suing him in a judicial district in which he did not reside.c s moved to dismiss hess complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the district court granted this motion on two alternative grounds.first,the district court looked to the common law within the second circuit to conclude that the fdcpa term judicial district meant county.second,the district court stated that dismissal was warranted because it ha d difficulty concluding that c s act of bringing suit in syracuse city court was intended to be unfair,harassing,and deceptive,and because even if this act were so intended,adopting hess interpretation of the venue provisions would,in the district court view,impose undue restrictions on ethical debt collectors.hess cohen slamowitz,llp,wl,at.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal for failure to state a claim harrington,at.
congress enacted the fdcpa to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors,to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged,and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.e.among the abusive practices that congress intended the fdcpa to address was the problem of forum abuse,an unfair practice in which debt collectors file suit against consumers in courts which are so distant or inconvenient that consumers are unable to appear,hence permitting the debt collector to obtain a default judgment,at,reprinted in.as a result,congress adopted venue provisions to ensure that a debt collector who files suit does so either where the consumer resides or where the underlying contract was signed.id.
these provisions,codified in,state in pertinent part 
any debt collector who brings any legal action on a debt against any consumer shall 
bring such action only in the judicial district or similar legal entity 
a in which such consumer signed the contract sued upon or 
b in which such consumer resides at the commencement of the action.
here,it is undisputed that c s is a debt collector and that hess is a consumer,and c s makes no claims regarding the location where the contract sued upon was signed.the sole disputed issue on appeal is whether c s brought suit in the judicial district or similar legal entity where hess resided as of the commencement of the action.
where,as here,we are called upon to interpret the meaning of a federal statute,we look first to the language of the statute itself.marvel characters,simon,cir.when the language of a statute is unambiguous,judicial inquiry is complete.id.quoting.bank germain.in conducting this inquiry,we review the statutory text,considering the ordinary or natural meaning of the words chosen by congress,as well as the placement and purpose of those words in the statutory scheme.dobrova holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we begin by considering the meaning of the term judicial district.the word district has been defined to mean a territorial division as of a nation,state,county,or city marked off or defined for administrative,electoral,judicial,or other purposes.webster third new international dictionary accord black law dictionary ed defining district to mean a territorial area into which a country,state,county,municipality,or other political subdivision is divided for judicial,political,electoral,or administrative purposes.similarly,at the time the fdcpa was enacted,black law dictionary defined the phrase judicial district as 
one of the circuits or precincts into which a state is commonly divided for judicial purposes a court of general original jurisdiction being usually provided in each of such districts,and the boundaries of the district marking the territorial limits of its authority or the district may include two or more counties,having separate and independent county courts,but in that case they are presided over by the same judge.
newsom friedman,cir quoting black law dictionary ed,and noting that previous editions contained the same definition.from these definitions,it is clear that congress meant the phrase judicial district to refer to some territorial subdivision of the courts,but we are still left with the task of identifying which of the multitude of such subdivisions among the nation various court systems establishes the pertinent boundary as applied to the facts of a particular case.
the parties here assume that when the underlying debt collection action is brought in state court,the term judicial district must be determined with respect to the court system of that,new opposed to the federal court system.we agree.the fdcpa applies to debt collection actions brought in state as well as federal courts.see d even where abusive debt collection practices are purely intrastate in character,they nevertheless directly affect interstate commerce.we see no indication in the text of that congress might have intended the term judicial district to refer to the judicial districts of the federal court system even when the debt collection action is brought in state court.such a reading would be contrary to the fdcpa purpose of eliminating abusive debt collection practices involving the state courts,including forum abuse,where federal judicial districts tend to be much larger than correlative state units,dutton wolhar.we thus join the other courts that have considered this issue to conclude that the term judicial district,as applied to debt collection actions,must be defined in accordance with the judicial system of the state in which the debt collection action is brought.see,newsom,at fox citicorp credit,cir dutton.at.
our inquiry next turns to the structure of new york state court system.c s contends that the term judicial district or similar legal entity refers to the county in which the consumer resides or in which the contract was signed county subdivisions are indeed relevant to new york state court system,and in particular,to new york court of general original jurisdiction the supreme court.the supreme court is a single court of statewide jurisdiction,with a branch in each county.david siegel,new york practice ed hereinafter practice.new york civil practice law and rules cplr contains venue requirements applicable to actions brought in the supreme court.these requirements support c s interpretation insofar as they generally provide that the place of trial shall be in the county in which one of the parties resided when it was commenced and,with respect to actions arising out consumer credit transactions,provide that the place of trial shall be the residence of a defendant.cplr a,f 
c s,however,did not sue hess in the onondaga county branch of the supreme court rather,it brought suit in the city court for the city of syracuse.every city in new a city court,which is a court of limited original jurisdiction over,inter alia,civil actions involving or less in monetary damages.see const.art.vi,uniform city.act.while new york uniform city court act the ucca does not include any provisions that are specifically labeled as relating to venue,the article of the ucca entitled jurisdiction contains a section specifying requirements that the parties reside or do business within or near the city containing the court.this provision,section of the ucca,states 
in an action for the recovery of money damages,either a plaintiff or a defendant must 
be a resident of the city or of a town contiguous to such city,provided that such town is 
i within the same county,and 
ii contiguous to the city by land,or 
have a regular employment within the city or 
have a place for the regular transaction of business within the city.
ucca a as noted,hess successfully obtained dismissal of the suit against him in on the basis that none of the parties had regular employment or a place for the regular transaction of business in syracuse,and that clay,where hess resides,is not contiguous by land to syracuse.
against this background,we are called upon to determine whether the statutory term judicial district should be defined with reference to the territorial limits of the syracuse city court,or whether that term refers to a broader subdivision,such as the county of hess residence.the logical first step in resolving this question is to consider the nature of the territorial subdivisions of the court system in which the debt collector brought suit.see newsom,at.because the court system of which c s availed itself is governed by laws that limit the territorial extent of those courts based on,inter alia,a defendant contacts with the forum,we hold that those laws delimit the judicial district by which compliance with the fdcpa venue provisions must be measured.we thus conclude that the fdcpa term judicial district,as applied to a case where a debt collector sues a consumer in one of new york state city courts,extends no farther than the boundaries of the city containing that court and the towns within the same county that are contiguous by land thereto.because the proper judicial district here does not include the town where hess resides,we hold that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint 
while c s offers a number of arguments in support of its position that judicial district should encompass the entire county of the consumer residence even when a consumer is sued in a city court,we are unpersuaded.first,c s argues that the dismissal of its lawsuit,on consent,does not give rise to a violation of the fdcpa venue provisions because section is addressed to the issue of jurisdiction,which c s contends is irrelevant to the fdcpa venue analysis.we concede that this argument has a certain superficial appeal,as purposes of venue requirements often differ from those of jurisdictional requirements.as we have observed in a different context,w hereas issues of jurisdiction relate to the basic authority of a court to hear and decide a case,venue,by contrast,is in the nature of a convenience to litigants and subject to their disposition.gonzales,cir.thus,if the syracuse city court had dismissed c s lawsuit because of jurisdictional limitations that did not relate to the territorial nexus between the consumer and the example,if c s had demanded damages in excess of the limited jurisdictional amount that can be recovered in a city would be to claim that the fdcpa venue provisions were violated.
it is far from clear,however,that section is properly characterized as jurisdictional in this sense.while section is codified in the ucca under an article entitled jurisdiction,it also provides in subsection d that t he requirements of this section shall not be deemed jurisdictional insofar as that term implies that they can not be waived by the parties.elsewhere in its brief,c s characterizes section as akin to a forum non conveniens provision,in that courts can choose to not hear a case solely because the case lacks sufficient local contacts to the court.appellee br.at citing david siegel,practice commentary,ucca mckinney section is a kind of forum non conveniens provision in that it can eject a case even though the court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the defendant person.the objection is waivable,which takes it out of the category of subject matter jurisdiction,which it might otherwise fit.and even assuming that section is properly characterized as jurisdictional or,it does not follow from this label that the provision lacks relevance to the fdcpa venue analysis.the fdcpa venue requirements restrict debt collectors from suing on debts in judicial district s that are remote from where the consumer lives or where the underlying contract was signed.similarly,section ensures that at least one of the parties has a territorial nexus to the city where the court is located.where,as here,a state law outlines the required nexus between the residence or activities of the consumer and the location of the court,we hold that such a law sets forth the appropriate judicial district for purposes of the fdcpa with respect to debt collection actions brought in that court,regardless of whether that provision is styled as jurisdictional or otherwise.
c s also asserts that the dismissal here should not give rise to a fdcpa violation because section provides that actions dismissed thereunder may be refiled in the appropriate court.ucca d citing cplr.this is significant,according to c s,because if a debt collection case is dismissed under section based on the consumer,the debt collector will either abandon the case or refile in a jurisdiction that
