plaintiff webster bivens appeals the judgment of dismissal entered against him after a demurrer to his complaint for declaratory and equitable relief based on causes of action for false advertising and unfair business practices under business and professions code sections,and,brought by defendant gallery corporation,dba mattress gallery,a delaware corporation gallery or defendant,was sustained without leave to amend in addition to contending the trial court erred in sustaining gallery demurrer on the three causes of action he alleged under provisions of california unfair competition law et,ucl and the false advertising act et,bivens asserts proposition,which was passed by the voters of california on november,shortly before the court ruled on the demurrer and which narrowed the class of persons who can maintain actions under the ucl and the false advertising act,should not be applied retroactively to preclude him from bringing his causes of action.recognizing this court has previously held applies to ucl and false advertising actions filed before its effective date of november,which are not yet final on appeal and the issue of retroactivity is pending before our supreme court in those cases as well as in other court of appeal cases bivens requests we grant him leave to amend his complaint to meet the new standing requirements if we maintain our view that applies to such existing causes of action.
we conclude,consistent with our previous positions,that applies to this action and,as a result,bivens lacks standing under sections and,which were amended by,to pursue this action as pled.we deny bivens request to amend his complaint to try to satisfy the requirements of because the trial court correctly determined as a matter of law no cause of action under sections,or had been or could be pled we,therefore,find the court properly sustained gallery demurrer to bivens complaint without leave to amend and affirm the judgment of dismissal.
factual and procedural history 
according to the pleadings,bivens is a senior citizen residing in san diego entitled to calendar preference,subd.b,subd.f code civ,who is unaffected by gallery conduct and bringing this action under the ucl on behalf of the general public pursuant to and.bivens alleges that on or about december,february and,and june,gallery published an advertising supplement in the los angeles times depicting an image of a woman on a mattress and an advertisement for mattresses to the right of the image.the advertisement states pricing starting as low as in large type.in smaller print it states twin ea.pc.in substantially smaller type,in parenthesis,it states sold in sets only.bivens alleges the failure to give the total price for twin sets,when read in conjunction with the unit price,is likely to mislead consumers.in addition,he alleges the failure to define what constitutes a set is likely to mislead consumers.copies of the advertisements are attached to the complaint as exhibits a,b,c,and bivens alleged gallery refused to sell to their retail customers any single twin mattress or box spring referred to herein for the advertised unit price.
in his first cause of action,bivens alleged a violation of section,incorporating the above allegations and further claiming o n one or more occasions,defendants advertised the unit price for merchandise that defendants sold,at that unit price,only in multiple units,without stating the price that the consumer must pay for the minimum quantity of merchandise sold as a multiple unit offer.
in his second cause of action,bivens alleged a violation of section,incorporating all earlier allegations and further claiming o n one or more occasions defendants advertised merchandise,including mattresses,in a manner that would lead an average reasonable consumer to believe that one could purchase a unit of merchandise at the unit price stated in the advertisements.it was untrue,and therefore misleading,that defendants would sell a single twin size mattress or box spring at the advertised price.bivens additionally alleged that a s part of a plan or scheme,on one or more occasions defendants advertised merchandise,specifically mattresses,in a manner that would lead an average reasonable consumer to believe that he could purchase a unit of the items offered in the advertisements,with the intent not to sell such merchandise at the prices stated therein.
in his third cause of action,bivens alleged a violation of section,incorporating all the above allegations and further claimed d efendants have engaged in unfair competition in that they have engaged in acts or practices that are unlawful acts or practices that are unfair acts or practices that violate chapter commencing with of part,of division,of the business and professions code and have utilized unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.this conduct is actionable,and thereby unlawful pursuant to.
bivens then specifically alleged that the unlawful acts and practices by gallery were 
defendants violated section,as explained fully above in the first cause of action i n order to obtain the mattresses at the advertised unit price,a consumer must purchase a set of mattresses,which contains two pieces.the advertising of the single mattress is false or otherwise untrue,in that defendants will not sell a single twin mattress at the advertised price,thereby constituting unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising that is likely to mislead a reasonable member of the consuming public defendants utilized the advertising techniques throughout california,exemplified by exhibits a through d,which are likely to mislead and confuse the consuming public as to the price of the advertised product payable at the store and defendants published the advertisement stating the sale price for mattresses at a single unit price,while intending to not sell the advertised merchandise as advertised,to wit individually at the price for twin size mattresses,in violation of the consumer legal remedies act,civil code,et,at a and business and professions code.
bivens prayed for a declaratory judgment that gallery was using unlawful advertising techniques and that such unlawful advertising provided gallery with an unfair competitive advantage over its competitors.bivens also asked for the appointment of a receiver to conduct an accounting of amounts gallery had received due to its unlawful advertising and to supervise restitution to any identifiable customers who had paid more than the advertised prices for purchases of the advertised mattresses,for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,for attorney fees under the substantial benefit doctrine,as well as costs and investigative expenses.
gallery demurred to bivens complaint on grounds there was no violation of section as alleged in the first cause of action and with regard to the second and third causes of action there was no violation of any other statute and nothing false and misleading about the advertisements which would confuse a reasonable consumer who would know exactly what he or she was able to buy and for what price.gallery asserted the complaint should be dismissed in its entirety without leave to amend because bivens could not amend it to allege facts to support the ucl or false advertising causes of action based on the advertisements which were proper as a matter of law.gallery also filed a request the court take judicial notice of the legislative history of section.bivens opposed the motion and request for judicial notice.
on november,the trial court issued a tentative ruling,stating 
defendant gallery demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to all three causes of action alleged in the complaint based on violations of sections.as a matter of law,the subject advertisement gives adequate notice of the price of the sets available for purchase.a set as advertised for sale does not constitute multiple units within the meaning of section.the subject advertisement does not contain any false or misleading statements in violation of section.the subject advertisement does not contain any unfair,deceptive,untrue,or misleading advertising in violation of section because the advertisement states the minimum price per piece and notifies reasonable consumers that the sale price only applies to sets.
after hearing oral argument,the court took the matter under submission.on november,the court confirmed its earlier tentative as the final ruling on gallery demurrer.on february,the court issued a final order and judgment of dismissal in favor of gallery.

negates bivens standing to pursue his ucl and false advertising claims 
which was approved by the voters in the november general election,amended certain sections of the ucl,sections et,and the false advertising act,sections et.as relevant here,specifically amended sections and to inject a standing requirement for actions under these related laws.as so amended,section now reads in relevant part actions for any relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted exclusively by or upon the complaint of any board,officer,person,corporation or association or by any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.italics added.amended section now reads in pertinent part actions for injunction under this section may be prosecuted by or upon the complaint of any board,officer,person,corporation or association or by any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of a violation of this chapter.any person may pursue representative claims or relief on behalf of others only if the claimant meets the standing requirements of this section and complies with section of the code of civil procedure.italics added.these statutes,as amended,prevent unaffected plaintiffs from being able to file actions on behalf of the general public.under current law,only persons who have been injured in fact and have lost money or property as a result of the alleged unfair competition or false advertising have standing to bring actions for relief under the ucl and the false advertising act.
although was effective at the time of the court december ruling on gallery demurrer cal,art.ii,subd.a,neither the court nor the parties mentioned such amendment with regard to gallery motion.as bivens notes in his opening brief,the issue of whether applies to cases not yet final is pending in numerous cases before our supreme court.see ante,fns.and.relying on mcclung employment development department cal th,d,mcclung and arguments of statutory interpretation,vested property rights,substantive effect and federal law,bivens contends does not apply to existing causes of action such as his filed before its passage.he impliedly concedes,however,that if we agree with the position this court has taken on the issue,finding that applies to pending cases filed before became effective,he would not have standing to bring his causes of action as pled.if such is our determination,he requests we grant him leave to amend to meet the new standing requirements.
consistent with the already mentioned cases on review from this court,we also determined in huntingdon life sciences,stop huntingdon animal cruelty usa,th,d huntingdon that applies to cases filed before its effective date.id.at,d.we have reconsidered our reasoning for so holding in huntingdon in light of bivens arguments and continue to adhere to such rationale.although huntingdon concerned a cause of action for unfair competition alleged only under section et,the same reasoning regarding applicability to pending cases applies as well to causes of action for false advertising brought under section et because it,like section et,provides a purely statutory remedy which was repealed by without a savings clause.see huntingdon,supra,th at,d.
contrary to bivens reliance on mcclung,t he repeal of a statutory right or remedy presents entirely distinct issues from that of the prospective or retroactive application of a statute.a line of authority holds the unconditional repeal of a special remedial statute without a savings clause stops all pending actions where the repeal finds them.if final relief has not been granted before the repeal goes into effect it can not be granted afterwards,even if a judgment has been entered and the cause is pending on appeal.the reviewing court must dispose of the case under the law in force when its decision is rendered.citations.citations.physicians committee for responsible medicine tyson foods,th,d,italics omitted see also younger superior court cal d,callet alioto cal,callet.
the justification for this rule is that all statutory remedies are pursued with full realization that the legislature may abolish the right to recover at any time.callet,supra,cal.at,see also,any statute may be repealed at any time,except when vested rights would be impaired.persons acting under any statute act in contemplation of this power of repeal.because it is a creature of statute,the right of action exists only so far and in favor of such person as the legislative or initiative power may declare.citation.unlike a common law right,a statutory remedy does not vest until final judgment.citation.huntingdon,supra,th at,d.
because the complaint in huntingdon showed that one of the individual plaintiffs had sustained damage to real and personal property,we found she had standing under amended section to proceed individually with her unfair competition cause of action.huntingdon,supra,th at,d.to the extent the complaint also alleged she was representing the general public,we found she could not do so without complying with the class action certification procedures of code of civil procedure as required by amended sections and.ibid.
here,unlike the individual plaintiff in huntingdon,bivens has not alleged any injury in fact and loss of money or property as a result of unfair competition false or misleading advertising,which is required now to show standing to prosecute the ucl claims in his complaint.nor has he made any allegations necessary under code of civil procedure section to represent a class of plaintiffs,which he would be unable to do in light of his admission in the complaint that he is an unaffected plaintiff.see.amending his complaint to plead otherwise would directly conflict with this admission and would not be allowed to avoid the defect in standing.see freeman san diego ass of realtors th,fn,d.thus as applied to this case which is not final,deprives bivens of standing to pursue his causes of action as pled in his complaint.
unless the complaint could be amended by substituting a party who has standing to sue for bivens on the same set of facts and advertisements,bivens lack of standing due to applying to this case creates a nonwaivable,jurisdictional defect which is itself grounds for dismissal of bivens action.see cloud northrop grumman th,d see also klopstock superior court of san francisco cal d.bivens has not suggested any way in which the complaint could be amended to state a claim based on its alleged facts and the attached advertisements.only if those facts and advertisements provided viable claims would we find the trial court had abused its discretion to permit bivens to attempt to amend the complaint to substitute in a real party in interest who has injury in fact to satisfy the new standing requirements.however,as we explain below,the trial court properly found bivens could not state causes of action under sections,or based upon the attached advertisements.consequently,the claims bivens raised in the complaint fail as a matter of law and there remain no claims for a new plaintiff to pursue.it would therefore be futile and improper to grant bivens leave to amend the complaint.
the advertisements at issue do not support ucl or false advertising causes of action 
even if bivens had standing to pursue this action,we conclude he has not,and can not,as a matter of law state a cause of action under sections,or based on the advertisements attached as exhibits to the complaint.we address each cause of action in turn.
a.the first cause of action under section 
bivens specifically argues the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the first cause of action by reading section too narrowly to limit it to single goods sold only in multiple units.we disagree.
section provides in relevant part 
a any corporation engaged in business in this state as a retail seller who sells any consumer good or service which is sold only in multiple units and which is advertised by price shall advertise those goods or services at the price of the minimum multiple unit in which they are offered.b nothing contained in subdivision a shall prohibit a retail seller from advertising any consumer good or service for sale at a single unit price where the goods or services are sold only in multiple units and not in single units as long as the advertisement also discloses,at least as prominently,the price of the minimum multiple unit in which they are offered.c for purposes of subdivisions a and b,consumer good means any article which is used or bought for use primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,but does not include any food item.e for purposes of subdivisions a and b,retail seller means a corporation which engages in the business of selling consumer goods or services to retail buyers.
generally,t he court role in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law and,in doing so,the court looks first to the words of the statute.citation.kraus trinity management services,cal th,d.if the language of the subject statute is clear and unambiguous,judicial construction is not necessary and a court should not indulge in it.citation.ibid.however,i f the language is ambiguous,we may look to the history and background of the statute to ascertain legislative intent.citation.ibid.such extrinsic evidence of the legislature intent,includes the ostensible public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citations.people woodhead cal d.
here we need not indulge in such judicial construction of section as we conclude its language is clear and unambiguous that the phrase multiple units refers to a consumer good or service which is sold in a quantity of more than one of the same kind of good or service.this interpretation comports with the usual,ordinary meaning of the terms used in section.multiple is defined in the american heritage dictionary as h aving,pertaining to or consisting of more than one individual,element,part,or other component.american heritage dict.new college ed.such dictionary defines unit as.measurement.a precisely specified quantity in terms of which the magnitudes of other quantities of the same kind can be stated.american heritage,supra.the plain meaning of these words used together is that there is more than one quantity of the same kind of individual,element,part or component.when this meaning is read together with the singular words good and service used by the legislature in section,multiple units necessarily refers to more than one good or service of the same kind.thus,we find no ambiguity arises from the language used by the legislature in section.because we conclude the statutory language is unambiguous,we need not look at the legislative history behind section as we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citations.people snook cal th,d.
plainly stated,section merely requires that the stated advertised price for the sale of a good or service of the same kind which is being offered only in multiple units be that of the minimum unit of any good or service offered.the trial court therefore properly read section to apply only to the sale of multiple units of the same kind of good or service.
in this case,bivens alleged in the first cause of action that gallery violated section by advertising mattresses for sale for with the qualification twin ea.pc.sold in sets only.such allegation reveals that the mattresses were only sold in sets,which bivens concedes is not the same as a unit.because we have determined that the plain language of section refers only to the sale of multiple units of the same good or service,it does not apply to gallery advertisements for a mattress set which is commonly known to be made up of two different goods sold together,a mattress and box springs and not multiple mattresses or multiple box springs.gallery advertisements therefore do not violate section and the complaint can not be amended to change this conclusion.the trial court thus properly sustained gallery demurrer to the first cause of action without leave to amend as a matter of law.
b.the second cause of action under section 
bivens argues the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the second cause of action because the inquiry as to whether the advertisements were misleading can not be made without evidence as to whether a significant portion of the general consuming public are likely to be deceived by the mattress advertisements placed in various newspapers by gallery.he specifically claims the advertisements mislead the least literate california consumers by making a false promise of savings and require them to engage in arithmetic in order to determine the actual amount of money they will have to spend.we conclude the trial court properly determined as a matter of law that the advertisements on their face would not be misleading to reasonable consumers.
section prohibits anyone from making statements that are untrue or misleading,and that are known,or by the exercise of reasonable care should be known,to be untrue or misleading,in order to induce consumers into purchasing property or services see consumer advocates echostar satellite th,d echostar.by its breadth,section encompass es not only those advertisements which have deceived or misled because they are untrue,but also those which may be accurate on some level,but will nonetheless tend to mislead or deceive a perfectly true statement couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or deceive the consumer,such as by failure to disclose other relevant information,is actionable under section.day v.at t th,d.whether conduct or advertising is misleading under this statutory provision is determined by applying a reasonable consumer standard lavie procter gamble th,d lavie.
the parties do not dispute the facts pertaining to gallery advertising in the los angeles times or the wording of the advertisements attached to the complaint which list the terms and restrictions for the advertised price.as noted above,if the facts appearing in the attached advertisements contradict those alleged in the complaint,those facts in the advertisements take precedence.mead sanwa bank ca
