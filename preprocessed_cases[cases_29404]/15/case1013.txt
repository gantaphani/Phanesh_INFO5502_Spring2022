real party in interest bactes imaging solutions,bactes,entered into an agreement with a hospital under which bactes agreed to respond to patient requests for copies of their medical records.under the terms of the agreement,upon receipt of a records request from a patient the hospital agreed to provide the patient records to bactes and bactes agreed to make copies of the records and provide the copies to the patient or his or her attorney.
by its express terms,evidence code section limits the amount health care providers may charge for copying patient records and providing them to attorneys retained by patients.under the terms of its agreement with the hospital,bactes had the obligation of responding to section requests and is therefore subject to the limitations of the statute.accordingly,the trial court erred in sustaining without leave to amend bactes demurrer to two causes of action which alleged bactes violated the statute.
factual and procedural background 
in january bactes entered into a contract with el centro regional medical center the hospital to provide copy services for the hospital.the agreement provided the hospital would receive,open and review all requests for patient records and determine whether the requests were appropriate.the hospital agreed that following its review of record requests,it would place the requests in a designated area for bactes representative.with respect to collecting fees from individuals and entities requesting copies,the agreement provides.el centro regional medical center will not be held responsible for the collecting of copy fees from requesting parties.bactes is solely responsible to collect all fees.indeed,with respect to fees,the agreement goes even further and directs.all fees mailed to el centro regional medical center with requests for copies for patient charts will be given to bactes representative.
bactes agreed that its representative would copy the requested records and then invoice,package and mail the copies to the patients,attorneys,insurance companies or physicians who requested the records.bactes agreed to provide these services at no charge to the hospital.bactes further agreed it would hold the hospital harmless from any loss from the operations of bactes in copying medical record information as judged in a court of law.
the first amended complaint alleges petitioner patience thornburg,through her attorneys,submitted two requests to the hospital for copies of her treatment records.bactes charged her for photocopied pages in response to the first request.with respect to the second request,the hospital charged thornburg for photocopied pages.
thornburg then filed a claim against the hospital in which she asserted the amount the hospital charged her exceeded the limit set forth in section.thornburg also filed a civil complaint against bactes,alleging violations of section and business and professions code sections et.the complaint stated thornburg would amend the complaint to name the hospital as doe in the event her claim was rejected.
bactes demurred to both causes of action and the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend,concluding the cost limitations in section do not apply to a photocopy service and thornburg failed to plead sufficient facts to establish an agency relationship between bactes and the hospital.thornburg then filed an amended complaint,naming both bactes and the hospital as defendants.the amended complaint alleged three causes of action against bactes violation of section,violation of civil code section and a third derivative cause of action in which thornburg alleged bactes violation of section supported a claim under business and professions code section et.thornburg incorporated the agreement for services between bactes and the hospital into the amended complaint.
bactes again demurred to all three causes of action.the trial court sustained bactes demurrer to the first two causes of action without leave to amend,but overruled it as to the third cause of action.the trial court reasoned that section does not apply to agents of medical providers or employers,and in any event the first amended complaint failed to allege the hospital exercised the necessary level of control over bactes to create an agency relationship.shortly afterward,thornburg requested the trial court dismiss the third cause of action without prejudice.the trial court granted the request and entered judgment in favor of bactes.
thornburg filed a notice of appeal.
discussion 
bactes argues that because the trial court dismissed thornburg third cause of action without prejudice,no appealable judgment has been entered.see hoveida scripps health th,d.thornburg agrees that in light of the holding in hoveida scripps health her appeal was premature.she asks that instead of dismissing her appeal,we treat it as a petition for a writ of mandate.because the question presented has been fully briefed on the merits,and is solely a question of law which we resolve in thornburg favor,we grant her request.see black diamond asphalt,superior court th,d campbell alger th,d ifs industries,stephens d.as thornburg points out,there would be little utility in dismissing her appeal and requiring her to litigate her wholly derivative claim under section business and professions code section in the absence of a definitive determination of her principal substantive claims under section.
in reviewing a judgment sustaining a demurrer,we examine the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory,such facts being assumed true for this purpose.mccall pacificare of,cal th,d.
the principal question we confront is whether bactes is governed by the fee limitations imposed by section.in interpreting any statute,we are guided by familiar and well established rules.these rules of statutory construction require us to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.citation.we first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.citations.these canons generally preclude judicial construction that renders part of the statute meaningless or inoperative.citation.in addition,words should be given the same meaning throughout a code unless the legislature has indicated otherwise.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.thus t he plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute.citation.statutes should be construed so as to be given a reasonable result consistent with the legislative purpose.citations.the court should take into account matters such as context,the object in view,the evils to be remedied,the history of the times and of legislation upon the same subject,public policy,and contemporaneous construction.citation rincon del diablo municipal water dist.san diego county water authority th,d.
consistent with the rules of construction,we look first to the language of the statute the first paragraph of the statute sets forth the underlying duty of health care providers to give patients access to their medical records.as the court in national football league management council superior court d,stated evidence code section states a clear public policy of permitting a patient,before filing any action,to inspect and to copy any medical records concerning the patient.the legislative purpose behind the enactment is not stated,but its apparent goal is to permit a patient to evaluate the treatment he or she received before determining whether to bring an action against the medical provider.section also enables the patient to seek freely advice concerning the adequacy of medical care and to create a medical history file for the patient information or subsequent use.it operates t
