plaintiff returned in april complaining of bearing noises and a weak battery.the dealership replaced the power steering pump and performed other repairs to the steering and air conditioning systems,and plaintiff husband later replaced the battery.she returned in early june because a door lock was malfunctioning and the car alarm would go off for no good reason.the dealership performed repairs.she returned in late june,at miles,complaining of the same rattling noise that she had experienced earlier.the dealership identified loose parts and secured them.

plaintiff returned in august,at miles,complaining that she continued to hear the same bearing noises when she turned on the engine and when she accelerated.when she picked up the car,the problem was not resolved.she decided to park the car and not use it after that date because she was concerned about safety,although she and her brother continued to drive the car occasionally.her husband disconnected the car battery.
plaintiff,through her counsel,sent a letter to defendant in january revoking her acceptance of the vehicle and demanding the return of all funds paid toward the purchase,plus attorney fees.she submitted a claim to arbitration pursuant to a provision in the warranty booklet.the arbitrator decided in april that defendant had complied with the warranty in a complete and timely manner.

trial and judgment 
a jury trial commenced in july.plaintiff and her husband,a mechanic who drove the car less frequently than plaintiff,both testified that they heard unusual noises,but there was no evidence of any problem with the vehicle driving performance.there also was no evidence of any collision,misuse,or unauthorized repairs.
plaintiff automotive service expert,jackie winters,testified that he inspected and test drove the vehicle in july and detected a rattling noise and another metallic sound coming from the engine.he made a video and audio recording of the engine running,which was played for the jury.winters testified that the repairs performed to address the noises reported by plaintiff were not effective repairs to correct those problems.he testified that the noises came from inside the engine and that the mechanics should have removed the valve cover,and perhaps other engine parts,to check inside the engine,but according to the service records they failed to do that although he did not remove any engine parts so as to identify the source of the problem,winters stated his opinion that the engine noises indicated that the engine was defective and should be replaced.he testified that a new engine would cost and that the labor to replace the engine would cost.
nathan hood,who was employed by defendant as a regional technical engineer,testified that the engine was closely monitored by sensors,including noise sensors,that would record any faults.he testified that the absence of any recorded engine faults at any time was a strong indication that there was no mechanical problem with the engine.he testified that he inspected the vehicle shortly before the trial date,test drove it,ran a diagnostic test,and reviewed the repair records.he stated his opinion that there was no defect in materials or workmanship and that he was a hundred percent positive,no doubt in my mind there is absolutely nothing wrong with the engine.he testified that the engine sounded normal and that there were no abnormal noises of any kind.
anthony hawkins,the shop foreman at the bmw dealership,testified that he personally inspected the vehicle in january and determined at that time that the bearing noise that plaintiff reported hearing on cold starts was caused by an alternator belt tensioner and idler pulley.replacement parts were ordered and installed on a subsequent visit,and hawkins determined that the problem was resolved.he testified that he inspected the vehicle again in march and determined that a different bearing noise that plaintiff reported hearing when driving at a high rpm,particularly after cold starts,was caused by a faulty power steering pump.a replacement part was ordered and installed on a subsequent visit,and he determined that the noise went away.he also testified on the work performed and repair records from later visits,and stated that he could not detect the electrical smell that plaintiff had complained about or the rattling or steering noises.
the trial court granted defendant motion for nonsuit against the implied warranty counts.
plaintiff proposed special instruction on breach of written warranty under magnuson moss,stating 
plaintiff claims that she was harmed by bmw of north america,llc violation of its written warranty under the magnuson moss warranty act.to establish this claim,plaintiff must prove all of the following 
that bmw of north america,llc provided plaintiff with a written warranty for the vehicle 
that plaintiff delivered the vehicle to bmw of north america,llc or its authorized repair facilities to repair a defect in the vehicle and 
that bmw of north america,llc or its authorized repair facilities failed or refused to repair the vehicle after a reasonable number of attempts,or after being afforded a reasonable opportunity to do so.
plaintiff also proposed special instruction,based on commercial code section,stating that the measure of damages for such a breach of written warranty was the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted,unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.
the trial court refused both special instructions,stating that the caci instructions on breach of express warranty under song beverly adequately cover what we need to cover and that magnuson moss seems to be supplanted by california law.the court gave caci,and relating to breach of express warranty under song beverly.under the instructions given,plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price paid less the value of use.the instructions required plaintiff to prove the existence of a defect covered by the warranty that a reasonable person in plaintiff situation would believe substantially impaired the vehicle use,value or safety.the jury answered no to the question whether the vehicle had such a defect the trial court entered a judgment on the jury verdict in august awarding plaintiff no relief.
new trial motion and appeal 
plaintiff moved for a new trial challenging the trial court refusal to separately instruct the jury on her count for breach of written warranty under magnuson moss.the court denied the motion,stating that plaintiff had failed to propose appropriate instructions under magnuson moss if in fact such act is applicable herein.plaintiff timely appealed the judgment.
contentions 
plaintiff contends the trial court erred by failing to separately instruct the jury on her count for breach of written warranty under magnuson moss.
