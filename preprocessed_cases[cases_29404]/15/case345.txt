trans union corporation trans union appeals,after a jury trial,a final judgment awarding terry cousin cousin in compensatory damages and in punitive damages for violating the fair credit reporting act fcra,and for defaming cousin with malice.because no reasonable jury could have found that trans union acted willfully or with malice and because there was insufficient evidence of actual damages,we vacate the district court judgment and render in favor of trans union.
background 
cousin lives in clarksdale,mississippi,with his wife and two teenage daughters,and has worked at the mississippi department of health for years.he has apparently maintained a flawless credit history except for certain items resulting from the fraudulent acts of others posing as cousin.
in,cousin brother richie misappropriated cousin personal identifying information,his name and social security number,to obtain automobile loans from two different lenders,nbc bank of mississippi nbc and city finance of okolona city finance.when richie failed to pay,the delinquencies were negatively noted on cousin file with trans union,a consumer reporting agency as defined by the fcra.
in,richie again pretended to be cousin and applied for credit to purchase an automobile in aberdeen,mississippi,a place where cousin has never lived.to purchase the automobile,richie gave a down payment check that later bounced.the dealer contacted cousin,who explained that his brother was an impostor.nevertheless,general motors acceptance corporation gmac,the apparent lender on that automobile loan,forwarded negative information about cousin to trans union.
on december,trans union sent a consumer report to cousin containing the adverse information about the gmac account or tradeline.the consumer report also contained negative information about the nbc account and another account with american general and listed a fraudulent aberdeen address.cousin immediately informed gmac of the error,and on december,cousin filled out trans union investigation request form irf and requested trans union to delete all the fraudulent information.on january,trans union responded by sending cousin a partially corrected consumer report.the gmac account and the aberdeen address were deleted,but the consumer report still contained the nbc and american general accounts.attached to the consumer report was a green postcard that said 
in response to your recent request,we have reinvestigated disputed information contained on your credit file.the enclosed file reflects the results of our investigation.some information which was disputed may have been changed or deleted due to the creditor failure to adequately respond to our verification requests.if the creditor satisfactorily verifies this information in the future,it may be reinstated to the credit file.in the event trans union reinstates information to your report as a result of credit grantor verification,you will be notified in writing and you will receive an updated copy of your trans union report reflecting the reinstatement.
in may,however,cousin sued trans union for its continued reporting of the nbc and american general accounts that lawsuit was settled in january,and trans union agreed to suppress all the adverse information about nbc and american general.
to suppress the improperly adverse information,trans union implemented a procedure called cloaking.normally,when information reported to trans union is found to be inaccurate after reinvestigation pursuant to,it is deleted.but unless the credit grantor involved also deletes the information from its monthly computer tape submission the information will be into the consumer trans union file.to avert such errors,trans union designed a procedure called cloaking.the cloak is a flag in trans union computer system associated with the subject account.the cloaking flag prevents the deleted information from reappearing in a consumer file even if the credit grantor fails to remove the inaccurate information from its magnetic tapes and resubmits the information.the cloaking flag remains in effect until the credit grantor has deleted the inaccurate information from its tape submissions for twelve consecutive months.at that point,trans union believes that the credit grantor has deleted the information permanently,and the cloaking flag expires automatically.
on february,three weeks after settling the first lawsuit,trans union sent a consumer report to cousin,which still contained the fraudulent nbc and american general accounts and the aberdeen address.furthermore,that consumer report for the first time listed a fraudulent bellsouth mobility bellsouth account.richie had apparently opened an account in cousin name with bellsouth for cellular phone service in.
on february,cousin completed another irf,again contesting the nbc and american general accounts and the aberdeen address.in addition,he challenged for the first time the bellsouth account.on february,trans union forwarded another consumer report to cousin,but it still retained all of the false information.after further communication between cousin lawyers and trans union,a clean consumer report was furnished to cousin on march.moreover,the bellsouth account was cloaked as of that date 
on november,cousin went to heafner motors heafner to buy a vehicle.after reaching agreement on price and other details,cousin sought credit to purchase the vehicle.the salesman filled out the paperwork and submitted it to the credit manager bill harmon.
at trial,harmon testified that heafner does not lend any credit instead,he stated that heafner obtains consumer reports on customers to select the best financing match among a group of lenders.heafner obtained a consumer report on cousin from trans union,which again included the old bellsouth account.the consumer report listed the account as a p and l write off and showed it to have a rating,the worst rating a consumer can receive and which means bad debt or charged off account.heafner selected gmac to provide financing for cousin purchase and sent his application,but not trans union consumer report,to it.
like heafner,gmac sought a consumer report and obtained one from equifax.the equifax report also contained the bellsouth account.gmac denied in writing cousin application for credit to purchase the car from heafner.gmac based its denial on two items the equifax report containing the bellsouth account and gmac own internal record of the loss on the prior gmac account,which neither the equifax or trans union reports listed.
cousin called heafner later in the afternoon of november,and was told that his application had not been approved.on december,cousin requested disclosure of his file from equifax.before releasing the file to cousin,equifax deleted the bellsouth account from the file,thus making cousin unaware of the bellsouth problem.
on january,cousin requested a consumer report from trans union.upon receipt,he noticed that the report included the false aberdeen address and the bellsouth account as a result,cousin sent to trans union another irf on january,notifying it that the entries were false.
in response to cousin notice,trans union sent to cousin another consumer report,dated february.that report deleted any reference to the bellsouth account,but it restated the gmac account that had previously been deleted in january.apparently,gmac had decided to the old gmac account after it noted that the equifax report did not list the gmac account.moreover,gmac had the old gmac account,using a different prefix number to designate the account.on march,cousin notified trans union about the gmac account 
on march,cousin sued trans union,alleging various claims,including negligent violation of the fcra,willful violation of the fcra,defamation with malice,and breach of contract notwithstanding this lawsuit challenging its handling of the gmac account,trans union sent to bellsouth a consumer report displaying the gmac account on april.thereafter,trans union attempted to recloak the gmac account on april.it proved to be.the following day,trans union pulled cousin file off the automated system and manually examined the file,penning certain comments on the file.moreover,it uncloaked the file.later on may,trans union sent a consumer report to gmac with the gmac tradeline still on the report.
the jury trial commenced on may.before submitting the case to the jury,trans union moved for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure.the district court granted the motion with respect to the breach of contract claim,but denied the rest of the motion.the jury returned a verdict of in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.
on june,trans union again moved for judgment as a matter of law under rule and moved for a new trial under rule.in the alternative,trans union also moved for a remittitur of the compensatory and punitive damages awards or for a new trial based upon the admission of irrelevant and prejudicial evidence and argument regarding the heafner automobile transaction.the district court denied the motions and entered judgment.this appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,trans union contends that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to cousin claims for negligent violation of the fcra,willful violation of the fcra,and defamation with malice.in the alternative,trans union maintains that it merits a remittitur of the compensatory and punitive damages awards or a new trial.we review those issues in turn.
standard of review 
judgment as a matter of law is proper on an issue if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.satcher honda motor,cir quoting.a.when reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,we will uphold a jury verdict unless the facts and inferences point so strongly and so overwhelmingly in favor of one party that reasonable men could not arrive at any verdict to the contrary.see id.furthermore,we are bound to view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the jury determination.see denton morgan,quoting rideau parkem indus,cir.although we might have reached a different conclusion if we had been the trier of fact,we are not free to reweigh the evidence or to reevaluate the credibility of witnesses.see id.we must not substitute for the jury reasonable factual inferences other inferences that we may regard as more reasonable.id.
negligent noncompliance with the fcra 
section provides statutory authority for civil liability for negligent noncompliance with the fcra.any person who is negligent in failing to comply with a requirement of the fcra is liable for any actual damages sustained by the consumer.a.here,cousin charged that trans union failed to meet the requirements of b under that section,w henever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report,it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.b.
in the present case,trans union concedes the inaccuracy of its disclosures but maintains that some of those disclosures were not consumer reports and,therefore,could not have formed the basis of a b claim.moreover,it asserts that it followed reasonable procedures as a matter of law.finally,trans union argues that the inaccurate information must have been published to a third party and that cousin must have suffered a credit denial to establish a b claim we review each argument in turn.
first,trans union maintains that there was only one consumer report in evidence,the november,report to heafner.with respect to the other disclosures of january and february to cousin himself,trans union submits that they were not consumer reports and,hence,could not have formed the basis for a claim under b,which concerns the preparation of consumer reports trans union contends that,by definition,a consumer report is a communication of information to a third party bearing on a consumer eligibility for credit.because the january and february disclosures were only to cousin,trans union asserts that they can not be consumer reports.
trans union further argues that the qualified immunity afforded disclosures to consumers pursuant to e necessarily distinguishes the january and february disclosures from consumer reports like the one sent to heafner.section pertains to the disclosure of information in a consumer file to consumers who make a request to a consumer reporting agency.under e,disclosures made pursuant to may not be the predicate for a consumer common law claims of defamation or negligence against a consumer reporting agency unless the disclosures contained information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure the consumer.moreover,e excludes from qualified immunity those actions commenced under and.trans union suggests that the january and february disclosures to cousin were not consumer reports because it is illogical to make disclosures to consumers qualifiedly immune from common law torts such as negligence but still allow them to be characterized as consumer reports and,consequently,vulnerable to attack under as the purported of negligent noncompliance with b.
although trans union argument that the january and february disclosures were not consumer reports may be valid,especially in light of e,we generally do not consider on appeal matters not presented to the trial court.webb investacorp,cir.other than,a general statement by trans union in its answer denying cousin characterization of his communications with trans union and the nature of those documents,and an attempt to include a jury instruction that no credit reports were disseminated in the instant case and that all the reports admitted in evidence were file disclosures,which attempt failed and which trans union did not object to,trans union did not present any argument remotely suggesting that the january and february disclosures,or any other disclosures,were not consumer reports for purposes of a b claim.hence,we decline to address trans union position that the january and february disclosures were not consumer reports.
trans union second argument for reversing the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law concerns the reasonableness of its cloaking procedure.the adequacy of the consumer reporting agency procedures is judged according to what a reasonably prudent person would do under the circumstances.thompson san antonio retail merchants ass n,cir.in the majority of cases,reasonableness is a question for the jury.cahlin general motors acceptance,cir.trans union,however,maintains that its procedure should be deemed to be reasonable as a matter of law because,unlike other reported cases that concerned a consumer reporting agency inadequate response to a known problem,it had no way to know that its cloaking system would fail.it argues that bellsouth and gmac should have notified it before their erroneous information about cousin,and thus,it should not have been penalized for something others failed to do.
we disagree.allowing inaccurate information back onto a credit report after deleting it because it is inaccurate is negligent.stevenson trw,cir.creditors report all magnetic tape data without notice of any kind.they do not highlight any particular data in their magnetic tape submissions.instead,it is incumbent on the consumer reporting agency to permanently delete and cloak the erroneous information.trans union knew about problems with as trans union own cloaking manual indicated that a process had to be developed to ensure that inaccurate information that was deleted did not keep reappearing.trans union offers no reason why,as a matter of law,cloaking for only twelve months is a reasonable procedure,especially when it could have easily cloaked any adverse information permanently and when its own witness conceded that in retrospect the twelve month cloaking procedure may have been unreasonable the fact that experian,another of trans union consumer reporting agency competitors,did not have a problem with ensuring the of,at least,the bellsouth account suggests the unreasonableness of trans union procedure.accordingly,trans union cloaking procedure was not reasonable as a matter of law,and the issue of reasonableness was properly before the jury to consider.
trans union final argument concerns whether the inaccurate information must have been published to a third party and that cousin must have suffered a credit denial to establish a b claim.in essence,that argument involves two interrelated legal and charges that no injury flowed from the disclosures of the inaccurate information because they were not publicized to a third party and that cousin suffered no injury because there was no credit denial.referring to various cases from this and other circuits,trans union insists that publication and denial of credit are prerequisites to a b claim.see,pinner schmidt,cir philbin trans union,cir casella equifax credit info.servs,cir cahlin,hauser equifax,cir.but see guimond trans union credit info,cir concluding that district court erred in predicating liability under b on the occurrence of a credit denial or the transmission of a report to a third party.because the january and february disclosures were sent to cousin,rather than a third party,and because they did not contribute to a credit denial,trans union contends that those disclosures can not support cousin claim for negligent noncompliance with b.as for the consumer report sent to heafner in november,trans union maintains that there was no evidence indicating that heafner utilized the report to deny credit to cousin.
we need not address trans union specific arguments as to whether publication and denial of credit are necessary to assert a b claim because even assuming arguendo that denial of credit and publication are not prerequisites for a b claim,we see insufficient evidence of actual damages to warrant the jury award.as previously noted,provides for actual damages when there has been negligent noncompliance with the fcra.here,the jury awarded in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.those compensatory damages constituted the actual damages award and were apparently for cousin purported denial of credit by heafner and for his emotional distress trans union contends that no compensatory damages should have been awarded for cousin failure to receive credit for the purchase of a vehicle because the credit grantor did not utilize a trans union credit report.it asserts that gmac,not heafner,denied cousin credit and that gmac used a report from equifax and its own internal files.additionally,trans union argues that the evidence did not support an award for cousin emotional distress.
having reviewed the record,we agree.there was no legally sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that a trans union credit report was utilized to deny cousin credit.three items purportedly supported the belief that heafner denied cousin credit based on a trans union credit report.one,a letter from gmac read 
we were recently informed by heafner motors,that it was considering the credit sale or lease of an automobile or other product to you and asked whether we would be prepared to accept your obligation if the transaction was completed.we must regretfully inform you that we were not agreeable to handling the proposed transaction.
two,some testimony revealed that heafner would have been noted as the on the vehicle installment sales contract.three,additional testimony indicated that heafner assigns loans to other entities after the sale of a car.although we are bound to view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the jury determination,we can not find that a reasonable jury would have inferred from the foregoing evidence that heafner denied cousin credit based on a trans union credit report,particularly when the unequivocal testimony from heafner was that it does not grant credit to customers the thrust of the evidence indicated that gmac was the credit grantor and that it denied cousin application based on an internal credit report and a report from equifax,not trans union.as the denial of credit was due to something other than trans union consumer report on cousin,we can not justify the compensatory damages award to include damages arising from that credit denial.
accordingly,the only possible actual damages related to cousin emotional distress.the evidence of that distress,however,was very limited and legally insufficient.cousin testified that as a result of the november,credit denial,he felt real frustrated and irritated because the bellsouth information was being at the time he felt emotional distress,he did not know whether a trans union report had been utilized by any of the parties.in light of the fact that the credit denial occurred due to an equifax report,cousin emotional distress from the denial of credit can not be attributed to trans union,and he can not recover actual damages for that distress.
the only other testimony about emotional distress concerned cousin reaction to seeing his inaccurate trans union credit reports of november,and january,upon being questioned about how he felt when he saw the november,credit report,cousin testified 
a very upset,angry.and it just was that,you know,all things i had done,the company to did hear me.i had told them over and over again but they did listen to me,you know.so that how i felt.
q you felt like nobody was listening 
a felt like nobody was listening.
as for the january,disclosure,cousin stated 
a i felt like,if you k now anything about a maze,it like being trapped inside of something that you ca get out of.
in carey piphus,d,the supreme court required proof of actual injury for compensatory damages to be awarded for mental or emotional distress in an action brought under.it concluded that a jury award for emotional distress must be supported by evidence of genuine injury,such as the evidence of the injured party conduct and the observations of others.id.at.we extended carey holding and reasoning to other cases involving federal claims for emotional harm in patterson healthcare,cir,a case concerning claims for racial discrimination and retaliatory discharge.there,we recognized that to establish intangible loss,carey requires a degree of specificity which may include corroborating testimony or medical or psychological evidence in support of the damage award.id.at.in patterson,we were confronted with the following evidence of emotional distress by one of the plaintiffs.
he testified that he felt frustrated and real bad for being judged by the color of his skin.he explained that the work environment was unbearable and was tearing his down.he also stated that it hurt and made him angry and paranoid to know that his supervisor referred to him as a porch monkey or a nigger and generally though that he was inferior to white employees.
id.at.that plaintiff testimony was much more concrete than cousin yet,we vacated the district court emotional distress award,finding that his testimony of mental distress was insufficient.id.because cousin presented no more than what was offered in patterson,we likewise vacate the award for emotional distress in the present case for insufficient evidence of actual damages 
willful noncompliance with the fcra 
section provides the statutory authority for civil liability for willful noncompliance with the fcra.as with his negligent noncompliance claim,cousin willful noncompliance claim pertains to trans union failure to meet the requirements of b.under the willful noncompliance statute,a consumer may obtain punitive damages.see a.here,the jury awarded in punitive damages.
malice or evil motive need not be established for a punitive damages award,but the violation must have been willful.fischl general motors acceptance,cir.in pinner,we noted that willful is a word of many meanings and that its construction is often influenced by its context.see pinner,at.in concluding that the consumer reporting agency in that case did not commit a willful violation,we remarked that there was no evidence suggesting that the agency knowingly and intentionally committed an act in conscious disregard for the rights of others.see also philbin,at stevenson,at.generally,courts have allowed a willful noncompliance claim to proceed where a defendant conduct involves willful misrepresentations or concealments.see pinner,at.in those cases,a consumer reporting agency has typically misrepresented or concealed some or all of a credit report from a consumer.see id.discussing millstone reports,cir see also stevenson,at.
in its initial brief,trans union asserts two bases for rejecting cousin claim.first,it argues that cousin claim depended heavily on allegations that trans union willfully reinserted the gmac tradeline into cousin consumer report in early and that judicial estoppel should have barred that claim from being asserted.second,trans union maintains that cousin failed to present sufficient evidence of willfulness,comparing the instant situation to various other decisions involving far more egregious facts that were held insufficient to state a claim under.
we need not address the first of trans union arguments as cousin essentially concedes in his response brief that trans union did not willfully dredge up the gmac tradeline and reinsert it into cousin consumer report.notwithstanding this apparent concession,cousin challenges trans union second argument that he failed to present sufficient evidence of willfulness.cousin points to several facts,which apparently were brought forth at trial,to establish that trans union actions constituted willful noncompliance.first,cousin refers to the of the bellsouth account in the november,report to heafner despite the prior cloaking and the december notice from bellsouth to trans union confirming that the bellsouth information was subscription fraud.second,cousin argues that trans union knew about the problems of but failed to do anything about it.he maintains that the company failed to adequately assess whether a cloaking system would work.third,cousin complains of trans union transmittal to bellsouth on april,a report including the fraudulent gmac tradeline.finally,cousin raises the uncloaking of his consumer report on april,after the report had been cloaked on april,and its transmission to gmac in its reply to cousin brief,trans union attempts to address cousin 
at trial,cousin introduced evidence that the bellsouth tradeline was fraudulent and that trans union had cloaked the account in march.additional evidence indicated that in december,bellsouth had submitted to trans union a udf stating that the bellsouth account was probably subscription fraud.eleven months later,the bellsouth tradeline reappeared in cousin file.testimony indicated that bellsouth may have the adverse tradeline information to trans union between april and august.the prior lawsuit,the cloaking of the bellsouth account,and bellsouth own udf transmittal may have put trans union on notice about the falsity of the bellsouth account with respect to cousin nevertheless,we can not conclude that such evidence is legally sufficient to establish that trans union willfully violated b.in philbin,the third circuit found no willful violation despite the reappearance of inaccurate information that had previously been deleted and which the consumer had again notified the consumer reporting agency about when that information reappeared.see see also casella,at failing to delete inaccurate information notwithstanding notification to consumer reporting agency did not rise to the level of conscious disregard or deliberate and purposeful action necessary to make out a willful noncompliance claim.the present situation is no more egregious than in philbin or casella.the fact that trans union may have had experience with cousin bellsouth tradeline and that bellsouth had submitted a udf to trans union about subscription fraud does not necessarily translate into knowingly and intentionally committing an act in conscious disregard of cousin rights.bellsouth itself appears to have reinserted the information,and several months had elapsed from the time of the udf the initial cloaking to the reinsertion of the bellsouth tradeline into cousin file.finally,trans union did not conceal cousin consumer reports or misrepresent them.that in and of itself suggests that trans union did not commit a willful violation of b.stevenson,at only defendants who engaged in willful misrepresentations or concealments have committed a willful violation and are subject to punitive damages under.
similarly,we find cousin argument with respect to trans union failure to implement a better cloaking system unavailing.the system was not perfect,but it was effective for a few months,and trans union never attempted to mislead cousin with respect to his consumer report or his rights.we may fault the failure to implement a cloaking procedure as unreasonable,but we can not say that it was willful.
as for trans union disclosure of cousin consumer reports to bellsouth in april and to gmac in may,we first note the evidence at trial and the parties admissions.when on january,after having been denied credit to purchase a car from heafner,cousin received a trans union report,the report included the false aberdeen address and the bellsouth tradeline.cousin immediately notified trans union that those entries were false,and trans union deleted them.at that time,however,gmac submitted to trans union,as much of the evidence indicates and as cousin now apparently concedes,the old gmac tradeline that had previously been deleted from cousin report.but gmac utilized a different prefix code to identify the tradeline rather than the old one.cousin notified trans union about the fraudulent nature of the gmac tradeline on march.that tradeline was later released in a consumer report to bellsouth on april.on april,the record reveals that cousin file was cloaked.that cloak was as it was uncloaked the next day.thereafter,on may,cousin consumer report with the fraudulent gmac tradeline was transmitted to gmac.
although the consumer reports to bellsouth and to gmac contained inaccurate information about the gmac tradeline,we do not believe that those or any other acts amount to legally sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find for cousin on his claim for violation of b.the gmac tradeline had a new prefix code and,in essence,was not the same as before.we can not deem as a willful violation trans union inability to distinguish two tradelines that on their face were different.thus,trans union failure to quickly delete the gmac tradeline and its decision to release a consumer report with that information while it reinvestigated the tradeline can not be deemed a willful violation of b.see providing reinvestigation procedure in case of disputed accuracy.
cousin makes much of the fact that trans union cloaked his file on april with notations stating id fraud and derogs and then uncloaked the file the next day.he argues that the uncloaking demonstrates willfulness because the evidence showed that only a trans union supervisor could have manually uncloaked his file.thus,cousin believes that trans union must have intended for the gmac tradeline to be in his file.even if a trans union supervisor had uncloaked cousin file,we conclude that such an act did not constitute a willful violation of b.as the testimony indicated,cloaking is a process whereby trans union precludes future submissions of inaccurate tradeline information from being entered into a consumer file.cloaking does not concern the actual deletion of any inaccurate information.hence,when trans union determined to uncloak cousin file,it did not actually do anything substantively to his file.rather,trans union allowed the status quo to stand while it reinvestigated the fraudulent nature of the gmac tradeline.consequently,we see no willful violation of b under the evidence presented to the jury 
defamation with malice 
cousin last claim is a common law action for defamation with malice.under e,consumer reporting agencies are generally qualifiedly immune from state law claims for defamation unless they involve malice or willful intent to injure.both trans union and cousin agree that courts have determined that malice under this statutory scheme is congruent with the common law standard.see thornton equifax,cir.thus,to establish defamation with malice in the present case,one must establish that the defendant when he published the words either knew they were false,or published them in reckless disrega
