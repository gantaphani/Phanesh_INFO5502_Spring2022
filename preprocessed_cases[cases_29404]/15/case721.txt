background 
milicevic purchased a new mercedes from fletcher jones imports on may,for.from day one,the car exhibited a number of aesthetic and mechanical problems.within the first seven months,the following repairs were made all four brake rotors were warped and required replacement at miles after locking milicevic out of the car,the remote entry system was replaced the motor for the passenger side window was replaced the passenger side mirror was replaced due to a thumb print in the paint and the rear window seal and molding were unsuccessfully repaired three times.all repairs were made under mercedes limited written warranty.by the end of seven months,the car had spent days at fletcher jones repair shop.
at that point,milicevic wanted mercedes to replace the car or to reimburse her for the purchase price and take the car back.her attorney and christopher gellner,wrote a letter to to that effect,explaining the series of problems and repairs.aside from a cursory letter notifying gellner that he would be contacted by a local representative of in the near future,did not respond to gellner letter,even though he made a series of unreturned phone calls.milicevic sued and fletcher jones imports.
before trial,mercedes served a trial witness subpoena upon gellner calling for him to testify at trial gellner then associated attorney dale haley for the case.at the outset of trial,mercedes made a motion to exclude gellner as counsel and to exclude him from the courtroom while other witnesses were testifying.the district court denied the motion,allowing gellner to proceed as counsel so long as haley gellner and haley conducted opening and closing arguments.
the contested issues addressed at trial were whether the brakes on milicevic car were defective it was necessary for milicevic to leave the car at fletcher jones for an extended period while parts were on order for the rear window repair and the unsuccessful repair of the rear window was significant.ultimately,milicevic testified at trial that she found the car use and value impaired i feel like i am stranded.i can not feel comfortable to take the car on a trip.i do not feel comfortable to drive because i do know what next will come e very day is a new problem.
as noted above,the district court found the facts before the court amounted to a breach of the written warranty between the parties and a violation of both the nevada lemon law and the warranty act.milicevic was awarded purchase price of the car,including taxes and fees,less an amount which represented her reasonable use of the vehicle.on milicevic motion,the district court also awarded milicevic attorneys fees,but reduced the hourly rate milicevic requested for her attorneys from per hour to per hour.the district court also reduced the number of hours her attorneys billed,concluding that some of the hours billed were unnecessary and duplicative.

the first issue is whether mercedes appeal is moot for lack of a case or controversy between the parties because mercedes paid the judgment as ordered by the district court.it is not so made moot.
the usual rule in the federal courts is that payment of a judgment does not foreclose an appeal.unless there is some contemporaneous agreement not to appeal,implicit in a compromise of the claim after judgment,and so long as,upon reversal,restitution can be enforced,payment of the judgment does not make the controversy moot.

ii.federal rule of evidence 
this case presents a novel question under federal rule of evidence.at the start of trial,mercedes informed the district court it planned to call gellner as a witness and,thus,moved the district court to remove gellner as milicevic trial counsel and exclude him from the courtroom while other witnesses were testifying.the district court denied the motion.to eliminate any possibility of gellner using his role as trial counsel to inject his credibility into portions of the trial other than his testimony,however,gellner was barred from examining witnesses on issues about which he had knowledge further,haley was ordered to conduct gellner examination and to make plaintiff opening and closing arguments.on appeal,mercedes contends that the district court committed reversible error under federal rule of evidence when it denied mercedes motion to exclude gellner from the courtroom while other witnesses were testifying,despite the fact that he was to be called by mercedes to testify at trial.we disagree.
federal rule of evidence generally provides that at the request of a party a district court shall,or on its own motion the district court may,order witnesses excluded from the courtroom so that they can not hear the testimony of other witnesses.however,this exclusionary rule is subject to four exceptions,the third of which excepts from exclusion a person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party cause.thus,where a particular trial counsel is essential to the presentation of the client cause,we agree with the eighth circuit that.clearly would allow trial counsel to remain present in the courtroom as an exception to the exclusionary rule for witnesses.united states reeder,cir.
here,gellner had represented milicevic from the beginning of the claim process,and milicevic had special reasons for insisting he continue as one of her attorneys.further,haley was associated as counsel for trial preparation and trial,and gellner participation at trial was limited,as set out above.under these circumstances,we can not say the district court abused its discretion when it denied mercedes motion to exclude gellner from the courtroom 
finally,gellner testimony was duplicative of milicevic testimony or related to issues which have not been challenged on appeal.thus,even if the court had erred under federal rule of evidence,which we do not believe it did given gellner status as essential to the presentation of the case and given the engagement of special,the error was harmless.see united states ell,cir holding that although prejudice is presumed when a court fails to comply with rule,harmless error analysis is nonetheless appropriate.
iii.nevada lemon law 
the district court did not commit clear error when it found a violation of the nevada lemon law.there was sufficient evidence to support the district court finding that after a reasonabl
