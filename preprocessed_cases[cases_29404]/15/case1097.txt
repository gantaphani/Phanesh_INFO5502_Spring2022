in this case,we hold a service contract,supplementing the factory warranty accompanying a new car,is not an express warranty entitling the consumer to the replacement or restitution remedy contained in section,subdivision d of the consumer warranty act,et,hereafter.
daimlerchrysler corporation hereafter chrysler appeals a judgment requiring it to repurchase rosemarie and william gavaldon dodge caravan minivan because of recurrent transmission problems occurring after the factory mile warranty expired,but while a service contract was still in effect.it contends the trial court erred in concluding the service contract was also an express warranty.in her,gavaldon contends the trial court should have allowed her to elect coverage under an optional express warranty and improperly calculated damages.we reverse the judgment against chrysler.
gavaldon bought her new dodge caravan minivan in june.the vehicle came with chrysler standard factory warranty under which the owner could choose either a mile basic warranty the warranty or a mile basic warranty plus a power train coverage.gavaldon stipulated,and the trial court found,that the warranty applied.the minivan also came with an warranty and two mile emission system warranties.
when gavaldon purchased the minivan,she also purchased a service contract,issued by chrysler,for an additional.the service contract provided it was to protect the buyer against major repair bills should a component covered by the plan fail in normal use.the stated coverage was the plan will pay the total cost parts and labor less a deductible per visit,to correct any of the following part failures,due to a defect in materials or workmanship,not covered by the vehicle limited warranties.covered components included power train parts such as the engine and transmission.the service contract advised the buyer the vehicle might also be covered by a manufacturer limited warranty,only vehicles covered by one of chrysler regular limited warranties are eligible for the service contract,and it did not cover r epair or replacement of any component covered by the vehicle factory warranty or recall policies.it provided coverage for repairs would not start until the vehicle limited warranties expire,and ended years after the factory warranty start date or when the vehicle has accumulated total miles of service whichever occurs first.the service contract warned the buyer,important the maximum reimbursable amount should a covered component fail will be the total cost of the repairs less the deductible or,if less,the cash value of the vehicle 
after she had driven the minivan about miles,gavaldon began to notice the transmission was slipping.although she took the vehicle to the dealer for regular service at miles,miles and miles,she made no mention of any transmission problems.
at miles,and again at miles,gavaldon took the minivan to the dealer for regular service and complained the transmission was shifting hard and getting stuck in gear.on both occasions,the dealer investigated but found no problems.
at miles,the vehicle transmission became stuck in mode and was towed to the dealership.in mode,the vehicle gets locked in second gear to protect the transmission from further damage while permitting the car to be driven at a reduced speed to a repair facility.the transmission was removed,overhauled,and the torque converter replaced.the repairs were covered by the service contract.
at miles,gavaldon took the minivan to the dealer complaining it was stalling at stops and surging as if running out of gas.the throttle position sensor,spark plug wires,and transmission controller were replaced.these repairs were covered by the emissions systems warranty.
at miles,the vehicle was towed to the dealer because of overheating.the water pump,water pump gasket,and a heater hose were replaced and the repairs were covered by the service contract.although the dealer records made no mention of complaints about the transmission,gavaldon testified the car was stuck in mode and she complained about the transmission.
at miles,gavaldon brought the car in complaining the transmission was slipping in and out of mode.the solenoid pack,which controls the transmission hydraulic fluid,was replaced,as were a throttle positioning sensor and wiring harness.
in february,gavaldon wrote to the dealer,and then directly to chrysler,complaining of the vehicle chronic transmission problems and asking it be repurchased or replaced.her request was denied.
at miles,gavaldon brought the car to the dealer complaining about the transmission hard shifting and slipping.no problems were found.
in july,at miles,the minivan again got stuck in mode and was towed to the dealer.the transmission was completely replaced.the service contract paid the cost of the repairs.the new transmission was replaced again at miles under a parts warranty because it was leaking.
gavaldon did not present the minivan for any more repairs.in october,she filed her complaint alleging chrysler had breached its obligations under section,subdivision d by failing to promptly replace or repurchase the minivan when it was unable to conform the vehicle to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts.she also alleged chrysler breached the express warranty under,subd.a and common law gavaldon alleged the vehicle was covered by the express warranty,a defect arose while that express warranty was still in effect,and chrysler breached the express warranty by failing to remedy the defect.at trial,gavaldon was permitted to amend her complaint to allege breach of the service contract as well.
a jury trial ended in a mistrial when the judge became ill.the second trial was a court trial.before it began,the trial court ruled the service contract was not an express warranty under.
on august,the court issued a tentative ruling in favor of chrysler.it concluded the minivan transmission was defective,but the defect arose after the applicable express warranty had expired.it concluded the service contract was not an express warranty.thus,gavaldon only remedy was for repairs to be made under the service contract,which had been performed.a judgment for chrysler was entered on august.
on september,gavaldon filed a notice of intention to move for a new trial.at a hearing on september,the court noted that its august ruling was only a tentative ruling and it had now reached a different conclusion about the nature of the service contract.the court stated the august judgment had been entered by mistake the court had not intended a final judgment be entered because it had not yet finished deciding the case.accordingly,it made a nunc pro tunc order vacating the august judgment.on september,the court issued a new tentative ruling in favor of gavaldon,and in response to chrysler request,issued a formal statement of decision on october.
in its statement of decision,the court found gavaldon had received the express warranty with the minivan,which had expired before the transmission problems arose.the court concluded,however,that the service contract constituted an express warranty,entitling gavaldon to the repurchase remedy set forth in section,subdivision d.although the court believed its conclusion to be contrary to the legislature intent,it opined the holding in reveles toyota by the bay th,d compelled the result.the court held the only basis for gavaldon to recover was by treating the service contract as an express warranty.it found the transmission defect was discovered at miles when the transmission first became stuck in mode.gavaldon was entitled to costs including attorney fees but not to civil penalties.
a judgment awarding gavaldon purchase price minus a deduction for actual use of the vehicle was entered on november.chrysler appealed the november judgment gavaldon.a order awarded gavaldon in attorney fees and costs chrysler appealed that order as well and we ordered the two appeals consolidated.
gavaldon motions to dismiss appeal 
before we address the merits of chrysler appeal,we must address several preliminary issues raised by gavaldon.she has filed two separate motions to dismiss chrysler appeal and has made a third in her respondent brief.none has merit all are denied.
failure to appeal order vacating august judgment 
gavaldon contends the september,order vacating the judgment entered on august,was directly appealable.chrysler appealed the final judgment entered november,but did not appeal the order vacating the earlier judgment.in her first motion to dismiss,gavaldon argues the issue raised by chrysler on this the trial court erred in holding a service contract is an express warranty under section,subdivision d could have been raised on appeal from the order vacating the first judgment.therefore,we can not consider it on an appeal from the final judgment.we reject the contention.
an order vacating a judgment is an appealable order code civ,subd.a baldwin home sav.of america th,d,if the underlying judgment was an appealable final judgment elsea saberi th,d.the september order vacating the august judgment was not appealable because the judgment was not final.when the court vacated the august judgment nunc pro tunc,it stated that judgment had been entered by mistake and it had never intended to enter a final judgment because it was not finished deciding the case.the trial court has inherent authority to correct its clerical errors with nunc pro tunc orders.hamilton laine th,d.we take the court at its word the august judgment was entered by mistake.it was entered just a few days after its tentative ruling was issued.the court had not yet issued a statement of the time for requesting one had not even expired.code civ.we deny the motion to dismiss.
collateral estoppel 
gavaldon argues the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars chrysler appeal.again,we reject her contention.
on october,after this appeal was filed,a judgment was entered in los angeles county against chrysler in a virtually identical case involving a different plaintiff.hernandez chrysler corporation,no.in that case,after the trial court instructed the jury that a service contract is an express warranty under,the jury returned a verdict finding chrysler had violated its duty to replace or repurchase a defective vehicle under section,subdivision d.gavaldon claims chrysler filed its notice of appeal of that judgment one day too late,and we should deem it to be a final judgment.from that premise,she goes on to assert chrysler is now forever barred from contending in any court that a service contract is not an express warranty.
we need not address the merits of gavaldon motion we reject her argument for the simple reason that there is not a final judgment in the los angeles county case.in fact,there no longer is any judgment.the parties settled the action and stipulated the judgment would be vacated and the action dismissed with prejudice.on february,the los angeles county superior court vacated the judgment and dismissed the action.accordingly,we deny gavaldon second motion to dismiss.
incomplete appellant appendix 
finally,in her opening brief,gavaldon argues we must dismiss chrysler appeal because it filed an incomplete appellant appendix.cal.rules of court,rule specifically,she complains that chrysler omitted three trial exhibits from the appellant appendix.she also objects because one of the exhibits which was included,the service contract,was not the actual one admitted at trial.chrysler appendix included the form service contract,while the one admitted at trial had gavaldon name and information about her vehicle on it.gavaldon did not include any of these items in a respondent appendix.the version of the service contract was included in chrysler reply appendix the other omitted exhibits were not.
we reject gavaldon assertion these transgressions mandate dismissal of the appeal.under the version of california rules of court,rule,in effect when this appeal was filed and briefed,sanctions could be imposed for the w illful or grossly negligent filing of an appendix containing nonconforming copies,or for filing an appendix that is so inadequate that justice can not be done,former cal.rules of court,rule i,italics added but neither appears to be the case here.gavaldon does not suggest she was prejudiced by the omissions or that they affect our ability to review this matter.furthermore,a ll exhibits admitted in evidence or refused are deemed part of the appendix,whether or not it contains copies of them.cal.rules of court,rule b.gavaldon does not suggest the omitted exhibits were relevant to any issues presented.she does not contend the blank form service contract is in any way different than the one that had her name typed on it.furthermore,if there were omitted items gavaldon believed to be relevant,she could have included them in a respondent appendix but did not.cal.rules of court,rule b.in any event,the service contract is contained in the appellant reply appendix.
statement of decision doctrine of implied findings 
gavaldon argues that despite the trial court issuance of a formal statement of decision code civ,setting forth the factual and legal basis for its ruling in her favor,we must apply the doctrine of implied findings and affirm the judgment if correct on any theory supported by the evidence.we reject her contention.
if timely requested,the trial court in a nonjury trial must issue a statement of decision explaining the factual and legal basis for its decision on each of the principal controverted issues for which the statement was requested.code civ.the statement of decision provides a record of the court reasoning on particular disputed issues which we may review in determining whether its decision is supported by the evidence and the law.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals writs the rutter group,in re marriage of ditto d.if the parties have waived a statement of decision by failing to request it or requesting it too late,then we presume the court made all factual findings necessary to support the judgment for which substantial evidence exists in the record.michael jamie cal d.
gavaldon argues we must adopt the doctrine of implied findings,even though a statement of decision was requested and issued,because the formal statement of decision was not included in chrysler appellant appendix.chrysler remedied the defect by including it in the reply appendix.gavaldon cites in re marriage of ditto,supra,d at page.as holding that when a statement of decision is not included in the appellant appendix,all intendments will favor the trial court ruling and it will be presumed on appeal that the trial court found all facts necessary to support the judgment.but she misquotes and misrepresents the case.in ditto,no statement of decision was issued by the trial court because none was requested.ditto held that when no statement of decision was requested,the doctrine of implied findings applies.ibid.given that gavaldon has cited no authority supporting her proposition,that a statement of decision was requested and issued,and that it is contained in the reply appendix,we find no basis for disregarding it as she urges.
liability under 
in its statement of decision,the trial court found gavaldon had received a mile express warranty with the minivan,which had expired before the transmission problems arose.it concluded the only basis for recovery was if the service contract constituted an express warranty under section,subdivision d.the trial court held it did and concluded chrysler had breached its obligations under that section by failing to promptly replace or repurchase the minivan when it was unable to conform the vehicle to an express warranty after a reasonable number of attempts.we agree with chrysler that this ruling was legally incorrect.
background 
enacted in,outlines protective measures for buyers of consumer goods.stats,ch,et it regulates warranty terms,imposes service and repair obligations on manufacturers,distributors,and retailers who make express warranties,requires disclosure of specified information in express warranties,and broadens a buyer remedies to include costs,attorney fees,and civil penalties.citations.krieger nick alexander imports,d.is manifestly a remedial measure,intended for the protection of the consumer it should be given a construction calculated to bring its benefits into action.citation.kwan of north america,th,d.
section,subdivision a provides,any buyer of consumer goods who is damaged by a failure to comply with any obligation under this chapter or under an implied or express warranty or service contract may bring an action for the recovery of damages and other legal and equitable relief.subdivision b provides the measure of damage shall include the rights of replacement or reimbursement as set forth in subdivision d of section,and the following where the buyer has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance of the goods or has exercised any right to cancel the sale,sections,and of the commercial code shall apply.where the buyer has accepted the goods,sections and of the commercial code shall apply,and the measure of damages shall include the cost of repairs necessary to make the goods conform.
a core provision of,as it pertains to new motor vehicles,is the remedy of replacement or restitution contained in section,subdivision d.it provides,if the manufacturer or its representative in this state is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle,as that term is defined in paragraph of subdivision e of section,to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts,the manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new motor vehicle in accordance with subparagraph a or promptly make restitution to the buyer in accordance with subparagraph b.however,the buyer shall be free to elect restitution in lieu of replacement,and in no event shall the buyer be required by the manufacturer to accept a replacement vehicle.italics added.
section defines an express warranty as a written statement arising out of a sale to the consumer of a consumer good pursuant to which the manufacturer,distributor,or retailer undertakes to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the consumer good or provide compensation if there is a failure in utility or performance,subd.a.it is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that formal words such as warrant or guarantee be used,but if such words are used then an express warranty is created,subd.b.
it is undisputed that the replacement and restitution remedy of section,subdivision d applies only when there has been a failure to conform to an express warranty.the issue is whether express warranty,as that term is used in section,subdivision d,includes a service contract.we conclude it does not.
other express warranties 
preliminarily,gavaldon argues we may affirm the judgment based on express warranties other than the service contract.she argues the mile emissions systems warranty was still in effect when the transmission problems arose and we should affirm based on finding chrysler failed to conform the vehicle to that warranty.she also argues we may affirm under the warranty because the evidence supports a finding that the transmission problems arose while the warranty was still in effect,even though she did not report them until after it had expired.we can not affirm on either of these theories as they are contrary to the express findings the trial court made in its statement of decision.the trial court found gavaldon had received a warranty,the problems did not arise until after the warranty had expired and the only applicable warranty was the service contract.gavaldon filed no objections to the statement of decision and does not appeal these findings 
service contract not an express warranty 
we agree with chrysler that its service contract is not an express warranty under section,subdivision d.separately regulates service contracts,and nowhere in the act is the term used synonymously with express warranty.a service contract is defined as a contract in writing to perform,for an additional cost,over a fixed period of time or for a specified duration,services relating to the maintenance,replacement,or repair of a consumer product,except that this term does not include a policy of automobile insurance,as defined in section of the insurance code,subd.o.the act envisions that a service contract made be sold in addition to,or in lieu of,an express warranty,provided that it fully and conspicuously discloses in simple and readily understood language the terms,conditions,and exclusions of that contract,subd.a.a service contract must obligate the service contract seller to provide the buyer all of the services and functional parts that may be necessary to maintain proper operation of the entire product for the duration of the service contract and without additional charge,subd.b.but a service contract may not duplicate the coverage of the product express warranty.section,subdivision a provides,the service contract is applicable only to items,costs,and time periods not covered by the express warranty.italics added.the service contract may run concurrently with or overlap an express warranty only if it covers items or costs not covered by the express warranty or provides relief to the purchaser not available under the express warranty,such as automatic replacement of a product where the express warranty only provides for repair.
throughout,express warranties are distinguished from service contracts.we see nothing in the plain language of the statutory scheme indicating the legislature intended to extend section,subdivision d replacement or restitution remedy to service contracts.furthermore,nothing in the service contract purchased by gavaldon should have led her to believe the remedy would apply.the service contract plainly warned,important the maximum reimbursable amount should a covered component fail will be the total cost of the repairs less the deductible or,if less,the cash value of the vehicle 
the trial court initially determined a service contract was not an express warranty.but it subsequently changed its position,even though it believed it to be contrary to the legislative intent,concluding the reasoning in reveles toyota by the bay,supra,th,d compelled its result.we conclude reveles is not controlling.
in reveles,the plaintiff purchased a used vehicle from a dealership.the sale was as is,without an express warranty,so he also purchased a vehicle service agreement covering repair of mechanical failures of various parts for two years or miles.two months later,the front end of the car suddenly dropped,and the dealer mechanic told the plaintiff the vehicle had significant preexisting frame damage and could not be repaired.nonetheless,the dealer refused the plaintiff demand it replace the vehicle or refund his purchase price,insisting repairs would be made.reveles toyota by the bay,supra,th at,d.
the plaintiff sued the dealer for breach of contract,rescission and restitution,negligent and intentional misrepresentation,breach of the consumers legal remedies act et and breach of.after rejecting the plaintiff repeated offers to settle for,on the morning of trial the dealer announced it would settle for that amount.the plaintiff settled but reserved his right to move for attorney fees and costs to which he argued he was entitled under code of civil procedure section,section,the consumers legal remedies act and.the trial court eventually found the plaintiff was the prevailing party and awarded him in attorney fees,in expert witness fees,and in other costs.reveles toyota by the bay,supra,th at,d.
the appellate department of the superior court reversed the award,but the appellate court affirmed it.reveles toyota by the bay,supra,th at,d.after confirming attorney fees and costs were properly awarded under section and code of civil procedure section,the court went on to hold attorney fees were also properly awarded under the consumers legal remedies act,and under,attorney fees and expert witness fees were recoverable.reveles toyota by the bay,supra,th at,d.
the issue in reveles with respect to,was whether the plaintiff as a purchaser of a used car was in any way protected by the act so as to affirm his recovery of costs and attorney fees.applies to the purchase of consumer goods which are generally defined as being new goods,subd.a.notwithstanding that definition,section provides also applies to used consumer good
