in connection with a personal loan of roughly that lendmark financial services,a georgia corporation,made to michelle williams,a maryland resident,williams was charged and paid numerous late fees.in this action she challenges,under maryland credit grantor closed end credit provisions clec.code,com.law et,the manner in which lendmark charged and applied those late fees.after the district court entered judgment for lendmark,williams filed this appeal.
she contends that lendmark violated clec and the promissory note that she signed by applying her monthly payments first to late charges,then to interest,and finally to principal that it violated clec and the note by imposing late charges on certain timely payments when it concluded that its application of her monthly payments to satisfy earlier late fees rendered the amount of the monthly payments insufficient to pay the interest and principal due and that it violated clec and the note by prematurely assessing late charges on its accounting records by posting them after the close of business on the fifth day of the grace period provided for in the note,rather than on the following day.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court dismissal of williams first and third claims and reverse the dismissal of her second claim.
in november,williams borrowed from lendmark,executing a promissory note in favor of lendmark.the note required williams to pay monthly installments of each,representing an annual interest rate of.in the note,williams agreed that if she did not pay a monthly installment by the first day of each month plus a grace period,she would have to pay a late charge of of the late installment or,whichever was the greater.the note provided that all payments were to be applied first to late charges,then to accrued interest,and finally to principal.
williams had three methods by which to make payments by making the payments in person at lendmark branch offices,which were open generally from to by making the payments over the telephone to lendmark branch offices during business hours and by making the payments by mail.thus,there were no means by which lendmark could receive a payment on a given day after the close of business.accordingly,in administering the loan,lendmark posted late charges on its accounting records after the close of business on the fifth day of the grace period.
for the first three months january to march williams made timely monthly payments of.no explanation is given for why she paid each month rather than the specified in the note.in april,williams made her payment late and was charged a late fee of.from then until december,she was charged a late fee of three more times in july,september,and october.in december,however,she made a payment of within the grace period.nonetheless,lendmark charged her a late fee because it applied that month payment first to prior late fees and then to interest and principal,thereby,according to lendmark,leaving her with only a partial payment of interest and principal.the same circumstances occurred for her february payment.after march,williams payments were mostly made in amounts less than the specified in the note,and she incurred late fees on each of those occasions.long after the maturity of the note,williams finally paid off the entire loan,having been charged more than late fees.
williams commenced this action in the circuit court for baltimore city,alleging that lendmark charged numerous late fees in violation of clec,the note,and other state law obligations.lendmark removed the case to federal court under diversity jurisdiction and thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.the district court granted the motion as to all claims except williams claim that lendmark assessed late fees prior to the expiration of her day grace period,in breach of the note terms and of clec.after full discovery,however,the district court granted lendmark summary judgment,dismissing this claim also.
from the district court judgment dated july,williams filed this appeal,raising three issues whether lendmark application of installments first to late fees,then to interest,and finally to principal violated clec and the note whether lendmark imposition of late fees on installments made in december and february,which were timely made,violated clec and the note and whether lendmark posting of late fees on its books after the close of business on the fifth day of the grace period violated clec and the note.
williams contends first that the district court erred in approving lendmark application of williams payments first toward late fees,then toward interest and last toward principal.she argues that the practice of applying payments first to late fees violated clec.code,com.law c requiring that all payments by the borrower shall be applied to satisfaction of scheduled payments in the order in which they become due emphasis added,because late fees were not part of any scheduled payment of principal and interest.
lendmark contends that its practice of applying williams payments first to late charges then to accrued interest and then to the principal was consistent with not only the terms of her promissory note but also of clec,which authorizes a credit grantor to charge a late fee if the agreement,note,or other evidence of the loan permits.code,com.law b.we agree.
clec expressly allows a creditor to impose late charges.code,com.law a i,but it limits the manner in which such late charges may be imposed,providing 
b in the case of a loan to a consumer borrower,no late or delinquency charge may be charged unless the agreement,note,or other evidence of the loan permits.no more than late or delinquency charge may be imposed for any single payment or portion of payment,regardless of the period during which it remains in default.
c for the purposes of subsection b of this section,all payments by the borrower shall be applied to satisfaction of scheduled payments in the order in which they become due.
id.b,c emphasis added.
in this case,the promissory note that williams signed did permit lendmark to impose late charges,as authorized by clec 
late charge if williams do es not pay any installment within days after its scheduled or deferred due date,williams agree s to pay a late charge of the greater of of the unpaid amount of the installment or.only one late charge shall be charged on any installment or part of an installment.for the purpose of computing late charges,all payments by williams shall be applied to scheduled payments in the order they become due.the late charge will be in addition to daily accrued interest.
to make her argument,williams urges an interpretation of clec and the note that would require that each payment be applied only to interest and principal,leaving for some later unspecified date the payment of late charges.but her argument is not supported by either the language of the note or by clec.
contrary to her suggestion that a scheduled payment can only include interest and principal,the note simply defines a monthly payment or monthly installment to be a payment of,payable the first day of each month.nowhere does it break down the amount into components.
to be sure,the monthly payment amount of was calculated based on the amortization of principal and the applicable interest rate over monthly payments.but it does not follow that lendmark must apply each monthly payment only to principal and interest.indeed,what williams agreed in the note to pay each month is separate from how lendmark agreed to apply those payments.
in an effort to render her obligation to make monthly payments of somehow inapplicable to prior late charges,williams relies on language in the note that all payments by her shall be applied to scheduled payments in the order they become due.emphasis added.she points to similar language in clec.see.code,comm.law c providing that all payments by the borrower shall be applied to satisfaction of scheduled payments in the order in which they become due emphasis added.but williams takes the language from both the note and clec out of context.in both locations,the language was included for the purpose of calculating and app
