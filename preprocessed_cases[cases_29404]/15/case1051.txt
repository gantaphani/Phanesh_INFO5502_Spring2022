on this petition for writ of mandate,petitioner people of the state of california seek to set aside discovery orders made by the court related to real parties in interest cole national corporation,cole national group,cole vision corporation,cole vision services,pearle,pearle vision,pearle visioncare,and stanley pearle collectively,cole request for production of documents and deposition notices directed to the people.the court ordered that the people produce all documents responsive to cole request for production of documents,regardless of whether they were privileged or confidential,unless the people had raised a specific objection as to particular documents produce documents in the possession of nonparty state agencies produce without objection documents produced by the people in a separate federal court action that were the subject of a protective order produce for deposition persons most knowledgeable at nonparty state agencies and not raise any objections to the deposition notices or at the depositions that were raised with regard to cole request for production of documents.
the people filed this petition,asserting that the court abused its discretion in making those discovery orders as they raised timely objections under code of civil procedure section on the grounds of privilege to cole request for production of documents and served a privilege log,and the court never ordered that they produce a more detailed log or objections they were not required to produce documents in the possession of nonparty state agencies they were not required to produce for deposition witnesses from nonparty state agencies and they were not required to produce documents subject to a protective order in the federal court action unless a similar protective order was entered into in this action.we grant the people petition,with instructions.
factual and procedural background 
a.the pleadings 
the people complaint charged pearle,pearle,an optician and retailer of eyeglasses,and pearle visioncare,pearle visioncare,a provider of optometry services,with violating business and professions code sections and,which govern the practice of optometry and prohibit opticians and eyeglass retailers from advertising optometric services,and forbid opticians and eyeglass retailers from having financial connections with optometrists,as well as other practices.pearle and pearle visioncare filed a against the attorney general of the state of california attorney general and kathleen hamilton,director of the department of consumer affairs director,alleging that the laws regulating relationships between retailers and optometrists,including business and professions code sections and,violated the commerce,equal protection,and due process clauses,as well as the first amendment of the federal constitution.pearle and pearle visioncare also asserted that they were not subject to business and professions code sections and because pearle visioncare was an approved provider under the healthcare service plan act act,and thus exempt from those provisions.
injunction and first appeal 
the people filed a motion for preliminary injunction,seeking to enjoin pearle from advertising eye exams and to enjoin pearle visioncare from charging a fee for dilating patients eyes with eye drops.the court granted the people request for a preliminary injunction,prohibiting pearle from disseminating advertising in california that would mislead consumers into believing that it employed optometrists.the order further provided that pearle could still mention eye examinations,doctors and optometrists in its advertisements as long as they contained a disclaimer that pearle did not employ optometrists or provide eye exams in california.the court also enjoined pearle visioncare from charging a fee for dilating patients eyes with eye drops.
pearle and pearle visioncare and the people appealed from the order granting the preliminary injunction.in a published opinion filed on november,cole i,we affirmed in part and reversed in part.we first concluded that the court properly enjoined pearle advertising,as it was both illegal and misleading.however,we also concluded that the court erred in allowing pearle to continue advertising optometric services if it also provided a disclaimer that pearle visioncare provided those services.we further concluded that the court erred in enjoining pearle visioncare from charging a fee for dilating patients eyes with eye drops,and we rejected the people other objections to the terms of the injunction.on march,the california supreme court granted pearle and pearle visioncare petition for review,and the matter is presently pending before that court.
demurrer and second appeal 
the attorney general and director demurred to pearle and pearle visioncare,arguing that their claims failed as matter of law.the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and the court dismissed appellants.pearle and pearle visioncare appealed that judgment.pearle vision,v.the people ex rel.bill lockyer.on april,we ordered the appeal stayed based upon the parties request and stipulation,pending the california supreme court resolution of the issues pending in cole 
federal court litigation 
in july,lenscrafters,eye care center of america and the national association of optometrists and opticians naoo,filed a civil rights action under united states code in the united states district court for the eastern district of california,against the attorney general and the department of consumer affairs dca,challenging the constitutionality of business and professions code sections and naoo case or federal case.
in august,the parties in the naoo case entered into a stipulation and protective order,whereby the people and dca agreed to produce to the plaintiffs in that action certain documents they asserted were confidential or privileged,upon the agreement that the plaintiffs in that case would not disclose them outside of that litigation.the attorney general and the dca produced documents to the plaintiffs in the naoo case,along with a detailed privilege log of documents being withheld on the grounds of privilege.
discovery dispute 
in may,cole served a request for production of documents on the people,seeking production of categories of documents.the people filed timely responses,which contained objections based upon,attorney work product and official information privileges,and protections under the information practices act,et.the people also objected to cole definition of the words people and you and yours in the discovery requests as those terms could include nonparties,and to cole definition of what documents were within its possession,custody and control.
the people and cole began a meet and confer process wherein they discussed certain of the people responses and objections.in august,cole requested that the people provide a privilege log describing any documents that the people considered privileged and that should not be produced.
thereafter,all proceedings in the matter were stayed from october to february.on february,the day before the stay was to be lifted,the people provided a privilege log to cole.however,the privilege log listed categories of documents,rather than individual privileged documents.the people offered to amend the privilege log if cole requests for production were narrowed.the people and cole thereafter met and conferred concerning the privilege log,cole asserting that it was inadequate and that they would move to compel all documents being withheld on the basis of privilege if a more detailed log was not produced.
in march,cole brought a motion to compel production of documents.cole first objected to the people decision to identify responsive documents,as opposed to producing them to cole.cole also objected to the people identification only of documents that supported their claims,as opposed to ones that were responsive but might not support those claims.cole challenged three objections the people made to production that they need not produce documents that were in cole possession or matters of public record and therefore equally available to cole that production would be unduly burdensome and that their documents were organized in a manner that production would invade their work product privilege.cole also sought a ruling that the people boilerplate the requests for production were vague and ambiguous,without limitation as to scope and time,and constituted expert witness discovery were without merit.finally,cole sought an order compelling the people to provide a statement that they would comply with the request for production and produce all responsive documents.however,the motion specifically noted that it was not challenging the privileges asserted by the people in their response or privilege log as the parties were in the process of meeting and conferring concerning those objections,and that cole would reserve the right to subsequently challenge any privilege claims not resolved by the meet and confer process.the motion also did not seek to declare invalid the people general objections to cole definitions of people,you,yours,and what documents were considered to be in their possession,custody and control.
the people opposed the motion,asserting that the only documents that they did not produce were cole own documents and public filings that were equally available to cole.the people also asserted that its statement of compliance was proper.further,the people defended their objections based upon the manner that cole requests were framed.the people asserted that their objection that documents were equally available to cole was proper as to documents that were already in cole possession.the people objected to producing documents they had premarked as violative of the work product privilege.the people renewed their contention that the requests for production contained vague and ambiguous terms.the people also objected to the fact that the requests were not limited by time and asserted that the broadness of the requests implied that they sought expert witness discovery.the people did not discuss whether they were required to produce documents not in their immediate possession.the people also acknowledged that their objections on the grounds of privilege were not the subject of the motion and asserted that cole had waived the right to challenge those objections by not addressing them in the motion.
in cole reply brief,they disputed the fact that they had waived the right to challenge the people privilege objections and noted that the parties were still meeting and conferring as to those issues and that they would be the subject of a separate motion.
the matter was assigned to a discovery referee,the honorable arthur jones ret.judge jones recommended that the motion be granted in its entirety and that all objections be overruled,with the exception of any claims of privilege as assertions of privilege were not raised by the motion and such are reserved for further hearing if necessary.the referee report made clear that its recommendations were only as to the requests and objections delineated in cole motion.judge jones did not discuss any issue or recommend any order beyond the issues raised by the parties in cole motion to compel.the court thereafter adopted the referee report.as to the people claims of privilege,the court order stated that their assertions of privilege in their february,privilege log are reserved from the motion and request for sanctions,and no ruling is made as to their validity and sufficiency.the court overruled the people objections to the document requests at issue on cole motion.the court ordered the people to produce all documents responsive to the requests enumerated in cole motion in the people possession,custody or control.neither the referee report nor the order addressed the people objections to the definitions of people,you,yours,and what documents were considered to be in their possession,custody or control.the people were ordered to produce all nonprivileged,responsive documents within days and serve a statement that they had complied with the request for production.
in august,the people submitted a statement of compliance in accordance with the court order and produced documents to cole.however,according to the people,they did not produce any privileged documents as such was not required by the court order,or documents in the possession of entities,such as nonparty state agencies,as it was their position that the motion to compel did not challenge the people objections that cole definitions of people,plaintiff,you and yours were overbroad as requiring production of documents in the possession of third parties.
thereafter,the parties entered into a series of stipulations extending the deadline for cole to bring a motion to compel concerning the people claims of privilege.at the same time,the people asserted a right to claim that cole had waived the right to bring a motion as to privileged documents by not bringing it as part of their original motion to compel documents.
in january,cole wrote a letter to counsel for the people,alleging that the people had improperly withheld documents from production.specifically,cole asserted that they had discovered from parties in the naoo action presumably,the plaintiffs in that action that the people had produced in the naoo action documents showing that state agencies had historically interpreted business and professions code sections and as not applying to entities such as pearle visioncare that were covered by the act.cole asserted that such documents were within the scope of their requests for production and subject to the court order compelling production.the people responded,requesting information as to the manner in which the documents were obtained,and what documents were obtained,so that they could determine whether they were subject to any privilege objections or the protective order in the naoo action.cole rejected that request and accused the people of concealing documents.the people responded by claiming the documents identified by cole were either not responsive to their requests or privileged.the parties continued to meet and confer regarding the issue,but without success.
in march,cole brought a motion entitled motion for an order requiring immediate production of critical documents concealed and withheld by the people.that motion sought an order compelling the people to produce copies of all documents produced by the attorney general or department of consumer affairs,including the medical board and board of optometry,in the federal action,whether or not designated confidential and without culling from these already produced documents those the state team would prefer were not produced original underscoring and reverify their responses to cole first set of production of documents that they were not withholding any documents on the basis they were in the files of a separate state agency,were confidential,or privileged,unless the people could show that a specific claim of privilege was made prior to february for a specific document.in addition to asserting that the people improperly withheld documents from state agencies allegedly interpreting application of business and professions code sections and,cole also accused the people of shredding relevant documents a year earlier.
the people opposed cole motion,asserting that cole had not challenged their objections on the grounds of privilege and to their not producing documents in the possession of third parties in their original motion to compel,and that they had therefore waived the right to pursue such documents.the people also argued that they had not waived the right to assert privileges by raising objections in their original responses to cole request for production of documents,and their privilege log.the people also asserted that cole could not seek discovery from nonparty state agencies through requests for production propounded on the people.the people asserted they had no obligation to turn over documents from the naoo case because the parties there were the attorney general and the dca the documents produced there came from nonparty state agencies and they were subject to a protective order and privileges raised in that action.the people also claimed that the state agency documents referred to by cole were irrelevant to the issues raised in this action because they were not formal interpretations of the act by agencies charged with enforcing its terms.
at the hearing on cole motion,the people argued that the parties had been meeting and conferring regarding their privilege objections,discovery had been stayed by the court,they had a supplemental privilege log ready to serve on cole,and that the parties had stipulated that the matter of privileges would be litigated at a later date.cole took the position that the court previous order granting their motion to compel ordered that all privileges were waived unless specifically listed in the people privilege log.the people requested permission to file a supplemental brief to address this contention and offered to attach a copy of the court prior order and a supplemental privilege log.
the court granted cole motion,finding that because of the state erroneous definition of applicable agencies status as agents of the party litigants and based on a failure to properly identify documents and assert privileges to the disputed documents,the court concludes plaintiff the people failed to comply with the letter and spirit of the court july,discovery order.the court ordered the people to produce copies of all documents produced by the attorney general or department of consumer affairs,including medical board and board of optometry,in the federal action,whether or not designated confidential or privileged.the court further ordered the people to reverify their responses to cole first set of requests for production,and to withhold no documents on the basis that the documents are a in the files of a separate government agency,b confidential,or c privileged unless the people can show that a specific claim of privilege was made at any time prior to february for that specific document.
during the pendency of cole discovery motion,they served a deposition notice and document production request on the people,seeking to depose the person or persons most knowledgeable for the department of consumer affairs,california medical board and board of optometry.the people filed a motion to quash the deposition notice and for a protective order.the people objected to the deposition notices on grounds similar to their opposition to cole discovery motion that it was not proper to serve them with deposition notices for production of nonparty state agencies and the notice sought information protected by the and attorney work product privileges.
the court denied both the motion to quash and the motion for a protective order.in doing so,the court stated 
the plaintiff is reminded that the people objections are overruled.in the future,the court does not anticipate the people will any of the objections raised by these motions or raised within defendants april motion for immediate production.the court is mindful,however,that during the subject depositions the people have the right to assert certain meritorious objections that fall outside the scope of these motions.
the people filed this petition seeking to overturn the court order granting cole motion to compel and denying their motion to quash and for protective order and requested that we stay the matter.we stayed all further discovery in the matter and issued an order to show cause why the people petition should not be granted.
discussion 
relief appropriate by mandate 
interlocutory review by writ is the only adequate remedy where a court orders production of documents which may be subject to a privilege,since once privileged matter has been disclosed there is no way to undo the harm which consists in the very disclosure.citation.the privilege deserves a particularly high degree of protection in this regard since it is a legislatively created privilege protecting important public policy interests,particularly the confidential relationship of attorney and client and their freedom to discuss matters in confidence.citations.korea data systems superior court th,d korea data.

iii.analysis 
the people assert that the court abused its discretion and erred as a matter of law in entering its discovery orders because they raised timely objections on the grounds of privilege to cole request for production of documents and served a privilege log and the court never ordered that they produce a more detailed log or objections they were not required to produce documents in the possession of nonparty state agencies nor witnesses from nonparty state agencies for deposition and they were not required to produce documents subject to a protective order in the federal court action unless a similar protective order was entered into in this action.we address each of these contentions in turn.
a.the claims of privilege 
in korea data,supra,th,d,the defendant served the plaintiff with a request for production of documents.the plaintiff served a timely but nonspecific response,which included general objections based upon the privilege and the work product doctrine.the defendant filed a motion pursuant to section,subdivision l,seeking further responses in compliance with the specificity requirements of section,subdivision f and to compel the plaintiff to serve a privilege log.the plaintiff opposed the motion but served a privilege log shortly after being served with the motion.the court appointed a discovery referee to handle the discovery dispute.the referee issued a report recommending that the defendant motion be granted and that objections to all the document sic demand ed,including those objections on and work product grounds set forth in petitioners untimely privilege log provided only after this motion was filed,are overruled korea data,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff filed objections to the report and moved the referee to relieve them from the waiver under section,subdivision k the motion was denied.the trial court then adopted the referee recommendations and found a waiver of the and work product privileges.korea data,supra,at,d.
the plaintiff filed a petition for writ of mandate,which the court of appeal granted.in doing so,the court of appeal stated,we agree with plaintiff claim that the court erred in finding the privilege waived by the untimely filing of a privilege log.section,subdivision k provides in part if a party to whom an inspection demand has been directed fails to serve a timely response to it,that party waives any objection to the demand,including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under section.here,plaintiff filed timely objections to the discovery,albeit boiler plate objections lacking the specificity the statute mandates.while the code calls for more specific responses than were originally provided,and while we recognize the use of boiler plate objections as were provided in this case may be sanctionable,the appropriate sanction is not a judicially imposed waiver of the privilege.korea data,supra,th at,d.
a similar result was reached in the recent case best products,superior court th,d best products.there,plaintiff served a set of requests for production of documents and special interrogatories.the defendant responded to both discovery requests with boilerplate objections,including privilege and work product privilege.a meet and confer process did not resolve the parties differences about the defendant boilerplate objections.the plaintiff then filed two motions.one was a motion to provide a full and complete statement of compliance,without further objection,to plaintiff first set of requests for production of documents.the plaintiff also asserted that if the defendant intended to raise the privilege,it must prepare a privilege log setting forth sufficient information to determine whether or not any privilege applied.the plaintiff argued that the defendant failure to do so was an implicit admission that the objection based upon privilege should be overruled.plaintiff other motion was to compel further responses to its interrogatories,also without objection.id.at,d.
at the hearing on the plaintiff motion,the defendant informed the court that it was in the process of preparing a privilege log.however,the court ruled that the privilege log was untimely and overruled the defendant objections on the grounds of privilege.best products,supra,th at,d.the defendant filed a petition for writ of mandate,which,as in korea data,the court of appeal granted.
in granting the defendant petition for writ of mandate and finding that the court had erred in overruling the defendant privilege objections,the court stated the trial court effectively held that defendant had waived its right to assert the and work product privileges because it had failed to file a privilege log in regard to plaintiff request to inspect and produce.that ruling was error.statutory law recognizes only three methods by which a party can waive a privilege.two are found in evidence code section and are inapplicable to this cause.the one pertinent to this proceeding is found in section,subdivision l.it provides if a party to whom an inspection demand has been directed fails to serve a timely response to it,that party waives any objection to the demand,including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under section.consequently,only if defendant had failed to file a timely response to plaintiff demand can the court find a waiver of privilege.there is absolutely no requirement that a privilege log be tendered at this point of the discovery proceedings.citation.because defendant did assert the and work product privileges in a timely manner,albeit in a boilerplate fashion,the court erred in finding a waiver of privilege s.best products,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted.
to a certain extent,it appears that the trial court misapprehended the stage of a proceeding at which a privilege log becomes relevant.as we recently explained t he expression,privilege log,does not appear in section or anywhere else in the code of civil procedure.the expression is jargon,commonly used by courts and attorneys to express the requirements of subdivision g of section.citations.the purpose of a privilege log is to provide a specific factual description of documents in aid of substantiating a claim of privilege in connection with a request for document production.citation.the purpose of providing a specific factual description of documents is to permit a judicial evaluation of the claim of privilege.citations.citation.best products,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
the need for a privilege log could have arisen had plaintiff properly moved to compel further responses to contest defendant conclusory and work product objections.subdivision m of section provides if the party demanding an inspection,on receipt of a response to an inspection demand,deems an objection in the response is without merit or too general,that party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand.in that context,defendant could be required to produce a privilege log that is sufficiently specific so the trial court could determine whether a specific document is or is not privileged.plaintiff,however,did not rely upon that statutory provision in bringing its motion.in any event,even had plaintiff brought and prevailed on a motion on that statutory ground,the court could not find a waiver of privilege.the statute authorizes the court to make orders compelling further responses that adequately identify and describe documents for which a party here,defendant has raised boilerplate assertions of the and work product privileges.if defendant fails to comply with such an order,section sets forth the exclusive remedies available to the court.the trial court can make those orders that are just,including the imposition of an issue sanction,an evidence sanction,or a terminating sanction under section.in lieu of or in addition to that sanction,the court could impose a monetary sanction under section,subd.m.however,even at that juncture,the statute does not include as an authorized sanction a judicial order that a privilege has been waived.best products,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted see also hernandez superior court th,d.
korea data and best products dictate that the court erred in overruling the people privilege objections in this case.
first,it is undisputed that the people original response was timely and contained objections on the grounds of privilege.the people thereafter,although not required to,produced a privilege log.because the people timely objected on the grounds of privilege,they preserved these objections,regardless of whether the objections were sufficiently detailed in their response or privilege log and the court,as a matter of law,could not find that they had waived these privileges,subd.l korea data,supra,th at,d best products,supra,th at,d.
further,no motion was made under section,subdivision m seeking a further and more specific identification of documents withheld on the basis of privilege,either by a further response or a more detailed privilege log.only had such a motion been made,would the need for a privilege log have even have arisen.best products,supra,th at,d.even if such a motion were brought,and the court ordered a more specific description of the privileges raised and documents withheld,and the party thereafter failed to comply with the order,the court would still be in error if it ordered privileges waived.in such a case,the court could make those orders that are just,including the imposition of an issue sanction,an evidence sanction,or a terminating sanction under section.in lieu of or in addition to that sanction,the court could impose a monetary sanction under section,subd.m.however,even at that juncture,the statute does not include as an authorized sanction a judicial order that a privilege has been waived.best products,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
cole points to deficiencies in the people privilege log and asserts that because the people never produced a proper one,the court properly ordered any privileges not adequately stated therein to be waived.however,as detailed above,this argument is unavailing.first,deficient objections or claims of privilege are not grounds for waiver,so long as a party,such as the people here,made timely objections in their original response.further,there is no obligation to produce a privilege log at all,unless ordered to do so by the court upon a motion by a party seeking such a document.no such motion was made,and no such order was entered.second,even if the court had ordered the people to produce a privilege log,or to produce a more detailed one,and the people failed to do so,no waiver of privileges could be found.while the court would have other sanctions available to it in such a situation,a waiver of privileges was not authorized by statute.
cole remedy at this point is to compel the people to produce a more detailed privilege log.then,if the people fail to do so,or their response is inadequate,they may seek relief from the court pursuant to section,subdivision m.however,to be clear,even at that stage cole could not seek a waiver of any privileges raised.thus,the court erred as a matter of law in ordering the people to produce documents without regard to whether they were privileged and that in response to cole subpoenas they produce documents and witnesses without objection on the basis of privilege.we therefore grant the people petition and order the court to set aside these orders.
discovery related to other state agencies
