factual and procedural background 
first american call recording system 
first american issues home warranty plans to customers in states,including california.the plans typically cover the major systems and appliances in a customer home.
customers may make warranty claims with first american by calling an number printed on the warranty contract.in addition,first american inside sales group makes outbound calls to existing customers as part of various marketing campaigns or to solicit customers to renew their home warranty contracts.
all calls between first american and its customers whether inbound calls by the customer or outbound calls by the inside sales group are recorded by first american voice print international,vpi system.the vpi system is a call recording system.the recording equipment can not be turned off by the inside sales group representatives who make outbound calls.
a customer placing an inbound call to first american is greeted with the following automated disclosure regarding call monitoring or recording first american home buyer protection your first choice in home warranty.to ensure the highest quality service your call may be monitored or recorded.the customer can not bypass the disclosure.
the automated disclosure regarding call monitoring or recording is not played when a customer receives an outbound call from the inside sales group.prior to,first american also did not have a policy requiring inside sales group representatives to advise customers that outbound calls would be recorded nor did first american sales,policy,and procedure manual provide inside sales group representatives with directions for advising customers that calls would be recorded.
plaintiff call history with first american 
in april,plaintiff purchased a first american home warranty plan.she renewed her plan annually for the next three years,until it expired on may.
between april,and may,the date plaintiff received her first outbound call from an inside sales group representative,plaintiff made approximately inbound calls to first american to either renew her warranty plan,or to make,or on,warranty claims she had made pursuant to the plan.during each of those inbound calls,plaintiff was advised by first american automated disclosure that the call may be monitored or recorded.plaintiff never told the first american representative that she refused to be recorded and she never terminated the call to avoid being recorded.
apart from her interactions with first american,plaintiff also confirmed that she had participated in dozens and dozens and dozens of telephone calls with companies where she understood her call could be recorded or monitored for quality assurance.as with her calls to first american,plaintiff did not object to being recorded during any of these calls.
on may,plaintiff received an outbound call from first american inside sales group.on may,plaintiff received another outbound call from the inside sales group.each call was recorded by first american vpi system.the recordings confirmed that plaintiff did not receive a disclosure that the calls would be recorded.
the operative second amended complaint 
plaintiff operative second amended complaint asserts a single cause of action for statutory invasion of privacy in violation of section on behalf of plaintiff and other current,former and prospective customers of first american whose telephone conversations were recorded without the customers knowledge or consent.the complaint seeks statutory penalties pursuant to section of per violation of section,injunctive relief,and attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
plaintiff motion for class certification 
plaintiff moved for certification of an class defined as follows all persons within the state of california who received telephone calls from employees,agents or representatives of first american home buyers protection corporation inside sales division and whose telephone conversation s were recorded without warning from july,to october.
with respect to the community of interest requirement,plaintiff argued that common issues of law and fact predominated because first american was the only defendant first american policy was to record all outbound calls by its inside sales group the outbound calls were not preceded by an automated warning that the call would be recorded and prior to,first american did not direct its inside sales group to advise customers it was recording outbound calls.plaintiff also maintained that the two outbound calls she received were typical of those received by other putative class members,and that she and her counsel would fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
first american opposition to class certification 
in opposition to plaintiff class certification motion,first american principally argued that plaintiff section claim presented numerous individual factual issues.among other things,first american argued that specific factual findings were required to be made to determine whether an individual plaintiff reasonably believed that his or her call with the inside sales group would not be recorded.in that regard,first american contended that each putative class member unique experiences including the length of the class member relationship with first american,the number of times the class member heard first american automated disclosure regarding the recording of inbound calls,and the class member experience with other businesses that monitor calls for quality assurance would be relevant to assessing whether a particular class member reasonably believed an outbound call from first american would not be recorded.
in support of the contention,first american cited plaintiff unique circumstances and experience,the dozen or so inbound calls plaintiff made to first american in which she was repeatedly advised the call may be monitored or recorded.first american also presented the declaration of its marketing expert,linda golden,who conducted an internet survey of california homeowners to determine customer expectations regarding call monitoring and recording for quality assurance.the survey results showed that percent of qualified participants would expect a call from a company to be monitored or recorded for quality assurance if they had received an automated disclosure during a prior call to the company advising that the call may be monitored or recorded.
additionally,because section does not apply to a radio device,first american argued that plaintiff claim raised individualized questions concerning whether each outbound call was received via a landline,cellular or cordless telephone.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court ruled that plaintiff failed to meet her burden to establish an ascertainable class,predominate common factual questions,and the superiority of a class action.
on commonality,the trial court found that an individual inquiry was required to determine whether each putative class member had an objectively reasonable expectation that his or her telephone conversation with first american would not be recorded.the court rejected plaintiff contention that the objective reasonableness of each plaintiff expectation could be assessed by reference to first american uniform call recording procedures.on the contrary,the court found the reasonableness of an individual plaintiff expectation will vary depending on his or her past experiences with first american,including the number of calls the individual previously made to first american in which he or she was advised that the call would be monitored or recorded.
the trial court also found that a inquiry would be required to determine whether a landline,cellular or cordless telephone had been used to receive a particular outbound call.plaintiff conceded that the operative second amended complaint pled only a cause of action for violation of section,which does not apply to cellular or cordless telephones,but argued that this should not defeat commonality because the complaint could be amended to assert a claim under section,which prohibits recording or eavesdropping upon cellular or cordless telephone calls.plaintiff,however,did not file a motion to amend,nor did she present a declaration addressing the factors specified in rule of the california rules of court the trial court expressed concern that due process required plaintiff to bring a motion,to which first american would have an opportunity to respond,before the court could consider granting leave to amend the complaint.plaintiff conceded the point and agreed to make a formal motion asking the court to amend the complaint to include a section claim 
discussion 
class certification principlesa.standard of review 
code of civil procedure section authorizes class actions when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court the party seeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among class members.citation.sav on drug stores,superior court cal th,sav on.the party also must demonstrate there are substantial benefits from certification that render proceeding as a class superior to the alternatives.brinker restaurant superior court cal th,brinker.
as trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.sav on,supra,cal th at.thus,in the absence of other error,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation citation.under this standard,an order based upon improper criteria or incorrect assumptions calls for reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.citations.linder thrifty oil cal th.accordingly,on appeal from the denial of class certification,we review the reasons given by the trial court for denial of class certification,and ignore any unexpressed grounds that might support denial.kaldenbach mutual of omaha life ins.th.we may not reverse,however,simply because some of the court reasoning was faulty,so long as any of the stated reasons are sufficient to justify the order.citation.ibid.
predominate common questions requirement 
the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.brinker,supra,cal th at.the p laintiffs have the burden to establish the requisite community of interest and that questions of law or fact common to the class predominate over the questions affecting the individual members.citation.lockheed martin superior court cal th.
common issues are predominant when they would be the principal issues in any individual action,both in terms of time to be expended in their proof and of their importance citation.a class action can not be maintained where each member right to recover depends on facts peculiar to his case because the community of interest requirement is not satisfied if every member of the alleged class would be required to litigate numerous and substantial questions determining his individual right to recover citation.citation.caro procter gamble th.presented with a class certification motion,a trial court must examine the plaintiff theory of recovery,assess the nature of the legal and factual disputes likely to be presented,and decide whether individual or common issues predominate.brinker,supra,cal th at.proof of most of the important issues as to the named plaintiffs must supply the proof as to all members of the class.see vasquez superior court cal d.
although on review we assume all causes of action have merit,issues affecting the merits of a case may be enmeshed with class action requirements citations.when evidence or legal issues germane to the certification question bear as well on aspects of the merits,a court may properly evaluate them.citations.the rule is that a court may consider how various claims and defenses relate and may affect the course of the litigation even though such considerations may overlap the case merits.citations.brinker,supra,cal th at.more specifically,whether an element may be established collectively or only individually,plaintiff by plaintiff,can turn on the precise nature of the element and require resolution of disputed legal or factual issues affecting the merits.id.at.
predominance is a factual question accordingly,the trial court finding that common issues predominate generally is reviewed for substantial evidence.citation.we must p resum e in favor of the certification order the existence of every fact the trial court could reasonably deduce from the record citation.brinker,supra,cal th at.
with these rules in mind,we turn to plaintiff claim under section and the trial court ruling denying class certification.
a communication is confidential under section if a party has an objectively reasonable expectation that the conversation is not being overheard or recorded 
section,part of california invasion of privacy act privacy act,prohibits the intentional recording of a confidential communication without the consent of all parties to the communication.specifically,section,subdivision a imposes liability on e very person who,intentionally and without the consent of all parties to a confidential communication,by means of any electronic amplifying or recording device,eavesdrops upon or records the confidential communication,whether the communication is carried on among the parties in the presence of one another or by means of a telegraph,telephone,or other device,except a radio italics added.
section,subdivision c defines the term confidential communication to include any communication carried on in circumstances as may reasonably indicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined to the parties thereto,but excludes a communication made in a public gathering or in any legislative,judicial,executive or administrative proceeding open to the public,or in any other circumstance in which the parties to the communication may reasonably expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded.italics added.
in flanagan,supra,cal th,our supreme court granted review to resolve two conflicting lines of cases pertaining to the meaning of confidential communication under section.one line of authority known as the frio test held that under section confidentiality appears to require nothing more than the existence of a reasonable expectation by one of the parties that no one is listening in or overhearing the conversation.frio superior court d,frio.under this line of authority,a plaintiff proves a conversation is
