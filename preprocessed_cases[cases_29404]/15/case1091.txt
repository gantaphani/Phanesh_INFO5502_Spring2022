the legislature enacted the credit services act of csa,et in response to certain business practices of credit services organizations.these organizations offer to obtain credit or improve the credit standing of consumers who have experienced credit problems.the csa sought to provide consumers with information necessary to decide whether or not to purchase such services,by requiring certain disclosures and by mandating that every credit services contract be in writing and signed by the buyer.in this case,as a matter of first impression,we address a common question arising in a novel context.consistent with the csa,may a credit services organization modify its membership contract to require arbitration and preclude class relief by the simple expedient of notifying its members by mail that continued membership constitutes acceptance of the modification we conclude it may not,because the csa requires that contract modifications be signed.we further conclude that this requirement is not preempted by the federal arbitration act and affirm the trial court order denying in part the motion of defendants to compel arbitration.
in addition,defendants attempt to appeal from a separate order of the trial court granting class action certification and from a third order denying in part their motion to define the scope of the class.because defendants have no right of appeal from the orders granting class certification and defining the scope of the class,we dismiss the appeals from those orders for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
in july,plaintiff dadra mitchell filed this class action suit against defendants,alleging plaintiff and the members of the class were solicited by defendants to participate in a credit repair scheme in which participants pay in excess of to join a membership club that provides credit education materials and an unsecured visa credit card with a credit limit.the operative complaint alleges defendants misrepresent that members of afca will rebuild their damaged credit ratings through use of the education materials and the unsecured visa card.the complaint asserts causes of action for violation of the csa,violation of the consumers legal remedies act,et,business practices bus,et,and false and misleading advertising bus,et.the complaint seeks injunctive relief,in addition to compensatory damages,restitution and attorney fees.
in january,six months after mitchell filed the present lawsuit,afca changed its membership rules,obligating all new members to sign a separate agreement to arbitrate as part of the membership application process.afca also attempted to modify the terms of its membership agreement with existing afca members to require the arbitration of all disputes with afca as a condition of continued membership in afca.
on april,the trial court granted plaintiff motion for class certification,certifying a class consisting of all california residents who have entered into a membership contract with afca up to the present date,without prejudice to defendant seeking to narrow class membership during the course of this litigation.on may,afca petitioned this court for a writ of mandate seeking to direct the trial court to vacate its order of class certification.this court denied afca writ petition on the ground that it failed to establish the propriety of writ review 
on june,defendants filed a motion in the trial court to compel arbitration by all persons who joined afca beginning in january,along with all existing members who impliedly agreed to the change in their membership agreement requiring arbitration by failing to cancel their memberships.the motion excluded plaintiff mitchell,who defendants acknowledge had ceased her membership with afca before afca implemented its arbitration provision in january.
concurrently,defendants filed a motion for an order defining the scope of the class,arguing,among other things,that the trial court should narrow the scope of the certified class to exclude all those afca members subject to the arbitration provision.defendants also sought an order narrowing the class definition to exclude persons whose claims were barred under the applicable statutes of limitation,and to exclude from the class persons who did not receive the same representations about afca that plaintiff purportedly received.
by separate orders entered october,the trial court granted in part and denied in part both motions.with respect to those class members who joined afca after january,and executed signed arbitration agreements,the court severed the claims for injunctive relief from the claims for damages or restitution and granted defendants motion to compel arbitration of the monetary claims only.however,the trial court denied defendants motion to compel arbitration for class members who received mailed notices of modification of their afca membership agreement unless signed arbitration agreements were executed by such class members.furthermore,citing broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d,the trial court denied in its entirety defendants motion to compel arbitration for the claims for injunctive relief.
the trial court order regarding defendants motion to define the scope of the class was consistent with its order regarding the motion to compel arbitration.the trial court severed from the class action the monetary claims for damages and restitution of members who joined afca after january,and had executed signed arbitration agreements.further,the court excluded from the class those persons whose claims the trial court found were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.in all other respects,the trial court denied the motion.this appeal followed.
discussion 
appealability of orders re class certification and scope of class 
ii.the order partially denying the motion to compel arbitration 
afca members who never signed the january modification 
we consider whether the trial court correctly refused to compel arbitration for afca members who joined the organization before arbitration was mandatory and never signed the modification proposed by afca before january.we review the trial court partial denial of the motion to compel arbitration de novo,since the trial court resolved no factual disputes in ruling on the motion.norcal mutual ins.newton th,d.
in january,afca sent its existing members a letter informing them that afca has amended your membership agreement to provide for dispute resolution through arbitration.the letter stated that it enclosed a copy of the arbitration of disputes provision and said it would become effective on january.the letter encouraged the members to read this document the arbitration of disputes agreement very carefully as it does affect your rights to go to court,to have a jury trial,to engage in discovery or to be included as a member of any class of claimants with respect to any dispute.
the final paragraph of the letter informed the members they had the right to reject this change in their agreement and then stated the affirmative steps that each was obliged to take in order to opt out.members would have to write afca before january,and state that they rejected the arbitration provision.you must give this notice in writing it is not sufficient to telephone us.the final sentence of the afca letter notified the members that,by continuing their membership beyond january,they would be agreeing to abide by the arbitration provision.
modifications of credit services agreements must be signed 
defendants contend that the procedure they employed created a valid modification of the membership agreement.the membership agreement provided that t his contract may be amended or modified only by an instrument in writing.defendants argue,and we agree,that a written agreement or instrument in writing results when there is a writing containing all terms and acceptance by the party to be charged.ord,kovakovich d.in ord,the appellate court determined that a letter setting forth the terms of an attorney fee agreement sent to a client constituted an instrument in writing,for purposes of determining the length of the statute of limitations,even though the letter was never signed by the client.id.at.further,we agree with defendants that a consumer may be held to have accepted a written modification when the consumer receives notification of it,is provided an opportunity to accept or reject it,and accepts the modification according to the instructions provided.numerous federal cases have found an acceptance of a written modification when,as here,the consumer fails to opt out.see,bank one,coates d,marsh first usa bank.
the contract formation requirements of the csa,however,are determinative plaintiff persuaded the trial court that ord,kovakovich was inapposite because the csa requires that the contract,as modified,must not only be written,but signed.we agree.
the csa was enacted by the legislature,in part,to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices employed by some credit services organizations.civil code,subd.b.included in section is an express statement of legislative intent describing why it was enacted and how it should be interpreted a the ability to obtain and use credit has become of great importance to consumers,who have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining their credit worthiness and credit standing.as a result,consumers who have experienced credit problems may seek assistance from credit services organizations which offer to obtain credit or improve the credit standing of such consumers.certain advertising and business practices of some credit services organizations have worked a financial hardship upon the people of this state,often those who are of limited economic means and inexperienced in credit matters.credit services organizations have significant impact upon the economy and of this state and its people.b the purposes of this title are to provide prospective buyers of services of credit services organizations with the information necessary to make an intelligent decision regarding the purchase of those services and to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices.c this title shall be construed liberally to achieve these purposes.
civil code section lists more than a dozen activities in which credit services organizations may not engage.the list reflects abuses enumerated in the legislative history,which motivated adoption of the csa.state and consumer services agency,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess,pp.background.
in civil code section the legislature provided a set of protections to consumers.credit services contracts were required to be in writing and signed by the buyer,subd.a.each contract must include a series of specific advisements to the buyer,along with a full and detailed description of the services to be performed for the buyer and the charges for such services,subd.a.further,the credit services organization is required to attach to the contract a specifically worded notice of cancellation indicating there is a grace period following the date of signature during which the consumer may reconsider and cancel the contract.finally,a copy of the fully completed contract and all other documents that the credit services organization requires the buyer to sign are to be given to the buyer at the time they are signed,to assist in that reconsideration,subd.b.
our interpretation of the csa is guided by familiar principles.our primary duty is to give effect to the legislature intent,in a manner that advances the statute purpose.day city of fontana cal th,d.here,the legislature has expressly set out its intent to provide consumers with the information necessary to make intelligent purchasing decisions and to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive business practices,subd.b.to that end,it mandated that every contract between a consumer and a credit services organization be signed and contain certain disclosures.defendants argue that we should interpret the phrase every contract to mean only the initial contract they urge us to refuse to apply the csa contract formation requirements to modifications of credit services agreements.as an alternative,they propose that if the formation requirements do apply to contracts as modified,we should limit this application to modifications of the provisions that must be disclosed pursuant to civil code section,subdivisions a through.
we are unwilling to accept either proposed interpretation.first,when a material term in a contract is altered or added,a new agreement between the parties has been reached it certainly would not be unreasonable for the legislature to intend to extend the protections of the csa to credit services agreements as modified or to utilize the phrase every contract to manifest that intent.
moreover,if we were to choose the more restrictive interpretation put forward by defendants and exclude contracts as modified from the reach of the csa,we would seriously undermine the legislature purpose an unscrupulous provider of credit services could overcome the protections of this act simply by obtaining a buyer signed assent to one set of terms for the initial purchase of credit services and later modifying any of those terms by employing an procedure similar to the one used here.see.in view of the legislature directive that the csa be construed liberally to achieve its purposes,we conclude that the requirements of civil code section apply to credit services agreements as modified.
at oral argument,defendants contended that this interpretation would require that the disclosures mandated by the csa be repeated in every subsequent modification.we disagree.the statutory requirements are applied to the contract as modified,not to each modification.if the contract as modified contains the appropriate disclosures,they need not be repeated.a new signature is required,however,to encompass the additional or altered terms.
defendants alternative argument,that a new signature is required only if the modification affects any of the contract terms for which disclosure is required,is more congruent with the statutory goal,but is incompatible with the language of civil code section,subdivision a.the phrase every contract shall be in writing and include the following disclosures can fairly be interpreted to include all contracts as modified or none of them.the middle ground proposed by defendants could not be adopted without effectively rewriting the statute.this is a task we leave to the legislature in the event it chooses to reconsider the wording of its enactment.
the federal arbitration act does not preempt the csa 
should this court interpret the csa to require signed assent to the challenged modification,defendants contend it would be preempted by the federal arbitration act faa et.again,we disagree.
the faa was enacted to overcome the unwillingness of the courts to enforce agreements to arbitrate.as justice breyer has noted,this unwillingness could be traced to ancient times and the fight by british courts to extend their jurisdiction.when congress passed the arbitration act in,it was motivated,first and foremost,by a desire to change this antiarbitration rule.citation.it intended courts to enforce arbitration agreements into which parties had entered,citation,and to place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts,citations.terminix dobson,d allied see dean witter reynolds byrd,d.to effectuate that goal,the faa provides,in pertinent part,an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.hereafter section.
though the faa incorporates a strong federal policy of enforcing arbitration agreements armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,the policy does not arise until an enforceable agreement is established.whether there is an agreement to submit disputes to arbitration or reference does not turn on the existence of a public policy favoring alternative dispute resolution that policy,whose existence we readily acknowledge,does not even come into play unless it is first determined that the bank customers agreed to use some form of alternative dispute resolution to resolve disputes citations.badie bank of america th,d see victori
