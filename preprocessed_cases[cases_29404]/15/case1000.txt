several individuals commenced separate actions against owners and operators of grocery stores alleging that the defendants sold artificially colored farmed salmon without disclosing to consumers the artificial coloring.the actions were coordinated in farm raised salmon cases,judicial council coordination proceeding.the plaintiffs filed a coordinated complaint alleging as a class and representative action counts for unfair competition,violation of the consumers legal remedies act clra,et,false advertising,and negligent misrepresentation.the superior court sustained a demurrer to the complaint on the grounds that the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca et preempted each cause of action,that the dispute should be referred to the united states food and drug administration fda or the california department of health services dhs under the primary jurisdiction doctrine,and that the plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action for violation of the clra.in finding preemption the court relied primarily on section a of title united states code section a,which states that an action to enforce the fdca must be by and in the name of the united states.the plaintiffs appeal the judgment.
we conclude that in section a congress made clear its intention to preclude private enforcement of the fdca,that a state law private right of action based on an fdca violation would frustrate the purposes of exclusive federal and state governmental prosecution of the act,and that section a impliedly preempts all of the plaintiffs causes of action.we therefore affirm the judgment without reaching or discussing the other grounds asserted by the defendants in support of their demurrer.
factual and procedural background 
the plaintiffs in their consolidated and amended complaint filed in march allege that fish farmers feed farmed salmon the chemicals canthaxanthin and astaxanthin to obtain a color of flesh resembling that of wild salmon.they allege that the flesh of farmed salmon would appear grayish without the chemical additives and that consumers believe that the color of salmon is an indication of its origin,quality,freshness,flavor,and other characteristics.they allege that concerns have been raised about the potential health risks of consuming the artificial coloring agents in particular and salmon in general.the plaintiffs allege that the fdca and parallel state laws require food labeling to state that farmed salmon is artificially colored and that the defendants have failed to comply with those requirements.they allege that the failure to disclose the artificial color has caused consumers to believe that farmed salmon is wild salmon.
the complaint alleges counts for unfair and unlawful business acts and practices in violation of the unfair competition law bus,et unfair or deceptive trade practices under the clra false and misleading advertising in violation of the false advertising law bus,et and negligent misrepresentation.the laws alleged to be violated as a predicate for the unfair competition law count include provisions of the fdca and california sherman food,drug,and cosmetic law sherman law health,et,a provision of the clra,and penal code section.the complaint alleges a representative and class action on behalf of the plaintiffs and others similarly situated.
the defendants jointly demurred to the complaint on several grounds,including that section a expressly precludes a private right of action to enforce the fdca and therefore impliedly preempts an action under state law by a private party based on an fdca violation,and each count of the plaintiffs complaint is based on alleged violations of the fdca,so section a preempts all of the counts alleged in the complaint further consideration of the plaintiffs complaint by the court could conflict with regulation and enforcement by the fda or dhs,which have special competence in the area of food labeling,so the action should be dismissed under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and the plaintiffs failed to allege an affirmative representation as required in order to state a cause of action under civil code section,subdivision a,or.the defendants also moved to strike portions of the complaint.
the trial court sustained the demurrer to each count,with leave to amend,in an order filed on january.the court stated in its order that an alleged violation of the fdca can not provide the basis for a claim under the unfair competition law because section a explicitly bars a private right of action,quoting from our opinion in stevens superior court th,d.the order further stated that section a precludes private enforcement of the fdca,that alleged violations of the fdca are the sole basis for each count alleged in the complaint,and that section a therefore preempts each count.the court rejected the plaintiffs arguments that the primary jurisdiction doctrine does not apply and concluded that the doctrine applies.the court also concluded that a claim under the clra must be based on an affirmative statement of fact rather than an omission,and that the plaintiffs failed to allege an affirmative statement of fact.
the plaintiffs elected not to amend their complaint,but to challenge the sustaining of the demurrer on appeal from the judgment.the court entered a judgment of dismissal with prejudice on march.the plaintiffs have appealed from that judgment.
contentions 
the plaintiffs contend section a neither expressly nor impliedly preempts their state law causes of action the primary jurisdiction doctrine does not apply,and even if it did apply it would support only a stay rather than dismissal the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under the unfair competition law based on unfair,fraudulent,and unlawful business acts or practices and the undisclosed artificial coloring of farmed salmon is itself a false representation concerning its origin within the meaning of the clra.the defendants dispute each of these contentions and assert the arguments that they raised in the trial court.
