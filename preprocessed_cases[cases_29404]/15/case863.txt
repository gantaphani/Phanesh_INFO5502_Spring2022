background 
the complaint 
it is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.san mateo union high school dist.county of san mateo th,weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,i.this appeal comes before us after the trial court sustained safeway demurrer,holding that lewis allegations failed to state a claim.one would thus expect that lewis an appellant who presumably aspires to convince us that the trial court erred would summarize the allegations in his complaint that purportedly stated a claim.astonishingly,nowhere in his opening brief does he do so,at most sprinkling a handful of passing references to his allegations randomly throughout his brief we find this to be a curious appellate strategy,and not one we condone.
nevertheless,we have the benefit of the complaint in the record,which reveals that on august,lewis filed a putative class action against safeway,asserting one cause of action,for violation of song beverly.the complaint contained five paragraphs concerning the cause of action,alleging as follows 
on or about august,plaintiff entered defendants store at ventura,sherman oaks,ca to purchase an alcoholic beverage.
upon selection of an alcoholic beverage to purchase,plaintiff presented the item for payment to one of defendants employees at the checkout counter.the sales clerk informed plaintiff of the amount due for his purchase.plaintiff then swiped his credit card into the defendants terminal,resulting in the transfer of his name and credit card number into defendants computer system.
at that point,the clerk requested personal identification information from plaintiff in the form of plaintiff date of birth.believing he was required to provide the information as a condition of completing the transaction,plaintiff gave the clerk his date of birth.the clerk then entered plaintiff date of birth into the computerized cash register.
while defendants are required to verify that the person purchasing an alcoholic beverage is not under years of age see bus,there is no legal requirement that they record that information.in fact,most retail sellers of alcoholic beverages verify the purchaser date of birth without recording it.in other words,defendant is not obligated to collect and record the personal identification information by federal or state law or regulation.
defendant is not contractually obligated to provide personal identification information in order to complete the credit card transaction.
the remaining allegations in lewis complaint concerned the putative class on whose behalf lewis brought the action.his prayer for relief sought a civil penalty for himself and each member of the class,attorney fees,costs,and prejudgment interest.
safeway demurrer 
safeway demurred to the complaint,asserting four independent reasons lewis complaint failed to allege a violation of the act.first,safeway contended it was obligated by law to verify the date of birth of customers purchasing alcohol and to keep records of the sales,and its conduct therefore fell within an exception to the act for an obligation imposed by law.second,safeway contended that another exception to the act when personal identification information is required for a special purpose incidental but related to the credit card transaction applied.third,safeway contended that lewis did not allege he understood the request for his date of birth to be a condition for the completion of a credit card transaction as required for a violation of the act,instead merely alleging his belief that he was required to provide his date of birth as a condition of completing the transaction.finally,safeway contended that one date of birth is not personal identification information within the meaning of song beverly.
lewis opposed the demurrer,responding to each of safeway arguments.as to the exception,lewis contended that while safeway was required by law to verify that a purchaser of an alcoholic beverage was years old or older,it was not required by law to record the purchaser date of birth,and thus the exception did not apply.he also contended that the second exception,when personal identification information is required for a special purpose incidental to the transaction,required a factual showing such that its applicability could not be decided on demurrer.as to safeway third contention,lewis argued that he did adequately allege his belief that the credit card transaction would be declined unless he provided his date of birth.lastly,lewis contended that a date of birth is in fact personal identification information within the meaning of song beverly.
after safeway filed a reply,the trial court issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer.the tentative ruling was not contested,and it became the order of the court.
the court agreed with safeway that the exception for an obligation imposed by law barred lewis cause of action.as the court explained lewis does not deny that safeway had legal obligations under the alcoholic beverage control act business and professions code section,et.abca to verify the date of birth of customers purchasing alcoholic beverages and to keep written records of all sales transactions.lewis argues,however,that the abca does not explicitly require that the written records of sales include the date of birth.while this is an accurate statement,as far as it goes,it does not follow that the inclusion of the date of birth in the record of sale takes the sales transaction out of the legal obligation exception to the act.lewis has provided no authority to support the proposition that the act should be interpreted to impose a limitation upon the information recorded for purposes of compliance with business and professions code section when,and only when,the transaction in question includes the use of a credit card.the court thus sustained safeway demurrer,doing so without leave to amend because lewis did not suggest any factual allegations that could be added to the complaint to state a cause of action.
the court subsequently entered judgment for safeway,following which lewis timely appealed.
