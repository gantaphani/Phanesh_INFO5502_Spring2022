introduction 
the trial court sustained defendant daimlerchrysler corporation dcc demurrer to plaintiffs second amended complaint which alleged violations of the unfair competition law ucl and the consumer legal remedies act clra and sought declaratory relief.the alleged statutory violations were based on dcc use of tubular steel in the exhaust manifolds of certain of its vehicles instead of more durable and more expensive cast iron.we affirm because plaintiffs failed to state a claim under any of those causes of action.
there are two lines of appellate opinions addressing the definition of unfair within the meaning of the ucl in consumer actions.one line defines unfair as prohibiting conduct that is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers and requires the court to weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.smith state farm mutual automobile ins.th,d smith pastoria nationwide ins.th,d.the other line of cases holds that the public policy which is a predicate to a consumer unfair competition action under the unfair prong of the ucl must be tethered to specific constitutional,statutory,or regulatory provisions.scripps clinic superior court th,d scripps gregory albertson,th,d gregory.in this opinion,we analyze both tests,apply each to the allegations of the second amended complaint,and conclude the allegations do not satisfy either one.we respectfully suggest that our legislature and supreme court clarify the definition of unfair in consumer actions under the ucl.
the fraud prong of the ucl requires that members of the public are likely to be deceived by the challenged conduct schnall hertz th,d.the second amended complaint did not allege facts showing that members of the public would assume or expect dcc to use exhaust manifolds.
plaintiffs claim for violation of the clra fails because the second amended complaint did not allege facts showing dcc was bound to disclose its use of tubular steel exhaust manifolds or the failure to disclose that fact would be otherwise misleading.
finally,because plaintiffs claims for unfair competition and violation of the clra fail,plaintiffs cause of action for declaratory relief also fails to state a claim.
the allegations of the second amended complaint and procedural background 
kurt cotton and josh avery filed a proposed class action against dcc in november.in december,cotton and avery filed a first amended complaint which alleged five causes of action,including claims for violation of the ucl,violation of the clra,and declaratory relief.dcc demurred to the first amended complaint the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend based on the statute of limitations.cotton and avery moved for leave to file a second amended complaint to substitute joshua bardin for kurt cotton as the proposed class representative.the trial court granted the motion.
bardin and avery second amended complaint contained claims only for violation of the ucl,violation of the clra,and declaratory relief.the second amended complaint alleged dcc designed,manufactured,marketed,distributed sold liter,cylinder jeep grand cherokees for model years through,and jeep cherokees and jeep wranglers for model years through the vehicles,which contained exhaust manifolds made of tubular steel rather than cast iron the standard in the industry for vehicles such as jeeps has been to use cast iron exhaust manifolds,given the pronounced durability and longevity of cast iron dcc chose to utilize less expensive tubular steel exhaust manifolds in the vehicles which dcc knew prematurely cracked and failed much earlier than would a cast iron manifold dcc concealed these facts from the public for the purpose of a reaping excessive profits to the detriment of plaintiffs by selling replacement parts,and b gaining an unfair advantage over dcc competitors by reducing the cost of goods sold,increasing profits and gaining market share dcc knew as early as that the tubular steel exhaust manifolds would not last as long as the conventional cast iron exhaust manifolds and would fail at unacceptably high rates dcc concealed these facts from plaintiffs and the public in order to sell replacement parts,increase profits and gain market share because dcc omitted and concealed material facts about the exhaust manifolds from the public,members of the public were likely to have been deceived about the quality,performance,and durability of those manifolds dcc gained an unfair competitive advantage over other vehicle manufacturers and sellers who did not engage in the same deceptive conduct,and reaped additional profits through the sale of vehicles less expensive to make,and the sale of replacement parts dcc did not disclose that it attempted to and did redesign the tubular steel manifold in or about,secretly withdrew the original tubular steel manifold from the market and ceased selling the same,and ultimately abandoned the use of the cracked prone tubular steel manifold,returning to the accepted industry standard of a more expensive and durable cast iron exhaust manifold plaintiffs are lay persons and consumers,who reasonably rightfully assumed that the manifolds in dcc vehicles were quality components and that,if not,dcc would comply with its obligations under the law to fully and promptly disclose the known defect in the inferior tubular steel exhaust manifold by fair notice bardin purchased and owns a jeep wrangler for which he paid to replace the exhaust manifold discovered in august to be cracked of the bardin paid to replace the exhaust manifold went to dcc for the cost of the replacement part avery purchased and owns a jeep cherokee sport and in july,avery was advised the exhaust manifold of that vehicle was cracked,but he has not had it repaired or replaced.
dcc demurred to the second amended complaint.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,stating,i t is not necessary for a business practice to be unlawful in order to be subject to an action under the unfair competition law.the unfair standard,the second prong of business and professions code section,also provides an independent basis for relief.this standard is intentionally broad.the test of whether a business practice is unfair involves an examination of that practice impact on its alleged victim,balanced against the reasons,justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer.in brief,the court must weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim citations.citation.citation.an unfair business practice occurs when the practice offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.citation.here,the alleged business practice is not unfair for purposes of business and professions code section.the exhaust manifolds were not guaranteed to last as those contained in other automobiles.as discussed in regard to prior demurrers,there can not be a cause of action for breach of warranty with regard to the exhaust manifolds.plaintiffs claim the unfair business practice here is the failure of defendant to disclose the exhaust manifolds were not made from the cast iron,but from tubular steel,and that they had a higher than normal rate of premature failure.the failure to disclose such facts is not immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers in order to maintain a cause of action under section.the burden on automobile manufacturers to disclose alternative mediums used in component parts or other cost savings measures used in the manufacture of automobiles would be huge compared to the benefit received by the automobile purchasing public.because there is nothing inherently unfair about defendant conduct,the causes of action for declaratory relief and clra fail.plaintiffs appealed 
discussion 
we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.
on review of an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,our standard of review is de novo,we exercise our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.citation.santa teresa citizen action group state energy resources conservation development com.th,d.
plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for unfair competition.
plaintiffs argue the second amended complaint stated a claim for unfair competition by alleging dcc intentionally concealed a known defect in its jeep vehicles for the specific purpose of creating and maintaining a lucrative in the sale of replacement parts.they argue dcc actions violated the unfair and fraud prongs of the ucl.
the second amended complaint did not state a claim under the unfair prong of the ucl.
in analyzing whether the second amended complaint stated a claim for unfair competition based on the unfair prong of the ucl,we address the california supreme court decision in communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,whether the allegations of the second amended complaint satisfy the definition of unfair set forth in smith,supra,th,d whether the allegations of the second amended complaint satisfy the definition of unfair set forth in scripps,supra,th,d and the significant questions raised as a result of and the subsequent division of opinion of appellate courts regarding the definition of unfair in consumer ucl actions 
supra,cal th 
before the california supreme court decision in,supra,cal th,d,appellate courts had broadly construed the definition of the term unfair within the meaning of the ucl.see,people casa blanca convalescent homes,d.an unfair business practice occurs when it offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers state farm fire casualty superior court th,d the court must weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.
in,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court analyzed the definition of the term unfair in the context of a ucl action brought by several businesses against a competitor.the defendant,los angeles cellular telephone company,was licensed by the federal government to provide cellular telephone service in the los angeles area.id.at,d.in addition to selling cellular telephone service,cellular sold cellular telephones.ibid.several companies the plaintiffs,which were not licensed to provide cellular service and only sold cellular telephones,sued cellular for,inter alia,violation of the ucl on the ground cellular formulated a strategy of selling cellular telephones below cost in order to increase the number of subscribers to its cellular telephone service.id.at,d.following the close of the plaintiffs,the trial court granted cellular motion for judgment under code of civil procedure section,finding that because the plaintiffs claim under the unfair practices act failed,their ucl claim necessarily failed,at,d.the appellate court reversed the judgment as to the ucl claim only,and remanded that claim for retrial on the ground cellular actions might have resulted in a violation of the ucl.ibid.
in,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court discussed the broad scope of the ucl and how,unlike the unfair practices act,it does not proscribe specific practices.rather,it defines unfair competition to include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.citation.fn.omitted.its coverage is sweeping,embracing anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.citations.it governs business practices as well as injuries to consumers,and has as a major purpose the preservation of fair business competition.citations.by proscribing any unlawful business practice,business and professions code section borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.citations.however,the law does more than just borrow.the statutory language referring to any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent practice makes clear that a practice may be deemed unfair even if not specifically proscribed by some other law.because business and professions code section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.in other words,a practice is prohibited as unfair or deceptive even if not unlawful and vice versa.the court further stated the legislature intentionally made the ucl broad to enable judicial tribunals to deal with the innumerable new schemes which the fertility of man invention would contrive.id.at,d,when a scheme is evolved which on its face violates the fundamental rules of honesty and fair dealing,a court of equity is not impotent to frustrate its consummation because the scheme is an original one.
the supreme court acknowledged,a lthough the unfair competition law scope is sweeping,it is not unlimited.courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair,supra,cal th at,d.the court criticized prior appellate court definitions of unfair in people casa blanca convalescent homes,supra,d at page.and state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,th at page,d,as too amorphous and providing too little guidance to courts and businesses,at,d.the court stated,v ague references to public policy,for example,provide little real guidance.p ublic policy as a concept is notoriously resistant to precise definition,and courts should venture into this area,if at all,with great care and due deference to the judgment of the legislative branch,lest they mistake their own predilections for public policy which deserves recognition at law.citation.these concerns led us to hold that to establish the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy,the public policy triggering the violation must be tethered to a constitutional or statutory provision citation or a regulation carrying out statutory policy.id.at,d.the court further stated,a n undefined standard of what is unfair fails to give businesses adequate guidelines as to what conduct may be challenged and thus enjoined and may sanction arbitrary or unpredictable decisions about what is fair or unfair.in some cases,it may even lead to the enjoining of pro competitive conduct and thereby undermine consumer protection,the primary purpose of the antitrust laws accordingly,we believe we must devise a more precise test for determining what is unfair under the unfair competition law.ibid.
the court held,to guide courts and the business community adequately and to promote consumer protection,we must require that any finding of unfairness to competitors under business and professions code section be tethered to some legislatively declared policy or proof of some actual or threatened impact on competition.we thus adopt the following test when a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a direct competitor unfair act or practice invokes section,the word unfair in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law,or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law,or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition,supra,cal th at,d.
in a footnote,the court added,t his case involves an action by a competitor alleging anticompetitive practices.our discussion and this test are limited to that context.nothing we say relates to actions by consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair competition law such as fraudulent or unlawful business practices or unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
following the california supreme court decision in,supra,cal th,d,appellate court opinions have been divided over whether the definition of unfair under the ucl as stated in should apply to ucl actions brought by consumers.compare,smith,supra,th at,fn,d we are not to read as suggesting that such a restrictive definition of unfair should be applied in the case of an alleged consumer injury with scripps,supra,th at,d applying to consumer ucl action requirement set forth in that a ucl claim be tethered to a legislatively declared policy.we do not need to decide whether smith or scripps applied the correct definition of unfair in ucl actions brought by consumers because,as discussed post,the second amended complaint failed to allege unfair conduct under both the smith and scripps lines of cases.
the second amended complaint did not allege unfair conduct under smith,supra,th.
in sustaining dcc demurrer,the trial court relied on the definition of unfair applied in smith,supra,th,d.citing footnote of,supra,cal th at page,d,in which the supreme court expressly limited its discussion in that case to ucl actions brought by competitors,the appellate court in smith held the definition of unfair should not be applied to ucl actions brought by consumers.smith,at,fn,d see also south bay chevrolet general motors acceptance th,fn,d supreme court criticism of definition of unfair in was expressly limited to the competitor context and specifically stated not to relate to actions by consumers people ex rel.bill lockyer fremont life ins.th,fn,d in,california supreme court developed a definition but expressly limited it to anticompetitive cases and excluded cases such as the one at bar involving injury to consumers gafcon,ponsor associates th,fn,d.agreeing with smith that the definition of unfair should not be applied to consumer cases,the appellate court in progressive west insurance superior court th,d,stated,we believe business and professions code section unfair prong should be read more broadly in consumer cases because consumers are more vulnerable to unfair business practices than businesses and without the necessary resources to protect themselves from sharp practices.one of the major purposes of section is to protect consumers from nefarious business practices.
in its amicus brief in this case,consumer attorneys of california argues definition of unfair only makes sense in the limited context of a ucl action brought by a competitor because the supreme court was so rigorous in expressly confining this new definition of unfair conduct to actions brought by direct competitors for activity,it would violate all the usual principles of case interpretation to extend that rule to other actions.consumer attorneys of california further argues,the supreme court in was very rigorous in limiting its discussion about what constitutes unfairness to the context of the case,conduct alleged by a competitor.tethering the definition of what constitutes unfair conduct in that context to the antitrust laws themselves obviously pushes the definition of unfair toward the unlawful end of the continuum it not actually unlawful,but it looks,smells and feels like the conduct is unlawful but to extend that limited definition of what constitutes unfair conduct to the general consumer interest is not only unwarranted,it essentially writes the unfair prong out of the statute.although there are a number of consumer protection laws to which the unfair prong could be tethered,there is just as much reason to expect that businesses that want to engage in sharp practices will find ways around those laws and will engage in conduct that is not even the general subject of any law.
citing the holding of people casa blanca convalescent homes,supra,d,the court in smith,supra,th at pages,d,stated,an unfair business practice occurs when that practice offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.the appellate court in smith also cited the holding of state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,th at pages,d,that t he test of whether a business practice is unfair involves an examination of that practice impact on its alleged victim,balanced against the reasons,justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer.in brief,the court must weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.smith,at,d see also pastoria nationwide,supra,th,d agreeing with smith that the test for unfairness under the ucl in a consumer context is weighing the impact of the act on the alleged victim against the reasons,justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer progressive west insurance superior court,supra,th at,d we conclude that the balancing test should continue to apply in consumer cases people ex rel.renne servantes th,d in determining whether business practice was unfair within meaning of ucl,court applied test whether the gravity of the harm to the victim outweighs the utility of the defendant conduct.
the smith court further stated,e xamples of unfair business practices include charging a higher than normal rate for copies of deposition transcripts by a group of certified shorthand reporters,where the party receiving the original is being given an undisclosed discount as the result of an exclusive contract with two insurance companies citation placing unlawful or unenforceable terms in form contracts citation asserting a contractual right one does not have citations systematically breaching a form contract affecting many consumers citation,or many producers citation and imposing contract terms that make the debtor pay the collection costs citation.smith,supra,th at,d.
in smith,supra,th,d,the plaintiffs filed a class action against several insurance companies which provided approximately percent of the automobile liability insurance sold in california for,inter alia,issuing separate policies for each insured multiple cars and refusing to permit any waiver of uninsured motorist coverage that did not include all of the insured vehicles.the court held,s uch conduct is at least generally alleged by plaintiffs and,it is also alleged,was done for the purpose of requiring insureds to purchase more uninsured motorist coverage than was needed,all to the alleged increased premium benefit of the defendant insurers and to the injury and damage of insureds who were faced with the choice of paying wasteful increased premiums or going without any uninsured motorist coverage.fn.omitted.we have no trouble concluding,given our review of the authorities discussed above,that such conduct,if proven,would constitute an unfair business practice actionable under the ucl.id.at,d.
here,the second amended complaint did not contain sufficient allegations to satisfy the definition of unfair set forth in smith,supra,th at pages,d.the second amended complaint alleged an impact on plaintiffs in the form of the cost for the repair or replacement of the tubular steel exhaust manifold after an indeterminate number of miles.the second amended complaint alleged dcc use of the less durable tubular steel exhaust manifolds was to earn excessive profits by selling replacement parts and to gain an unfair advantage over dcc competitors by reducing the cost of goods sold,increasing profits and gaining market share.
does the use of less expensive and less durable materials in the manufacture of dcc vehicles to make more money violate public policy no.the second amended complaint did not allege dcc made any representations regarding the composition of the exhaust manifolds.plaintiffs did not allege any personal injury or safety concerns related to dcc use of tubular steel exhaust manifolds.the second amended complaint did not allege dcc use of tubular steel exhaust manifolds violated any warranty or other agreement.
on appeal,plaintiffs have not cited any legal authority supporting the position that dcc use of the less expensive and less durable tubular steel exhaust manifolds violated public policy.our research has not revealed any authority which supports plaintiffs position.indeed,the california supreme court holding in seely white motor cal d,supports the opposite position.although in the context of a breach of warranty case,the supreme court in seely stated the general public policy that a consumer can be fairly charged with the risk that the product will not match his economic expectations unless the manufacturer agrees that it will.even in actions for negligence,a manufacturer liability is limited to damages for physical injuries and there is no recovery for economic loss alone.ibid.as discussed ante,there are no allegations dcc ever made any representations regarding the performance of the tubular steel exhaust manifolds,and plaintiffs did not seek any damages for physical injuries.
furthermore,we agree with the trial court that nothing about dcc use of tubular steel exhaust manifolds,as alleged by plaintiffs in the second amended complaint,supports the conclusion dcc conduct was immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.as stated in community assisting recovery,aegis security ins.th,d,in the context of applying the smith definition of unfair,w e recognize that unfair competition statutes have always been framed in broad,sweeping language,precisely to enable judicial tribunals to deal with the innumerable new schemes which the fertility of man invention would contrive.citation.citation.and we are mindful that what is unfair or fraudulent,unlike unlawfulness,is a question of fact,which involves an equitable weighing of all the circumstances,a process which usually precludes the court from sustaining a demurrer.citation.however,we will affirm a judgment of dismissal where the complaint fails to allege facts showing that a business practice is unfair,unlawful or fraudulent.here,plaintiffs failed to plead facts to show dcc engaged in an unfair business practice under smith 
the second amended complaint did not allege unfair conduct under scripps,supra,th.
in gregory,supra,th,d,the appellate court disagreed with the use of the definition of unfair in smith,stating,however,may signal a narrower interpretation of the prohibition of unfair acts or practices in all unfair competition actions and provides reason for caution in relying on the broad language in earlier decisions that the court found to be too amorphous.fn.omitted.moreover,where a claim of an unfair act or practice is predicated on public policy,we read to require that the public policy which is a predicate to the action must be tethered to specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions.see also schnall hertz,supra,th at,d holding that any claims of unfairness under the ucl should be defined in connection with a legislatively declared policy also applied to ucl actions brought by consumers textron financial national union fire ins.th,d in consumer ucl action,court stated,given the supreme court disapproval of state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,th,d amorphous definition of unfair practices and its focus on legislatively declared public policy,reliance on general common law principles to support a cause of action for unfair competition is unavailing churchill village,general electric d,fn.holding definition of unfair also applies to consumer ucl actions byars scme mortgage bankers,th,d court applied test in consumer ucl action,stating t o show a business practice is unfair,the plaintiff must show the conduct threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law,or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law,or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.
in scripps,supra,th,d,a decision by division one of the fourth appellate district,the appellate court agree d with the gregory,supra,th,d court,which found that narrowed the expansive earlier interpretations of the term unfair.in scripps,the plaintiffs received medical care from scripps clinic through their medical insurance with health net.scripps,at,d.after the plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice action against two physicians affiliated with scripps,scripps informed the plaintiffs that it was exercising its right under its contract with health net to have the plaintiffs transferred to another medical group.id.at,d.health net transferred the plaintiffs to university of california at san diego health network.id.at,d.the plaintiffs sued scripps and one of its employees,contending,inter alia,scripps violated the ucl.ibid.the trial court denied the motion for summary adjudication as to scripps,and scripps filed a petition for a writ of mandate.ibid.
the appellate court in scripps,supra,th,d,held the trial court erred by not granting summary adjudication of the unfair competition claim.the court stated,has left it unclear whether we still rely upon the earlier definitions of unfair,which it criticized.we agree with the gregory court,which found that narrowed the expansive earlier interpretations of the term unfair to require that the public policy which is a predicate to the action must be tethered to specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions.id.at,d.the plaintiffs argued scripps transfer policy was unfair because it impeded a patient right to sue for malpractice,in violation of his or her constitutional right to seek redress in the courts.ibid.the appellate court disagreed,stating,scripps does not interfere with the malpractice action it merely chooses not to treat the litigants once the decision to litigate has been communicated to scripps.ibid.the scripps court further stated,t he right upon which the plaintiffs actually rely is a patient right to continuity of care from a physician of her choosing.but there is no such right.the relationship is a contractual one.citations.as we discussed above,a physician can lawfully withdraw from treating a patient after notice and a reasonable time to secure another physician.ibid.
applying the definition of unfair set forth in scripps and related cases,we conclude the second amended complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to satisfy that definition as well.here,plaintiffs ucl claim is based on the allegations that dcc knowingly used tubular steel exhaust manifolds in the vehicles without affirmatively advising customers of that fact consequently,the exhaust manifolds of the vehicles required earlier repair or replacement than would have been the case had exhaust manifolds been used instead.the second amended complaint did not allege the ucl claim is tethered to any constitutional,statutory or regulatory provision.
as in scripps,the right upon which plaintiffs actually rely right to have a vehicle containing an exhaust manifold that lasts as long as an industry standard exhaust one based on a contract such as a warranty,not on a legislatively declared policy.no law generally requires a manufacturer to use the most expensive or most durable materials in the manufacture of its products.therefore,even if the trial court should have applied the scripps definition of unfair,the complaint failed to state a claim 
significant questions raised by and the subsequent conflicting lines of appellate court authority.
even though the allegations of facts of this case have made it unnecessary for us to decide which definition of unfair in the ucl applies in consumer actions,our discussion shows the widening divide among appellate courts regarding this issue.in summary,one line of cases relies heavily on the supreme court language in footnote of,supra,cal th at page,d,that n othing we say relates to actions by consumers italics added,while the other line strongly relies on the supreme court unqualified criticism in of the definitions of unfair as set forth in state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,th at page,d and people casa blanca convalescent homes,supra,d at page,both of which were ucl cases brought by consumers.
did the supreme court limit its holding in to ucl actions brought by competitors simply because the circumstance of a consumer ucl action was not before it,or because the definition of unfair should be different depending on whether the action is brought by a consumer or a competitor was the supreme court expressing the view that regulation of competitive conduct is contained in existing legislation,but there is
