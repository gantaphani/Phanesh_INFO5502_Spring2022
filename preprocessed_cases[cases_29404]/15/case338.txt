this banking case presents a preemption question.the texas legislature enacted a par value statute.bus,hereinafter par value which prohibits banks in texas,including national banks,from charging a fee for cashing a check that is presented to be drawn against an account that the bank itself holds.wells fargo bank of texas,et the banks are national banks that do business in texas the banks contend that par value is preempted by the national bank act,et,and by a.on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court found that par value is preempted,granted summary judgment in favor of the banks,permanently enjoined james,in his capacity as texas banking commissioner hereinafter texas or appellant,from enforcing par value,and decreed par value null and void.appellant appeals from this ruling.
texas enacted par value which provides that,a payor bank shall pay a check drawn on it against an account with a sufficient balance at par,without regard to whether the payee holds an account at the bank.texas bcc a.the legislation prohibits banks from charging a fee to holding payees who present a check to the bank which holds the account that the check is drawn against.under par value banks are still permitted to charge a fee for cashing a check to the account holder who authored the check.texas offers two policy considerations in support of par value.first,texas identifies par value as a consumer protection measure,enacted to ensure that texas employees,and in particular the working poor,receive payment for the face value of their paycheck.texas notes that individuals who do not have a checking account and who seek to cash checks at the institution which issued the negotiable instrument are predominately individuals,and are also disproportionately members of minorities.texas sought to prohibit banks from exporting the cost of issuing a negotiable instrument to its account service that is clearly useless unless the instrument is holding payees with whom the bank has no financial relationship.additionally,texas sought to protect the integrity of negotiable instruments in texas,concluding that if a check is subject to a redemption fee,the value of the check itself differs from its face value.par value was scheduled to go into effect september.
appellee banks are organized under the national bank act nba,et and they conduct business in texas.the nba authorizes federally chartered national banks to,exercise all such incidental powers to carry on the business of banking by discounting and negotiating promissory notes,drafts,bills of exchange and other evidences of debt.seventh.
the office of the comptroller of the currency occ is the agency empowered by the nba to supervise and regulate federally chartered banks in accordance with the broad substantive provisions of the nba.in an exercise of this authority the occ promulgated a,which provides that a national bank may,charge its customers charges and fees.the occ interprets the word customer in the regulation to include any person who presents a check for payment in august,the occ issued identical letters to three of the appellee banks opining that the banks were authorized under a to charge a fee to holders.the letter expressly declined to opine as to whether par value was preempted by a and the nba.
on august,appellees initiated this action under a preemption theory.the banks sought a permanent injunction and a declaration that par value was null and void.on august,the district court entered a preliminary injunction followed by a permanent injunction on december.the district court found par value was preempted by the nba and interpretive rule a,declared par value null and void.appellant appeals the district court determination that par value is preempted.
the principal question before this court is whether the texas par value statute stands in irreconcilable conflict with,and is consequently preempted by,federal law we conclude that it is.
in assessing whether par value is preempted,our paramount concern is to effectuate the intent of congress.california fed.sav.loan ass guerra,d.generally we have recognized three ways in which congress evidences its intent to preempt state law.id.at.city of morgan city south louisiana,cir.congress may reveal its preemptive intention by enacting express language to that effect,or by occupying the regulatory field,or,as here,by enacting a law which the state legislation irreconcilably conflicts id.in this third instance,which is the situation at hand,the intent to preempt contrary state law is ascribed to congress,presuming as we do,that congress intended to supercede those subsequent state regulations that conflict with the letter or frustrate the purpose of the federal regulatory scheme.
in the field of banking regulation,our conflict preemption analysis is further refined by the supreme court holding in barnett bank of marion county,nelson,d.in barnett bank,the supreme court found that a florida law which forbade banks in florida from selling insurance was preempted by a federal statute that expressly authorized national banks to sell insurance.id.at.the barnett bank court concluded that a state statute may regulate national banks,where doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank exercise of its powers.id.at.thus,where a state statute interferes with a power which national banks are authorized to exercise,the state statute irreconcilably conflicts with the federal statute and is preempted by operation of the supremacy clause,art.vi,cl.barnett bank,d.
therefore,in the case at bar,to determine whether par value stands in conflict with federal law,we must first determine whether federal law authorizes the which par value prohibits.the banks assert that par value is preempted by the occ promulgated regulation a we turn now to consider the preemptive effect of that provision.
section a provides that a national bank may charge its customers charges and fees,including deposit account service charges.a.while on its face,the regulation would seem not to conflict with par value,as par value prohibits a fee charged to holding payee,the occ has interpreted the word customer in the regulation to mean anyone who presents a check for payment.the banks therefore deduce that given the occ construction of customer,a authorizes the banks to charge the same fee which par value prohibits 
appellant raises two challenges to the putatively preemptive effect of a.appellant asserts that congress did not intend for the occ to exercise its discretion in a manner which would preempt par value.appellant further maintains that the district court erred in deferring to the occ construction of a.we disagree on both counts.
congressional intent 
appellant asserts that the occ interpretation of the nba which would allow national banks in texas to charge fees for cashing checks is contrary to congressional intent.it is well settled that where congress has spoken unambiguously as to the precise question at hand,the court must give effect to congress intent regardless of whether the agency entrusted to regulate the congressional mandate has adopted an alternate interpretation.chevron usa,natural resources defense council,d.
appellant,however,does not argue that congress has spoken unambiguously as to the precise question at is,whether the national banks are empowered to charge holding payees a fee.instead appellant argues that congress has not indicated an intention that the nba should supplant state laws of general application in this,though,appellant evidences a misapprehension of the focus of our intent inquiry here.at this stage of the preemption analysis we are concerned with whether congress intended to delegate to the occ the authority to authorize the holding payee fee,not with whether congress intended that state law would be preempted.as the supreme court has cautioned,where state law is claimed to be by federal regulation,a narrow focus on congress intent to supersede state law is misdirected instead the correct focus is on the federal agency that seeks to displace state law and on the proper bounds of its lawful authority to undertake such action.city of new y
