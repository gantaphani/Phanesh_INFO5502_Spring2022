given that the plaintiffs have settled and released all of their claims against the defendants,this case is moot.therefore,this appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because there is no justiciable case or controversy under article iii of the constitution.
plaintiffs calvin and nikki pettrey originally filed this lawsuit on may,against defendants enterprise title agency,first usa title agency,lp,and john desantis.in their complaint,the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had engaged in a fraudulent scheme whereby enterprise title agency essentially charged customers for services that were not performed and then used that money to give kickbacks to real estate agents who referred business to enterprise.on the basis of these allegations,the plaintiffs asserted the following claims violation of the real estate settlement procedures act,negligent misrepresentation under ohio law violation of the ohio consumer sales practices act and civil conspiracy under ohio law.the plaintiffs complaint also sought damages and attorneys fees and costs.
after initiating the case,the plaintiffs conducted discovery pertaining to the issue of class certification.on may,they filed a motion to certify the case as a class action.record on appeal roa at.the district court denied this motion on december.id.at.the plaintiffs then filed a motion for reconsideration,id.at,but the district court denied that motion as well,id.at,and then granted the defendants motion to strike the class action allegations in the complaint,id.the plaintiffs next sought interlocutory review of the district court decision to deny class certification,but the sixth circuit denied interlocutory review on june.id.at.thereafter,the plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement and released all of their individual claims for damages,attorneys fees,and costs against the defendants.the plaintiffs specifically did not settle their right to appeal the denial of class certification,their claims for attorneys fees and costs attributable to class claims,and their right to seek injunctive relief on behalf of the class.pursuant to the settlement agreement,the defendants paid the plaintiffs the sum of in damages and in costs and fees.the latter figure represented the full amount of costs and fees that the plaintiffs had incurred in pursuing both individual and class claims.

the problem here is that this case is no longer within the jurisdiction given to federal courts under article iii of the united states constitution.article iii conditions the exercise of federal judicial power on the existence of a live,ongoing case or controversy.see lewis cont l bank,d citing deakins monaghan,d preiser newkirk,d.if a case in federal court loses its character as an actual,live controversy at any point during its pendency,it is said to be moot.see demis sniezek,cir.when that happens,the case is no longer within the jurisdiction of the federal courts,and therefore must be dismissed.see id.such is the case here.
simply stated,a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.uaw dana,cir quoting powell mccormack,d.generally speaking,s ettlement of a plaintiff claims moots an action.brunet city of columbus,cir quoting lusardi xerox,cir see also dana,at generally,the settlement of a dispute between the parties does render the case moot.citing local,oil,chemical atomic workers int l union missouri,d itt rayonier united states,cir.this is true here because once the plaintiffs had settled and released all of their claims against the defendants,the plaintiffs no longer had a personal,a legally cognizable the outcome of the litigation.in other words,this case is moot because there is nothing left for the plaintiffs to win 
it is true that in two previous cases,the supreme court has allowed named plaintiffs to appeal denials of class certification even after the named plaintiffs individual claims had become moot.these cases,however,are distinguishable from the case at hand,and therefore inapplicable.first,in deposit guaranty national bank roper,d,a group of plaintiffs sued the defendant bank for charging interest in excess of the rate allowed under the national bank act,see id.at.after the plaintiffs motion for class certification was denied,the bank tendered to each plaintiff the maximum amount that they could have received under the statute.see id.at.the plaintiffs objected to this tender because they desired to appeal the denial of class certification.see id.over the plaintiffs objections,the district court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in the amounts tendered by the bank and then dismissed the action.see id.at.the court of appeals reversed,finding that the case was not moot and that class certification should have been granted.see id.at.the supreme court then granted certiorari for the purpose of determining whether the case was moot.the court implicitly held that the dispute over class certification was a live controversy,see id.at,and it explicitly held that the plaintiffs retained a personal stake in the issue of class certification despite the fact that they had prevailed on the merits of their individual claims,see id.at.specifically,the court found that the plaintiffs retained a personal stake in the case because they would be able to shift part of the costs of litigation to the class members if they prevailed in their attempt at class certification.see id.at.
similarly,in united states parole commission geraghty,d,the court allowed a named plaintiff to appeal the denial of class certification even though the named plaintiff individual claims had become moot.in geraghty,the named plaintiff sought to challenge the constitutionality of the united states parole commission parole release guidelines.at the time the case was filed,the named plaintiff was a federal prisoner.he filed the case on behalf of himself and the class of all federal prisoners who are or will become eligible for release on parole,id.at,but the district court denied class certification and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,id.at.while the case was pending on appeal,the named plaintiff was mandatorily released from prison,thereby rendering the parole release guidelines inapplicable to him.id.at.nevertheless,the supreme court concluded that the case was not moot.in particular,it held that there was still a live controversy as to the class certification issue because the parole release guidelines still applied to some of the members of the class that the named plaintiff sought to represent.see id.at.as evidence of the live nature of the controversy,the court noted that some of the putative class members had moved to be substituted as the named plaintiff.id.finally,with regard to the second aspect of,the personal stake court found that the named plaintiff personal stake in the outcome of the litigation was,in a practical sense,no different from that of the putative class representatives in roper.id.at.
the case at hand is distinguishable from both roper and geraghty.first,it is doubtful that there is a live controversy here because the named plaintiffs claims were voluntarily relinquished,whereas they were involuntarily terminated in both roper and geraghty.indeed,the geraghty court recognized the distinction between a voluntary relinquishment of claims and an involuntary termination of claims when it expressly declined to express a view as to whether a named plaintiff who settles the individual claim after denial of class certification may,consistent with art.iii,appeal from the adverse ruling on class certification.geraghty,at.citing united airlines,mcdonald,d additionally,unlike in geraghty,no members of the putative class have come forward in an attempt to preserve the live nature of this controversy by being substituted as the named plaintiff.
most importantly though,this case is distinguishable from roper and geraghty because the named plaintiff
