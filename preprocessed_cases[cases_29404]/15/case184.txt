opinion of the court 
this is an interlocutory appeal under.f.plaintiff hayes brought a putative class action against wal mart,asserting claims for violation of the new jersey consumer fraud act,breach of contract,and unjust enrichment in connection with wal mart sale of extended warranty plans through sam club retail stores.defendant wal mart contests the trial court order granting plaintiff hayes motion for class certification.post certification,we decided marcus bmw of north america,llc,cir,which thoroughly explored rule class definition,ascertainability,and numerosity requirements.because those requirements are key issues in this appeal,we will vacate the certification order and remand in light of marcus.
sam club is a retail warehouse owned and operated by wal mart.each of sam club stores has a section for certain clearance items,called items.items may be designated for the section for a variety of reasons.they may be display items,which were removed from their packaging to show to members items that were purchased and then returned items that are but that sam club wants to clear out,called last one items or items that were damaged.each item in the section is marked with an orange sticker that states the product is being sold.
when a person desires to purchase an item,a sam club cashier at the point of sale scans the item.the original price appears on the point of sale system,and the cashier must perform a price override by manually entering the discounted price.sam club software records the fact that a price override was performed,but does not include the reason for the override.significantly,price overrides can be made for reasons other than the fact that an item was designated,including when a member requests a discount because the item is sold for less elsewhere,or when a member purchases an item and later finds it on sale.separately,each of the sam club stores keeps a handwritten log of items that are marked and the reason for doing so.it is notable that the log does not track the sale of those items.
sam club contracted with national electronics warranty corporation new to sell extended warranty products called service plans for various items sold in the store.the service plans state new will not cover products sold including but not limited to floor models unless covered by a full manufacturer warranty on your date of purchase and demonstration models.as indicated,service plans will cover items that still have their manufacturers warranties,including last one items that are sealed and,as well as some display items 
plaintiff hayes made two separate purchases of items.on each occasion,a sam club employee offered and hayes agreed to purchase a service plan for the item.at the time of his purchases,hayes contends he was not told whether the service plan would actually cover his item.on august,hayes purchased an power washer for along with a service plan that cost.there is no evidence that hayes was offered a refund for the service plan or that he had problems with the product and sought to have it serviced.on july,hayes purchased an television set for along with a service plan that cost.after taking the television set home and discovering it was missing certain pieces,he returned to the store.the store eventually provided hayes with a manual and remote.a store employee also informed him that sam club should not have sold him the service plan because it did not cover the television and offered to refund him the cost of the service plan.hayes declined.
on january,hayes filed suit on behalf of himself and all other persons who purchased a service plan for an product from sam clubs in new jersey since january.he asserted a violation of the new jersey consumer fraud act,breach of contract,and unjust enrichment.the trial court certified the following rule b class 
all consumers who,from january,to the present,purchased from sam clubs in the state of new jersey,a sam club service plan to cover products.excluded from the class are consumers whose product was covered by a full manufacturer warranty,was a item,consumers who obtained service on their product,and consumers who have previously been reimbursed for the cost of the service plan.
the trial court found the class,under this amended definition,fulfilled the requirements of.specifically,the court found the class was ascertainable because members could be determined with reference to objective criteria.the court found the class was sufficiently numerous because sam club had records of member transactions during the class period that included both a price override and the purchase of a service plan the court reasoned that if even of those price overrides were for items that were ineligible for service plan protection,the class would be sufficiently numerous.the court found that common issues predominated over individualized issues because the essential elements of each claim were susceptible to common proof.in addition,the court found hayes purchase of a service plan for the power washer was a proper basis for class certification but not his purchase of a service plan for the television set,since the service plan for the television set was honored when sam club replaced the missing remote.we granted wal mart interlocutory appeal under.f.
class certification is proper only if the trial court is satisfied,after a rigorous analysis,that the prerequisites of rule a have been satisfied.frequently that rigorous analysis will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim.that can not be helped.wal mart stores,dukes,citations omitted quoting.of sw.falcon.factual determinations supporting rule findings must be made by a preponderance of the evidence,in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,cir,and the burden of proof rests on the movant,id.at.a party assurance to the court that it intends or plans to meet the requirements is insufficient.id.at.

wal mart asserts the trial court erred in failing to consider whether it is administratively feasible to ascertain the class.wal mart argues the trial court will have to engage in impractical to determine if putative class members fall within the class definition.
it is plaintiff burden to show that a class action is a proper vehicle for this lawsuit.see comcast behrend,the class action is an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.to come within the exception,a party seeking to maintain a class action must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with rule.citations and quotation marks omitted.as an essential prerequisite to class certification,marcus,at,plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the class is ascertainable.see in re hydrogen peroxide,at factual determinations necessary to make rule findings must be made by a preponderance of the evidence.in marcus,we explained that ascertainability is important because it eliminates serious administrative burdens by insisting on the easy identification of class members allows for the best notice practicable,and thereby protects absent class members and protects defendants by clearly identifying the individuals to be bound by the final judgment.at quotation marks omitted.

if marcus attempts to certify a class on remand,the district court adjusting the class definition as needed must resolve the critical issue of whether the defendants records can ascertain class members and,if not,whether there is a reliable,administratively feasible alternative.we caution,however,against approving a method that would amount to no more than ascertaining by potential class members say so.for example,simply having potential class members submit affidavits that their bridgestone rfts have gone flat and been replaced may not be proper or just.forcing bmw and bridgestone to accept as true absent persons declarations that they are members of the class,without further indicia of reliability,would have serious due process implications.

because the able trial court here did not have the benefit of marcus guidance,it did not consider whether it would be administratively feasible to ascertain class members.in discussing numerosity,however,the court noted that sam club had no method for determining how many of the transactions that took place during the class period were for items.the court did not see this as a barrier to class certification,reasoning that plaintiff should not be hindered from bringing a class action because defendant lacked certain records.
but the nature or thoroughness of a defendant recordkeeping does not alter the plaintiff burden to fulfill rule requirements.nor has plaintiff cited any statutory or regulatory authority obligating wal mart to create and maintain a particular set of records.in re hydrogen peroxide,at explaining that even a district court broad discretion to control proceedings does not soften the rule a class may not be certified without a finding that each rule requirement is met.rule requirements that the class be administratively feasible to ascertain and sufficiently numerous to warrant class action treatment can not be relaxed or adjusted on the basis of hayes assertion that wal mart records are of no help to him.
given the trial court finding that wal mart lacks records that are necessary to ascertain the class,to be successful on remand,plaintiff must offer some reliable and administratively feasible alternative that would permit the court to determine whether a sam club member purchased a service plan for an item,whether the item was a last one item or otherwise came with a full manufacturer warranty,and whether the member nonetheless received service on the item or a refund of the cost of the service plan id.at explaining that,in class action litigation,a critical need is to determine how the case will be tried quoting.advisory committee note,amendments.based on the existing record,plaintiff has not fulfilled this burden.but we will nonetheless remand because plaintiff did not have the benefit of our decision in marcus when he submitted evidence of the class ascertainability.
to summarize,plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a reliable and administratively feasible method for ascertaining the class.see marcus,at in re hydrogen peroxide,at.this petition for class certification will founder if the only proof of class membership is the of putative class members or if ascertaining the class requires extensive and individualized.
the trial court found the class was sufficiently numerous to warrant class action treatment.it reasoned that since sam club has data showing approximately price override transactions for which a service plan was also purchased,if even of those price overrides were for items ineligible for service plan protection,the class would be sufficiently numerous under.a.walmart argues there was no factual basis to infer the number of class members and that the court engaged in impermissible speculation to find the proposed class fulfilled the numerosity requirement.in fact,wal mart asserts plaintiff failed to prove that even a single person meets the class definition 
under rule a,the class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.this requirement assures that class action treatment is necessary.baby neal casey,cir.moreover,a party seeking class certification must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties dukes.at.mere speculation as to the number of class members even if such speculation is a bet worth making can not support a finding of numerosity.marcus,at.
the district court in marcus engaged in an inquiry similar to that by the court in the present case.the plaintiff in marcus submitted of nationwide complaints from purchasers and lessees regarding bmws with rfts of any brand,but did not specify whether,as the class definition required,the complainants purchased or leased their cars in new jersey nor how many of the complainants had rfts.id.at.despite the dearth of geographic and evidence,the district court found that the new jersey class met the numerosity requirement because it is common sense that there will be more members of the class than the number of consumers who complained probably significantly more,and common sense indicates that there will be at least.id.at quoting marcus bmw of,llc,wl,at.
we held the district court abused its discretion,stating 
mere speculation is insufficient.of course,rule a does not require a plaintiff to offer direct evidence of the exact number and identities of the class members.but in the absence of direct evidence,a plaintiff must show sufficient circumstantial evidence specific to the products,problems,parties,and geographic areas actually covered by the class definition to allow a district court to make a factual finding.only then may the court rely on common sense to forgo precise calculations and exact numbers.
given the complete lack of evidence specific to bmws purchased or leased in new jersey with bridgestone rfts that have gone flat and been replaced,the district court numerosity ruling crossed the line separating inference and speculation.
id.at citations omitted.
here,plaintiff did not fulfill his burden of supplying circumstantial evidence specific to the products and problems involved the litigation and instead premised his argument for numerosity on improper speculation.the only concrete numerical evidence presented to the court was that new jersey sam clubs had on record transactions that included both a and the sale of a service plan.but there is no factual basis for determining how many of these transactions included the purchase of a service plan for an item that was not a last one item and that did not have a valid manufacturer warranty the specific product involved in this litigation.nor was there evidence of how many of these transactions involved service plans that were not ultimately honored,either by service or refund the specific problem involved in this litigation.in short,the only conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence presented to the trial court is that the number of class members would be and zero within that range,we can only speculate as to the number of class members.
and contrary to plaintiff assertion,it was not defendant burden to show how many of the transactions occurred for a reason other than the purchase of an item.it was plaintiff burden to demonstrate numerosity by a preponderance of the evidence.since plaintiff did not fulfill this burden,there was no basis to infer that the class is sufficiently numerous to qualify for class action treatment.
speaking more generally,where a putative class is some subset of a larger pool,the trial court may not infer numerosity from the number in the larger pool alone.accord vega t mobile usa,inc,cir finding the district court engaged in impermissible speculation where it inferred numerosity for a class without the aid of a shred of evidence,but only evidence on a national scale.the trial court must engage in a rigorous analysis,dukes.at quoting falcon,at,and find each of rule a requirements met by a preponderance of the evidence,in re hydrogen peroxide,at,before granting certification.
similarly,the trial court can not take a approach to numerosity or any other requirement of rule.certification may not be granted because the plaintiff promises the class will be able to fulfill rule requirements,with the caveat that the class can always be decertified if it later proves wanting.to certify a class in this manner is effectively to certify the class conditionally,which rule does not permit.see.advisory committee note,amendments a court that is not satisfied that the requirements of rule have been met should refuse certification until they have been met.in re hydrogen peroxide,at explaining the amendments to rule made clear that class certification may not be granted on a tentative basis.the trial court must make a definitive determination that the requirements of rule have been met before certifying a class.in re hydrogen peroxide,at.
the evidence presented in the trial court was insufficient to support a finding of numerosity.on remand,plaintiff must show either direct or circumstantial evidence specific to the problems and products involved in the litigation so the trial court may determine whether there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties to warrant class action treatment.without such evidence,plaintiff can not prove numerosity by a preponderance of the evidence.
wal mart reprises its ascertainability concerns under the predominance framework,contending common issues do not predominate over the individual inquiries necessary for determining which of the transactions involved the sale of items,whether the were last one items or otherwise came with manufacturers warranties,and whether members who purchased service plans for ineligible items nonetheless received service or refunds.
we have previously noted that the line dividing ascertainability from predominance is blurry.see marcus,at a scertainability problems spill into the predominance inquiry.but despite some overlap,they remain separate prerequisites to class certification and serve distinct purposes the ascertainability requirement focuses on whether individuals fitting the class definition may be identified without resort to,id.at,whereas the predominance requirement focuses on whether essential elements of the class claims can be proven at trial with common,as opposed to individualized,evidence,in re hydrogen peroxide,at.
the individual inquiries that wal mart has cited all focus on whether putative class members fit the class definition.thus,we think wal mart objection to certification on the basis of these inquiries is better analyzed under the ascertainability framework than the predominance framework.and as stated above,we agree with wal mart that on remand the trial court must consider whether there is a reliable and administratively feasible approach for resolving the necessary inquiries.
moreover,since ascertaining the class is logically antecedent to determining whether issues common to the class predominate over individual issues,we do not reach the question of whether hayes could satisfy rule b predominance a requirement even more demanding than rule a and designed for situations in which treatment is not as clearly called for.comcast.at some quotation marks omitted quoting dukes.at see also sullivan db,cir parallel with rule a commonality element,rule b predominance requirement imposes a more rigorous obligation upon a reviewing court to ensure that issues common to the class predominate over those affecting only individual class members.
on remand,should the trial court determine that hayes has satisfied the requirements of rule a,it should reevaluate whether the putative class satisfies the predominance requirement 
in its brief,wal mart draws our attention to hayes statement in deposition that he does not know if either the power washer or television set he purchased from sam club came with a manufacturer warranty.notably,the trial court excluded from the class definition any consumer who purchased a service plan for an product that was covered by a full manufacturer warranty at the date of purchase.the court reasoned that any such product would be insured under the terms of the service plan.
it is axiomatic that the lead plaintiff must fit the class definition.see,bailey patterson,plaintiffs can not represent a class of whom they are not a part.although different courts have asserted different origins for this axiom they arrive at the same conclusion where the lead plaintiff does not fit the class definition,the class may not be certified.wal mart does not contend we should consider hayes admission under any particular framework.in fact,wal mart highlights hayes admission in the context of numerosity contending hayes has failed to show that even one class member exists.but in addition to bolstering wal mart numerosity argument,we think hayes admission draws into question his standing to sue.see schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,to have standing to sue as a class representative it is essential that a plaintiff must be a part of that class,that is,he must possess the same interest and suffer the same injury shared by all members of the class he represents.
the court of appeals for the second circuit has explained that 
s tanding has both constitutional dimensions rooted in article iii case or controversy clause and prudential dimensions that are closely related to art.iii concerns but are essentially matters of judicial.the rule that a class representative must be part of the class is one of prudential standing,related to the broader principle that the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.
cordes.fin,edwards sons,cir second alteration in original citations,footnote,and quotation marks omitted.but where the plaintiff ability to fall within the class definition not only depends upon whether the plaintiff sustained the same injury as the class,but also upon whether the plaintiff sustained any injury at all,we find the issue of the plaintiff constitutional standing also invoked 
to have constitutional standing,a plaintiff must always have suffered a distinct and palpable injury to himself that is likely to be redressed if the requested relief is granted.gladstone realtors vill.of bellwo
