introduction 
washington usury statute prohibits ordinary lenders from making loans bearing interest rates in excess of.code.however,washington consumer loan act cla permits licensed lenders to charge interest rates up to to borrowers with less than perfect credit.code.washington also limits by statute the amount of origination fees a lender may charge.code.
in the market,the identity of the actual lender is not always clear.this case deals with whether old usury laws have caught up with modern practices in lending,intermediating,discounting,and sales.
put another way,have the brokers and lenders involved here structured their transactions so clearly that there remain no triable issues of fact whether unlicensed lenders made the loans as discussed below,we conclude that in certain instances they have,in others they have not.however,we also conclude that on some claims in which such triable issues remain,the borrowers claims are by the applicable statutes of limitation.accordingly,we will affirm in part and will reverse in part the orders of the district court,and will remand for further proceedings.
ii.factual and procedural background 
borrowers obtained residential second mortgage loans at interest rates greater than from union financial company union or american mortgage professionals,amp.after borrowers executed the loan documents,union assigned the loans to empire funding corporation empire and tms mortgage,the money store tms amp assigned the loans to firstplus financial,firstplus.empire,tms,and firstplus later sold the loans to various investment trusts collectively,trust defendants which pooled the loans together,securitized the loans into trusts,and sold interests in the trusts to investors.
zacher union financial company.no,and stone american mortgage professionals.no,are the two lead cases in a group of putative class actions with similar allegations that were originally filed in king county superior court,washington.borrowers complaints both allege that defendants violated washington state usury and consumer protection laws.invoking diversity jurisdiction,defendants in each action removed all putative class actions to federal court.the district court consolidated the actions,designated the lead actions,and stayed the others.
claims against union and amp 
the complaints allege causes of action for statutory usury violations of washington consumer protection act cpa negligence and common law usury.borrowers contend that their loans were usurious because union and amp were not licensed by the state of washington to charge interest in excess of.they further allege that,as assignees of the loans,tms and the trust defendants are subject to all claims and defenses that borrowers may assert against union and amp.
defendants contend that,as loan brokers,union and amp did not need licenses under the cla because they were not lending their own money.they contend that in each of the loans at issue,union and amp acted only as brokers because each loan was by empire,tms,or firstplus,each of whom was licensed under the cla to charge interest rates up to.
is defined as a settlement at which a loan is funded by a contemporaneous advance of loan funds and an assignment of the loan to the person advancing the funds.see,in a loan,the originator closes the loan in its own name,but is acting as an intermediary for the true lender,which assumes the financial risk of the transaction.the timing of the assignment is therefore sometimes pivotal in determining whether a residential mortgage loan is because the determinative question is who bears the risk of the transaction.
on august,the district court granted tms motion for summary judgment in zacher.in its order,the court conclude d that plaintiffs have not established a prima facie case of usury or negligence under washington state law.
reviewing washington statutes and case law,the court held that a loan broker may close a loan in its own name at an interest rate greater than,so long as the loan is and the party that provides the money for the loan is licensed under the cla.the court found that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the loans in the zacher case were and granted summary judgment on all claims.
on august,the district court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of amp against all plaintiffs except paula scott in stone.the district court held the exception of scott was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether any of borrowers loans had been.the district court denied amp motion for summary judgment on scott claims,finding an issue of fact as to whether her loan was 
claims against trust defendants 
borrowers also contend that,as successor holders of the allegedly usurious loans,the trust defendants are jointly and severally liable for the state law violations of union and amp.they do not allege that the trust defendants have any direct liability for their actions with respect of the origination of the loans it is clear that the trust defendants played no part in such loan originations.
the trust defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss or for summary judgment contending that borrowers lacked standing to sue any trust defendant who had not held a named plaintiff loan,the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over the trust defendants,the applicable statutes of limitation barred borrowers claims,and washington economic loss rule barred borrowers negligence claims.
on august,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of all trust defendants,holding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over each trust defendant.the district court concluded that the trust defendants had insufficient contacts with washington and that borrowers lacked standing to sue any trust defendant which had not held a named plaintiff loan.
on december,the district court entered an order certifying for immediate appeal under federal rule of civil procedure b its three orders granting summary judgment the august,order in zacher the august,order in stone granting summary judgment in favor of amp on the claims of all plaintiffs except scott and the august,order granting summary judgment in favor of all trust defendants.we have jurisdiction under to review these final orders of the district court.

iv.discussion 
summary judgment in favor of loan originating defendants 
the primary issue with respect to the loans in these cases is whether union and amp were lenders or were simply acting as brokers for tms,empire,and firstplus.a lender is one who puts money at risk.the touchstone for decision here is whether licensed or unlicensed parties were placing their own money at risk at any time during the transactions.the distinction is crucial because union and amp were not licensed under the washington cla at the time of the transactions at issue.if they were lenders,with their own money at risk of borrowers default,then their loans would be in violation of the usury statute.however,if they were acting merely as brokers,placing only their licensed principals money at risk,no such violation occurred.
in its august,order granting summary judgment in favor of union and tms,the district court relied on washington case law to apply a test to determine whether a loan originator who closes a loan in its own name is a broker or a lender.citing national bank of commerce of seattle thomsen,the district court found the following criteria to be determinative of a loan originator status as a broker,rather than a lender whether the originator had a relationship with the lender,such as a credit line whether the originator received funds from the lender before or after it dispersed them to the borrower and whether the borrower was apprized of the type of agreement into which he entered.we hold that the district court correctly interpreted washington law to conclude that a broker who a loan for the actual lender is not a lender in the transaction and need not be licensed under the cla licensing requirement.
washington courts look to the substance,not the form,of a transaction to determine whether it is usurious 
washington courts consistently look to the substance,not the form,of an allegedly usurious transaction.for example,in simpson cox,the washington supreme court affirmed a judgment in favor of the lender plaintiff and held that a note was not usurious where the defendants had agreed to repay at interest and grant the plaintiff a guaranteed profit of.the plaintiff had advanced to the defendants for a business venture and received in return a promissory note for principal plus the guaranteed profit payable at.the defendants contended that the should be included in the calculation of the interest,which would render the rate on the note greater than the maximum allowable rate of.
the trial court granted judgment for the plaintiff,holding that the transaction was a joint venture and the was a guaranteed profit,not hidden interest.in affirming,the washington supreme court stated 
since usury laws are,the courts will not hold a contract to be in violation of the usury laws unless upon a fair and reasonable construction of all of its terms,in view of the dealings of the parties,it is manifest that the intent of the parties was to engage in such a transaction as is forbidden by those laws in short the contract is not usurious when it may be explained on any other hypothesis.
id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
again,in clausing virginia lee homes,the washington supreme court examined the substance not the form of the transaction to find that the loan was usurious.there,the defendants had contracted for a residential mortgage loan and signed a promissory note in the amount of at interest.id.at.the plaintiff provided the defendants with a cash payment of after deducting expenditures.id.thereafter,the parties signed an agreement changing the repayment terms and a promissory note backdated to the date of the original note,but extending the repayment period.id.
after the defendants defaulted,the plaintiff sued on the note.id.at.the defendants contended the original note was usurious.id.the trial court entered judgment for the plaintiffs,but found the note usurious and calculated damages according to the principles set forth in the usury statute.id.
the washington supreme court affirmed,applying the principle that in cases involving alleged usury the law searches for the real transaction between the parties id.at.it found that the loan was actually for the amount of the cash payment and that the difference between the amount received and the face value of the note was hidden interest,which rendered the actual rate on the note in excess of.id.at.the superceding note with its extended repayment period was insufficient to purge the usury of the first note.id.at.
the district court derived the test noted above from national bank of commerce and mccall smith.in national bank of commerce,the plaintiff,national bank,sued to recover installment payments owed on a new car.defendant had purchased a new car with a down payment of approximately half the purchase price and agreed with the car dealer to pay a time price differential on the amount financed.he later refused to make further payments.bank of commerce,at.
plaintiff asserted that the credit sale was pursuant to a conditional sales contract,which was exempt from the usury statute.defendant asserted that the contract was usurious because the time price differential on the sale amounted to interest,in excess of the statutory maximum.id.the trial court held that the contract was an exempt conditional sales contract,not a loan.id.at.the washington supreme court reversed the trial court finding that the contract was actually a loan,and therefore subject to the usury statute.id.at.
the car dealer and national bank had a preexisting relationship,the contract stated that the obligation was to national bank,and the car dealer assigned the contract to national bank two days after thomsen executed it because thomsen executed the contract on a saturday,so the intervening day was a sunday.id.at.therefore,the court held that the contract was a loan from the bank,not a sale on credit by the car dealer.id.at.the party who furnished the money with which the purchase is made and to whom the purchaser obligates himself to repay that money is a lender.id.
in mccall,plaintiff sued to recover on a promissory note and foreclose on the real estate mortgage securing it.defendant asserted a usury defense.according to the washington supreme court,the principal question in dispute is whether the broker agreed to loan,and eventually did loan,its own money to appellants,or whether it acted as a broker for appellants in securing the loan from a third party.mccall,at.although the note at issue was in the name of the broker,the broker assigned it to the lender on the day it was executed and the borrower knew that it was for the account of the lender,not the broker.id.
the borrower contended that the broker was the lender and therefore the amount of the commission should be considered hidden interest.id.at.the washington supreme court affirmed the trial court determination that the note was not usurious because the broker had not acted as the lender.id.once the amount of the broker commission was deducted from the calculation of interest on the loan,the rate was not usurious.
washington usury law with respect to determining the identity of a lender shows that the party that provides the funds is the lender.where a broker who is not licensed under washington cla closes a loan in its own name,but the loan is actually funded by a licensed lender,the broker does not violate washington usury statute.
there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether some of these loans were.
although the district court properly interpreted washington state law,it erred in its application of the national bank of commerce test to the loans in question made to the zachers,the stones,and the browns.genuine issues of material fact remain with respect to the source of funding for the zachers loan,and with respect to whether the stones and the browns were apprised that their loans would be assigned or discounted,thereby effecting a transfer of the obligation to a creditor other than the originating broker.
loan transactions in zacher union financial 
the district court properly granted summary judgment on zoro claims.there is no dispute that tms and union had a relationship.union did not send zoro his checks until august,a day after it received money from tms on august.zoro received a letter dated the same day that he signed the promissory note which informed him that his loan was being assigned to tms.thus,all the elements of the test are met with respect to zoro loan,and summary judgment in favor of was proper.
however,there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether union used its own funds to deliver the money on the zachers loan before it received the transfer from empire.the district court therefore erred in granting summary judgment on the zachers claims.union paid the zachers loan with checks drawn on union account,dated september.union received a wire transfer from empire on september,two days after the checks to the borrowers were dated.there is no evidence in the record of when union actually delivered the checks to the zachers other than the checks themselves.
thus,the evidence is susceptible to the inference that union paid the zachers with union own money before union received the transfer from empire.summary judgment can not be granted where contrary inferences may be drawn from the evidence as to material issues.sherman oaks,at.
loan transactions in stone amp 
amp president presented undisputed deposition testimony that established amp had a preexisting relationship with firstplus.thus,this element of the district court test is met for all borrowers suing amp.similarly,the undisputed affidavit of amp president established that amp assigned each loan to firstplus shortly after its execution and contemporaneously with loan funding.the checks payable to the stones and the mayfields are dated after amp assigned their loans to firstplus.thus,there is no issue of fact as to whether amp used its own money it did not.
however,there is no evidence to show that either the stones or the browns were apprised that their loans would be assigned from amp to firstplus.thus,amp failed to establish this element of the test,and there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the stones and the browns were apprised of the assignment at the time that they executed their loan documents.the district court thus erred in granting summary judgment on their claims.
the district court correctly granted summary judgment on the mayfields claims.mayfield testified in deposition that he knew his loan was being assigned he did not object.thus all elements of the test are met and there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether amp the mayfields loan.
summary judgment in favor of trust defendants 
the district court erred in holding that the trust defendants are not subject to personal jurisdiction 
we begin a jurisdictional analysis by looking to the state statute authorizing its courts to exercise jurisdiction over out of state defendants.washington statute,section of the washington revised code,permits the exercise of jurisdiction to the full extent of the due process clause of the united states constitution.shute carnival cruise lines,rev on other grounds by carnival cruise lines,shute,d.under the due process analysis,a defendant may be subject to either general or specific personal jurisdiction.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.
general jurisdiction 
a defendant is subject to general jurisdiction only where the defendant contacts with a forum are substantial or continuous and systematic.bancroft masters,augusta,cir.the trust defendants submitted uncontroverted evidence that they have no offices,employees,or bank accounts in washington,do not conduct business in washington,and have not contracted with any washington resident.accordingly,the district court correctly found that the trust defendants are not subject to general personal jurisdiction in washington.
specific jurisdiction 
specific jurisdiction applies if the defendant has performed some act or consummated some transaction within the forum state or otherwise purposefully availed himself of the privileges of conducting activities in the forum,the claim arises out of or results from the defendant activities,and the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable.bancroft masters,at.
here,the trust defendants have availed themselves of the protections of washington law because they are beneficiaries of deeds of trust,which hypothecate washington realty to secure payments on notes owned by the trust defendants.the deeds of trust convey a property interest in washington realty,which interest the trust defendants expect washington law to protect.in sher johnson,cir,this court noted that holding a deed of trust represents a significant contact with the forum.the trust defendants also receive money from washington residents,albeit routed through the loan servicing companies who actually bill the payors.the trust defendants income stream is derived from loans negotiated and executed in washington and made to washington residents.
moreover,borrowers actions arise out of the trust defendants contacts with the forum because the suit is for recovery of the allegedly excessive interest payments borrowers made on their notes.defendants bear the burden of proving that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.bancroft masters,at.they have produced no evidence to show that exercise of jurisdiction over them would fail to comport with fair play and substantial justice.id.therefore,the district court erred in finding that it lacked specific personal jurisdiction over the trust defendants and we reverse the district court order on this ground.
the district court properly found that borrowers lack standing to sue some trust defendants 
borrowers can not establish traceability to trust defendants other than those who hold a named plaintiff note 
with respect to those trust defendant that do not hold a named plaintiff note,we affirm the district court ruling that plaintiffs have failed to link their causes of action with specific actions of the trust defendants and therefore lack standing to sue.constitutional standing requires a plaintiff to demonstrate an injury in fact traceability,a causal connection between the injury and the actions complained of and redressability.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
to satisfy the traceability requirement,a class action plaintiff must allege a distinct and palpable injury to himself,even if it is an injury shared by a large class of other possible litigants.warth seldin,d.here,no named plaintiff can trace the alleged injury in of usurious interest all of the trust defendants,but only to the trust defendant that holds or held that plaintiff note.as to those trusts which have never held a named plaintiff loan,borrowers can not allege a traceable injury and lack standing.
b.the district court properly considered standing before class issues 
the district court correctly addressed the issue of standing before it addressed the issue of class certification.borrowers contend that ortiz fibreboard,d requires courts to consider class certification before addressing standing issues.although the court in fibreboard examined class issues before the question of article iii standing,it did so in the very specific situation of a mandatory global settlement class.fibreboard does not require courts to consider class certification before standing.see id.at.noting that a court must be sure of its own jurisdiction before getting to the merits.
c.there is no juridical link to confer standing on borrowers 
relying on lamar h b novelty loan,cir,borrowers contend that the trust defendants are all juridically linked and therefore the named plaintiffs have standing to sue each trust defendant on behalf of the class.in lamar,the ninth circuit held that a plaintiff having a cause of action against one defendant could not represent a class with actions against defendants who had behaved similarly but had not injured the plaintiff.
the court based its ruling on the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure,holding that such a plaintiff could not satisfy the typicality or the fair and adequate representation elements of class certification.id.at.however,the court stated that a plaintiff might be able to satisfy the class requirements where all injuries are the result of a conspiracy or concerted schemes between the defendants or where all defendants are juridically related in a manner that suggests a single resolution of the dispute would be expeditious.id.at.
here,borrowers presented no evidence that their alleged injuries were the result of a conspiracy or concerted scheme between the trust defendants.to the contrary,the trust defendants are competitors for the purchase of secured loans in the same market place.nor are the trust defendants related governmental entities,the other situation contemplated by the la mar court.la mar,at noting that the facts before it did not concern a common rule applied by instrumentalities of a single state.the trust defendants are not juridically linked,and borrowers can not acquire standing to sue those defendants who do not now hold and have never held a named plaintiff loan through the juridical links doctrine.
borrowers remaining contentions regarding standing are without merit 
borrowers contend that the home owners equity protection act
