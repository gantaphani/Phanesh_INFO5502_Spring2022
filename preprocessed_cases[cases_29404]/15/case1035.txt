sarah jane schauer plaintiff appeals from a judgment of dismissal in favor of mandarin gems of california,dba black,starr frost defendant after the court sustained defendant demurrer to plaintiff second amended complaint without leave to amend.plaintiff sought to recover on various theories based on her discovery that a diamond ring given to her as an engagement gift prior to her marriage to her now former husband,darin erstad,allegedly was not worth the he paid defendant for it in.erstad is not a party to this action.
we reverse the judgment and remand.we conclude plaintiff has standing as a third party beneficiary of the sales contract between erstad and defendant,and she has adequately pleaded a contract cause of action based on allegations of defendant breach of express warranty.defendant must answer to that claim.in all other respects,the pleading is defective and can not be cured by amendment.
our factual summary accepts as true the facts alleged in the complaint,together with facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.barnett fireman fund ins.th,d.
plaintiff and erstad went shopping for an engagement ring on august.after looking at diamonds in premier jewelry establishments such as tiffany and company and cartier,they went to defendant store,where they found a ring that salesperson joy said featured a carat diamond with a clarity grading of.erstad bought the ring the same day for.the following month,for insurance purposes,defendant provided erstad a written appraisal verifying the ring had certain characteristics,including an clarity rating and an average replacement value of.paul lam,a graduate gemologist with the european gemological laboratory egl,signed the appraisal.
the couple subsequent short term marriage was dissolved in a north dakota judgment awarding each party,except as otherwise set forth in this agreement,the exclusive right,title and possession of all personal property which such party now owns,possesses,holds or hereafter acquires.plaintiff personal property included the engagement ring given to her by erstad.
on june,after the divorce,plaintiff had the ring evaluated by the gem trade laboratory,which gave the diamond a rating of quality,an appraisal with which multiple other unidentified jewelers,including one at defendant store agreed.that was how plaintiff discovered defendant alleged misrepresentation,concealment,and breach of express warranty regarding the true clarity of the diamond and its actual worth,which plaintiff information and less than what erstad paid for it.
plaintiff sued defendant on several theories.three times she attempted to plead her case.in the first cause of action of the second amended complaint,she sought to recover under the consumers legal remedies act the act,et,stating,inter alia,that had the true clarity of the diamond been known,plaintiff would not have acquired said diamond by causing it to be purchased for her.thereafter,if the written verification of the clarity value sent to erstad one month after the purchase had revealed the truth,plaintiff would have immediately rescinded the sale based on a failure of consideration.the second cause of action,for breach of contract,alleged erstad and defendant had a written contract under which erstad agreed to purchase the ring for the sole and stated purpose of giving it to plaintiff,making plaintiff a third party beneficiary of the sales contract.defendant breached the contract by delivering an engagement ring that did not conform to the promised clarity rating.
in her third cause of action,for constructive fraud,plaintiff claimed the existence of a special confidential relationship in which defendant was aware plaintiff and her predecessor in interest,presumably erstad,were not knowledgeable and were relying exclusively on the defendants integrity,but defendant falsely represented the clarity of the diamond with the intent to defraud p laintiff and her predecessor in interest to make the purchase at the inflated price.the fourth cause of action for fraud alleged defendant malicious and deceitful conduct warranted punitive damages.in the fifth cause of action,plaintiff sought rescission under civil code section for defendant alleged fraud in the inducement,mistake,and failure of consideration.
appended to the pleading was a redacted copy of a north dakota court judgment filed july,granting erstad and plaintiff a divorce pursuant to their stipulation and agreement,entitling each party,as noted ante,to the exclusive right,title and possession of all personal property of the parties,joint or several,which such party now owns,possesses,holds or hereafter acquires except as otherwise provided in the agreement,and awarding the parties their respective personal effects,clothing and jewelry.
in its general demurrer to the second amended complaint and each cause of action,defendant asserted plaintiff had no viable claim under any theory because plaintiff was neither the purchaser of the ring nor a third party beneficiary of the contract between defendant and erstad,who was not alleged to have assigned his rights to plaintiff the statute of limitations had expired for defendant alleged violations of the act plaintiff was not a buyer,and the ring tendered to erstad conformed entirely to the contract defendant owed no special confidential or fiduciary duty to plaintiff upon which to predicate a fraud cause of action any alleged fraud was the act of egl,not attributable to defendant and fraud was not pleaded with the required specificity 
the court again sustained the demurrer,this time without further leave to amend.the judgment of dismissal followed,and plaintiff appeals.as we will explain,the court erred.although the complaint is fatally defective in some respects,plaintiff is entitled as a matter of law to pursue her contract claim as a third party beneficiary.
discussion 
standard of review 
the trial court decision to sustain a demurrer is a legal ruling,subject to de novo review.lazar hertz th,d.w e give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.we reverse if the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any legal theory.citation.barnett fireman fund ins,supra,th at,d.
the issue before us is whether,on well pleaded facts,plaintiff may maintain an action to recover the difference between what erstad paid for the diamond ring and what that gift was really worth,given its alleged inferior quality.
we begin with the rule that e very action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,except as otherwise provided by statute.code civ.where the complaint shows the plaintiff does not possess the substantive right or standing to prosecute the action,it is vulnerable to a general demurrer on the ground that it fails to state a cause of action.carsten psychology examining com.cal d,cloud northrop grumman th,d.
the second amended complaint alleges d efendant entered into a written contract with erstad to purchase the subject engagement ring.the attached exhibit shows defendant issued a written appraisal to erstad.erstad is clearly a real party in interest,but he has not sued.
plaintiff contends she,too,is a real party in interest because the north dakota divorce judgment endowed her with all of erstad rights and remedies.as we will explain,this theory is wrong.however,as we will also discuss,plaintiff is correct in asserting she is a third party beneficiary of the sales contract.that status enables her to proceed solely on her contract claim for breach of express warranty.for the remainder,plaintiff is without standing to recover under any legal theory alleged,and the equitable remedy of rescission is also unavailable to her.
transfer of erstad rights and remedies to plaintiff 
plaintiff alleges and argues the north dakota divorce judgment granted her the exclusive right,title and possession of all of her personal property,including the engagement ring,and the judgment automatically divested erstad of his substantive rights and transferred or assigned them to her by operation of law.such is not the case.
plaintiff undoubtedly owns the ring.see,the ownership of property is absolute when a single person has the absolute dominion over it,and may use it or dispose of it according to his or her pleasure,subject only to general laws see also cent.code,the ownership of a thing shall mean the right of one or more persons to possess and use it to the exclusion of others.in this code the thing of which there may be ownership is called property.but ownership of gifted property,even if awarded in a divorce,does not automatically carry with it ownership of the rights of the person who bought the gift.as will be seen,contrary to plaintiff hypothesis,the divorce judgment did not give plaintiff the ring embellished with erstad rights under the contract or his choses in action.
a cause of action for damages is itself personal property.see,a thing in action is a right to recover money or other personal property by a judicial proceeding parker walker th,d a cause of action to recover money in damages is a chose in action and therefore a form of personal property see also iszler jorda,a chose in action is property.at the time of the divorce judgment,all causes of action that could have been asserted against the jeweler by a buyer of the ring were erstad personal property.he was,after all,the purchaser of the ring.the divorce agreement awarded to each party his or her respective personal property,except as otherwise expressly provided.the disposition of the ring was expressly provided for in the agreement,plaintiff was given her jewelry.any extant choses in action against defendant,however,were not expressly provided for in the agreement,therefore,they were retained by erstad as part of his personal property.
to be sure,erstad could have transferred or assigned his rights to legal recourse to plaintiff see,horton motor,a right arising out of an obligation,a thing in action,is the property of the person to whom the right is due and may be transferred,but there are no allegations erstad either did so or manifested an intention to do so.see,krusi amoroso construction th,d vaughn dame construction d.see also nisewanger lane,under north dakota law,when a chose in action is assignable,the clear intent to assign must be established.
third party beneficiary 
the fact that erstad did not assign or transfer his rights to plaintiff does not mean she is without recourse.for although plaintiff does not have erstad rights by virtue of the divorce judgment,she nonetheless has standing in her own right to sue for breach of contract as a third party beneficiary under the allegation,inter alia,that d efendant entered into a written contract with plaintiff fiancée sic to purchase the subject engagement ring for the sole and stated purpose of giving it to plaintiff.
civil code section provides a contract,made expressly for the benefit of a third person,may be enforced by him or her at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.because third party beneficiary status is a matter of contract interpretation,a person seeking to enforce a contract as a third party beneficiary must plead a contract which was made expressly for his or her benefit and one in which it clearly appears that he or she was a beneficiary.california emergency physicians medical group pacificare of california th,d.
expressly,as used in the statute and case law,means in an express manner in direct or unmistakable terms explicitly definitely directly.citations.a n intent to make the obligation inure to the benefit of the third party must have been clearly manifested by the contracting parties.sofias bank of america d.although this means persons only incidentally or remotely benefited by the contract are not entitled to enforce it,it does not mean both of the contracting parties must intend to benefit the third party rather,it means the this case,defendant jeweler must have understood that the promisee erstad had such intent.citations.no specific manifestation by the promisor of an intent to benefit the third person is required.lucas hamm cal d,see also,johnson superior court th,d don rose oil,lindsley d.zigas superior court d.
we conclude the pleading here meets the test of demonstrating plaintiff standing as a third party beneficiary to enforce the contract between erstad and defendant.the couple went shopping for an engagement ring.they were together when plaintiff chose the ring she wanted or,as alleged in the complaint,she caused the ring to be purchased for her.erstad allegedly bought the ring for the sole and stated purpose of giving the ring to plaintiff.italics added.under the alleged facts,the jeweler must have understood erstad intent to enter the sales contract for plaintiff benefit.thus,plaintiff has adequately pleaded her status as a third party beneficiary,and she is entitled to proceed with her contract claim against defendant to the extent it is not.
with regard to the limitations period,defendant incorrectly argued the complaint was by code of civil procedure section statute of limitations applicable to oral contracts,the salesperson alleged statement about the quality of the diamond.however,the applicable limitations period for breach of warranty in a contract for sale of goods is not set forth in the code of civil procedure,but in california uniform commercial code section,which provides a limitations period for any contract for sale,regardless of whether the contract is written or oral.see filmservice laboratories,harvey bernhard enterprises,d.the term any contract for sale as used in california uniform commercial code section includes an oral agreement see also hachten stewart,d supp,to the same effect.there can be no legitimate question the complaint is timely under the apt statute.
breach of of express warranty 
plaintiff breach of contract claim is based on allegations of defendant breach of express warranty in representing the engagement diamond was of an clarity rating,when in actuality it was of an inferior quality.other than noting the breach of express warranty claim is adequately pleaded,and that plaintiff is entitled to pursue it as a third party beneficiary,we express no opinion on its ultimate viability.it will be for the factfinder to determine from all the circumstances whether defendant statements regarding the clarity rating of the diamond constituted an express warranty under california uniform commercial code section or were merely nonactionable expressions of opinion in any event,this is the only cause of action on which plaintiff may proceed,as we discuss more fully,post.
rescission 
plaintiff has attempted to plead a separate cause of action for rescission.she is not entitled to that remedy.civil code section provides,a contract,made expressly for the benefit of a third person,may be enforced by him or her at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.italics added.but only the parties to the contract may rescind it.civil code section provides,in pertinent part,a a contract may be rescinded if all the parties thereto consent.b a party to a contract may rescind the contract in the following cases if the consent of the party rescinding,or of any party jointly contracting with him or her,was given by mistake,or obtained through duress,menace,fraud,or undue influence,exercised by or with the connivance of the party as to whom he or she rescinds,or of any other party to the contract jointly interested with such party.if the consideration for the obligation of the rescinding party fails,in whole or in part,through the fault of the party as to whom he or she rescinds.italics added.
we have found no cases specifically holding the rescission remedy unavailable to a third party beneficiary,but the proposition is to a degree that might well explain the absence of precedent.civil code section grants a third party beneficiary the right to enforce the contract,not rescind it,and civil code section limits its grant of rescission rights to the contracting parties.not only do the relevant statutes demand making rescission unavailable to a third party beneficiary,but common sense compels the conclusion.the interest of the third party beneficiary is as
