evan and barbara olson the olsons appeal from a judgment entered after the trial court adjudicated three causes of action against them in a bench trial and granted respondent six rivers national bank six rivers summary judgment on the remaining two causes of action.the olsons alleged that a customer of six rivers had fraudulently induced them to take out a loan from six rivers for the purpose of investing in the customer company,which subsequently declared bankruptcy.they now contend the trial court erred by concluding the loan transaction was not subject to the california securities laws,declining to rescind the transaction based on theories of concealment and failure of consideration and granting summary judgment on causes of action under the california consumer credit reporting agencies act.
we will affirm the judgment.in the published portion of this opinion,we consider whether six rivers violated the california consumer credit reporting agencies act by requesting credit information pertaining to evan olson evan in connection with a loan to be made to barbara olson barbara.we conclude the bank request was permissible under subdivision a a and f of civil code section.
facts and procedural history 
the olsons sued six rivers for tort damages,declaratory relief,rescission,and violation of the california consumer credit reporting agencies act credit reporting act.the trial court denied six rivers motion to compel arbitration,yet stayed arbitration pending the outcome of the litigation.in an earlier appeal appeal no,we affirmed the stay of arbitration and reversed in part the denial of the motion to compel arbitration.in particular,we held the tort damage claims were subject to the arbitration clause,while the equitable claims for rescission and declaratory relief,and the claims under the credit reporting act,were not.
upon remand,six rivers moved to bifurcate the equitable causes of action from the causes of action under the credit reporting act.the court granted the motion and ordered the equitable causes of action tried first.
bench trial on equitable causes of action 
the olsons sought a judicial declaration that their loans from six rivers were illegal,particularly under the california securities laws they also sought rescission on the grounds of intentional misrepresentation,concealment,negligent misrepresentation,and failure of consideration.the evidence at trial included the following.
in,six rivers made a sba small business administration guaranteed loan to information management consultants imc,a medical transcribing business.six rivers loaned imc an additional in september.in regard to these loans,six rivers dealt primarily with imc partner barbara oliver oliver,who also had a personal account at the bank.
oliver began dating evan cousin,and befriended the olsons in january oliver discussed imc with barbara for some time,indicating that imc was successful and was working on obtaining a contract with amador hospital.in addition,oliver stated,when imc obtained the hospital contract it would hire barbara as its executive director at a salary of per year.the proposed salary at imc was about more than barbara salary as a postal window clerk oliver did not tell barbara that imc was losing money and had outstanding loans from six rivers.
in march,six rivers loaned imc another.the following month,oliver met with six rivers to obtain yet more funding.as memorialized in the notes of six rivers junior loan officer kelli denney denney,oliver provided financial projections indicating imc would become profitable if it obtained at least one contract generating more income.as of april,imc account at six rivers was overdrawn by,and oliver personal account was overdrawn by.
on april,six rivers loaned imc approximately as additional working capital.that same date,six rivers gave oliver a home equity loan,based on a house appraisal showing a value of.oliver did not tell six rivers the house had never been built,however,and by the time six rivers discovered this problem through a title inspection,the funds had already been disbursed.six rivers later sold its interest in the property at a loss.
oliver again met with denney at six rivers on june,maintaining that imc needed yet more money.imc financial reports showed total accounts payable of,of which pertained to accounts older than days.imc had lost over in april and over in may,and denney did not believe imc would improve financially.nevertheless,based on oliver credit and repayment ability and notwithstanding the incident with the house appraisal,six rivers extended a loan to oliver,and oliver signed the proceeds over to imc.as of june,imc account at six rivers was overdrawn by more than.
on june,oliver telephoned barbara.oliver asked barbara to take out a loan at six rivers on behalf of imc,explaining that imc could not borrow money at the time and might close temporarily without an immediate cash infusion.according to barbara,oliver told her that be responsible for the loan payments.
while barbara contends that oliver first mentioned the loan idea on june and rushed her into it that day,there was evidence barbara had participated in oliver pursuit of the loan days earlier.six rivers apparently received barbara personal financial statement,dated june,on a six rivers form,on june.six rivers obtained the olsons credit report on that date,and the olsons financial statement was the only source of the social security numbers required to order the report.the evidence at trial suggested oliver wrote much of the financial statement,but barbara had signed it.
at any rate,on june,six rivers senior lender,gene ulrich ulrich,instructed junior lender tammy brown brown to prepare documents enabling barbara to borrow.denney was on vacation at the time.that same day,barbara and oliver met with brown and six rivers senior loan officer susan mccarthy,at the bank.barbara was introduced as someone who was going to come to work for imc.she did not disclose her purported understanding that she would not be responsible for repaying the loan.
mccarthy had asked brown to attend the meeting to make sure barbara understood what she was doing and the risk she was taking by using the loan proceeds to invest in imc.meanwhile,mccarthy personally informed barbara that imc had a lot of potential.no one from six rivers told barbara the specifics of imc financial condition,such as how much money it was losing,how much it owed the bank,or how much its account was overdrawn.nor was it disclosed that some of the funds barbara was to deposit into imc account would be used to make payments on six rivers loans to imc and cover imc overdrafts,or that all of imc assets were pledged to six rivers as collateral.according to brown,barbara was told imc was a young company that was struggling,and without this capital infusion,it was going to close its doors in addition,mccarthy asked barbara if oliver had told her everything about the business barbara,thinking she meant what services the business provided,rather than its financial condition,responded in the affirmative 
barbara executed a promissory note to six rivers for,to be repaid in two months.in return,she received a cashier check that same day,without any restriction on her use of the funds.with brown assistance,barbara endorsed the check for deposit into imc account.her purpose for borrowing the funds,she testified,was to sustain imc financially so imc could give her a job.
brown thereafter prepared a file memorandum,memorializing the transaction.as the olsons note,in part the memorandum stated this loan request for was made to barbara olson personally for the purpose of investing into the information management consultant company.but the olsons ignore another portion of the memorandum,which stated at the time of loan document signing,present were barbara olson,barbara oliver,susan and myself,tammy brown.we had a discussion about imc in which susan made very clear to barbara olson the weak financial condition of the imc company.olson reiterated that she understood the financial status of the company and was very aware that her investment was at risk,but it was a risk that she was wanting to take.italics added.
upon her return from vacation,denney signed the loan documents on six rivers behalf.of the barbara deposited into the imc account,over was used to pay down imc or oliver outstanding indebtedness to the bank.oliver transferred to her personal account.the olsons did not retain any of the proceeds.
on september,imc filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition,listing assets of and liabilities of.the next month,oliver initiated a loan from six rivers to the olsons,for plus to pay off the june loan.according to barbara,six rivers senior lender,ulrich,told her imc had the potential to be a million dollar business and it was so easy to run the business even he could do it.based on this comment,evan believed imc was a good business as well.he was not told of imc monthly losses or overdue accounts payable.
six rivers sold the imc assets in november,advising the purchaser of imc overdrafts and the fact that all of imc assets were collateral for six rivers loans.in july,oliver filed her own bankruptcy petition.her former business partner asserted at trial that she was habitually dishonest and untruthful.
banking expert wayne shaffer opined that six rivers actions in connection with the june loan did not meet industry standards.in years as a lending officer,shaffer testified,he had never approved a loan like the june loan to barbara.also,according to shaffer,six rivers had a conflict of interest in the transaction,violated its own lending policies and standards,improperly used oliver as an intermediary by allowing her to complete barbara loan application documents and deliver them to the bank,and represented to barbara that imc had a lot of potential,even though its financial condition made it extremely unlikely imc would survive.shaffer further offered that six rivers assumed the role of investment advisor to barbara,with a duty of full disclosure,yet failed to adequately disclose imc financial condition.
the court issued a memorandum of tentative decision rejecting the olsons claims,and the olsons requested a formal statement of decision.the court entered its statement of decision on december.
summary judgment on claims under the consumer credit reporting act 
after prevailing at the bench trial,six rivers filed a motion for summary judgment as to the olsons remaining two causes of action under the credit reporting act.as discussed further post,the motion was granted.judgment was entered,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
as mentioned,the olsons contend the june promissory note was an illegal contract,the note should have been rescinded,and summary judgment should not have been granted as to their claims under the credit reporting act.they fail to establish reversible error.
credit reporting act first second causes of action 
as relevant here,the credit reporting act limits the dissemination of consumer credit information.in their first and second causes of action,the olsons claimed that six rivers improperly accessed evan credit file when evaluating barbara credit worthiness for the june loan.we begin our analysis of the court grant of summary judgment on these claims with a brief discussion of pertinent provisions of the credit reporting act.
the credit reporting act 
under civil code section,subdivision c,a consumer credit report is any written,oral,or other communication of any information by a consumer credit reporting agency bearing on a consumer credit worthiness,credit standing,or credit capacity,which is used or is expected to be used,or collected in whole or in part,for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer eligibility for credit to be used primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,or employment purposes,or hiring of a dwelling unit,as defined in subdivision c of section,or other purposes authorized in section.the parties do not dispute that the joint credit report obtained by six rivers on the olsons including the information corresponding to evan in particular constituted a credit report within the meaning of civil code section.
civil code section limits the circumstances in which a consumer credit reporting agency may furnish a consumer credit report.as potentially relevant here,a consumer credit reporting agency could furnish evan credit information pursuant to evan written instructions,subd.a or for use in connection with a credit transaction involving the extension of credit to the or,as we shall see,barbara,subd.a a or for the bank legitimate need in connection with a business transaction involving evan,subd.a f.the report may be furnished pursuant to civil code section,subdivision a a where it is a credit transaction that is not initiated by the consumer if the consumer authorizes the consumer credit reporting agency to furnish the consumer credit report to the person,subd.b.
a person or bank who obtains a consumer credit report for purposes other than those approved in civil code section may be held liable for damages or a civil penalty pursuant to civil code sections and.the olsons alleged that six rivers became liable under these provisions.
the summary judgment motion 
in its motion for summary judgment,six rivers asserted the following as undisputed material facts the trial court had already determined at trial that the loan was not illegal,oliver was not six rivers agent,and the bank had not committed intentional or negligent misrepresentation or concealed facts the personal financial statement submitted on barbara behalf was signed by barbara and contained certain provisions and the bank obtained a joint credit report on the olsons using the social security numbers written on the financial statement.
in ruling on the motion,the trial court relied on the personal financial statement executed by barbara towards the top of page one,the financial statement read if you live in a community property state your personal financial statement should include information about your spouse.if he or she is not a for this loan,his or her separate property need not be included.unless you indicate otherwise,six rivers national bank will assume that all property listed is community property and that all debts listed for you or your spouse are community obligations.in the statement of her financial condition,numerous assets were identified as jt joint tenancy property.the financial statement also set forth employment information and income for both barbara and evan.near barbara signature on the last page,the personal financial statement read in part i we authorize six rivers national bank to verify or check any of the information given,check credit references,verify employment,and obtain one or more credit reports in connection with this credit application or in connection with any periodic review of any loans or credit which may be extended to me us.if i am married and live in a community property state,this authorization is also made on behalf of my spouse even if he or she is not a.italics added.
in her declaration opposing the summary judgment motion,barbara acknowledged that the signature on the financial statement was hers,but denied writing the other information on the statement,including the social security numbers.barbara also asserted that evan had not authorized her to consent to the release of his credit information.in his declaration,evan averred that he never consented or authorized barbara to consent to the accessing of his credit information.
the trial court granted summary judgment,relying on civil code section,subdivision a f,which allows a credit report to be furnished where a party has a legitimate need for the information in connection with a business transaction involving the consumer.the court explained barbara olson asked for a loan from the bank and provided a signed financial information statement in connection with the loan.although the loan was made in her name alone,the financial statement included information on evan olson.california is a community property state.as barbara olson acknowledges in her declaration,the bank relied on her husband credit worthiness for the loan.following a lengthy court trial,the court has already found that this loan trans
