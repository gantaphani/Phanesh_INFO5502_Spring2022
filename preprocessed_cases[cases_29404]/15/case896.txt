cpuc decision nos.
o p i n i o n 
petitioner douglas ames asserts the california public utilities commission commission or puc erred by approving certain revenue allocation and rate design settlement agreements submitted by real party in interest southern california edison company sce.according to ames,the effect of the approved agreements is to unreasonably flatten electricity rates for large power customers by reducing the rate differential between peak and hours.moreover,ames claims the decisions do not include any analysis or justification as to how or why these rates flattened,as required by the statutory mandates.ames also contends commissioner michael peevey should have been disqualified from participation in the pertinent proceedings.we reject each of ames assertions of error and therefore affirm commission decisions the initial decision and denying ames request for reconsideration of the initial decision.
as a public utility,sce electricity rates are regulated by the commission this case pertains to limited aspects of the rate approval process for sce general rate cycle.
phase of the approval process,which involved sce application for its overall revenue requirement,is not at issue.in phase,the commission approved a significant increase in sce revenue requirement and rate base from the prior general rate cycle 
phase of the process concerned sce applications to establish marginal costs allocate revenue and design rates for various categories of customers.on march,sce filed an application to establish marginal costs,allocate revenues,and design rates for service provided to its customers in connection with its revenue requirements for service for.protests to the phase application were timely filed by various consumer,commercial,and government interest groups.hearings were held and settlement discussions ensued.ultimately,sce along with the various protesting interest groups submitted six separate settlement agreements to the commission.
ames,appearing in the commission proceedings under the fictitious business name transphase company objected to two of the six settlement agreements the revenue allocation settlement agreement and the medium and large power rate group rate design settlement agreement.the commission approved each of the six settlement agreements,with some modifications.we shall focus our statement of the facts on relevant aspects of the two settlement agreements at issue and the portions of the commission decisions that pertain to those settlement agreements.
revenue allocation settlement agreement 
the following parties entered into the revenue allocation settlement agreement sce the utility reform network a consumer advocacy group the division of ratepayer advocates a division of the commission charged with representing the interests of utility customers california farm bureau federation agricultural energy consumers association representing over percent of california commercial agriculture interests federal executive agencies represents federal government agencies california manufacturers and technology association california large energy consumers association energy users forum indicated commercial parties california city county street light association the solar alliance the building owners and managers associations of greater los angeles,orange county,san francisco,and california and the energy producers and users coalition.clearly,these organizations represent a wide spectrum of interests including industries,governments,and individuals.
after its initial identification of settling parties and recitals,the settlement agreement plunges into dense,technical language.for instance,the settlement agreement leads off with a discussion of marginal energy costs,which are based on a forecast gas price of per million btus averaged over months from january through december.the hourly marginal energy costs derived from this gas price forecast using sce methodology set forth in exhibit sce updated are averaged by time of use periods.generation marginal capacity cost shall be based on the deferral value of a combustion turbine ct,with the installation cost annualized using sce real economic carrying charge recc methodology,less the estimated value of energy rents obtained by ct energy sales,which yields a generation marginal capacity cost of per kw per year.
next,a chart illustrates the different marginal costs for generation of energy.basically,it costs more at the margin to produce energy during hours than during or hours during the summer and winter.the settlement also identifies the marginal customer cost chart.this chart assigns different monthly costs to different categories of customers such as domestic,street lighting,and various categories of commercial,agricultural,and industrial consumers divided in part by their respective energy requirements.
the remainder of the substantive portions of the agreement discusses revenue allocation information.as explained in the commission decision,t he primary areas of dispute with respect to revenue allocation concerned whether there should be a cap or limit on the amount of sce revenue requirement that was allocated to any rate group and the allocation of certain revenue requirements among the rate groups.the revenue allocation settlement agreement caps revenue to each rate group so that no rate group shall receive an increase of more than above the system average percentage change,based on sce adjusted consolidated revenue requirement.the revenue allocation change is expressed not in total dollar figures allocated to groups,but instead as increased average rates in cents per kilowatt hour.
the commission concluded as to the revenue allocation settlement agreement the record of this proceeding,consisting of prepared testimony,evidence presented in the course of hearings,and opening and closing briefs,supports a finding that the revenue allocation settlement agreement fairly resolves identified issues and is reasonable.the settling parties recognized that,based on the revenue requirement proposed in sce general rate case phase application,all rate groups on average would receive substantial revenue increases when rates in this proceeding are implemented,as compared to the rates in effect as of december.the revenue allocation settlement agreement avoids further litigation and mitigates potential adverse impacts on any particular rate group and moves towards cost based rates.this move is consistent with the goal of the state energy action plan eap to create more transparency in consumer electricity rates,and to adopt rates based on clear principles.
the commission decision discussed transphase objections to the revenue allocation settlement agreement among other things,transphase maintains that there is no evidence to support a flat and differentiated department of water resources dwr power charge nor the methodology for the blending of utility related generation urg and the dwr power charge to achieve the and ratio.these arguments are without merit.this proceeding does not establish the dwr power charge.rather,the dwr power charge is determined when the commission adopts dwr revenue requirement and allocates this revenue requirement among the three utilities and this allocation is a flat rate.
the commission cited testimony by sce witness russ garwacki and exhibits introduced by sce as supporting the blended rates proposed in the settlement agreement.garwacki stated in his testimony transphase misunderstands sce basic rate designs.while it is true that dwr energy charges are billed on an equal cents per kwh basis a flat rate,sce establishes its urg rates residually such that the total time of use energy rates reflect marginal cost differences between energy supplied during different time of use periods.the weighted average of the urg and dwr energy rates reflect the appropriate marginal differences.the net impact of this adjustment on urg energy rates is that they are set artificially high in the period and artificially low in the period to offset the flat dwr energy charges.
the commission continued transphase also asserts that the marginal energy costs contained in the revenue allocation settlement agreement are not supported in the record since sce failed to include the necessary data inputs or computer models in the evidentiary record.transphase maintains that by failing to do so,sce has violated pub.and commission rule.while these rules require that computer models and databases be made available to parties,they do not require that these models and databases be made part of the record.regardless,the commission observed that evidence in the record allowed it to weigh the reasonableness of marginal energy costs.
in sum,the commission concluded we also find the revenue allocation settlement agreement is consistent with law.the process for conducting this settlement was in accordance with article of the rules of practice and procedure.further,as discussed above,transphase has failed to demonstrate that the settlement agreement is contrary to the public utilities code,prior commission decisions or other applicable laws.finally,the settlement agreement represents a reasonable compromise of settling parties respective litigation positions and is in the public interest.the settlement is in the public interest because it avoids the cost of further litigation,and conserves scarce resources of parties and the commission.further,the revenue allocation moves revenue responsibility closer to the cost of service while moderating adverse bill impacts on customers.
medium and large power rate group rate design settlement 
the following parties entered into the medium and large power rate group rate design settlement agreement sce federal executive agencies california manufacturers and technology association california large energy consumers association energy users forum the solar alliance the building owners and managers associations of greater los angeles,orange county,san francisco,and california debenham energy and the energy producers and users coalition.
it is difficult to summarize the agreement,as its contents are technical and reference detailed spreadsheets in the appendix illustrating the rates established for each of the pricing program options available for different classes of customers.the rate design settlement agreement does not start from scratch.it takes as given the existence of numerous customer categories based on energy usage,and several pricing group options available for each category of customer.the settlement agreement lists several common pricing principles,such as that current rate structure shall be generally maintained subject to specific changes mentioned in the agreement.the settlement agreement also coordinates the ratemaking process with other programs,such as related energy charges,demand charges,voltage discounts,critical pricing periods,and demand response credits.
the commission responded to transphase objections to the settlement agreement transphase challenges focus primarily on the proposed energy and demand charges in schedule tou and an alleged declining differential between and rates.we do not find any of these arguments to be persuasive or grounds to reject the settlement agreement.the proposed tou rates fairly represent a compromise of the settling parties litigation positions.moreover,transphase urges the commission to adopt the rate design in effect as of february,along with a further modification to establish a department of water resources energy rate but fails to explain why that rate design is reasonable and should be adopted.
we find that with a modification allowing participation in critical peak pricing programs,the medium and large power group settlement agreement should be approved.based on the evidentiary record of this proceeding,principally prepared testimonies,we find that the medium and large power group settlement agreement fairly resolves identified issues and,as modified,is reasonable.we also find the medium and large power group settlement agreement is consistent with the law finally,we reject transphase contention that the proposed settlement agreement is contrary to california energy policy objectives or discourages permanent load shifting pls.the settlement agreement adopts a default time of use schedule with critical peak pricing overlay for the customers with demands greater than kw schedule tou.this rate schedule is consistent with california overall goals to encourage customers to reduce peak energy consumption by setting different rates during time periods.the settlement agreement also adopts an alternative tariff specifically for customers with demands greater than kw who employ cold ironing and pls technologies schedule tou,option a.we believe this schedule provides adequate incentive for the installation of pls technology.
specific findings by commission 
in its decision,the commission also made a series of separately numbered findings of fact.we list several such findings that pertain to the issues raised by ames the settlement agreements were entered into by parties representing all impacted customer groups.the settlement agreements were reached after significant give and take between the parties.the revenue allocation,residential and small commercial rate design,and medium and large power rate group rate design settlement agreements are contested.sce methodology for blending of the department of water resources power charge and utility retained generation is supported by the evidentiary record.the revenue allocation settlement agreement is consistent with the state energy action plan.tiered distribution charges will provide signals to encourage conservation to all customers.the rate designs of the individual utilities should be consistent with the commission overall goals and policies.
the commission also made additional separately numbered findings,which it deemed findings of law the revenue allocation settlement agreement is reasonable in light of the record,consistent with law,and in the public interest.the proposed generation rates in the revenue allocation settlement agreement are reasonable in light of the evidentiary record.the medium and large power rate group rate design settlement agreement should be modified to ensure consistency with the policies for eligibility to participate in multiple demand response programs ultimately adopted in a separate commission decision.the settlement agreement should be approved,as modified.the evidentiary record in this proceeding supports adoption of the revenue allocation settlement agreement.
none of the findings examined the actual rates in detail,by setting out the numbers and explaining why they are reasonable.by its own admission,the commission findings amount to a review of the evidence.in decision the denial of ames motion for reconsideration,the commission stated transphase views the findings and conclusions as being too few and nebulous,suggesting that rate design decisions must contain individual findings and conclusions for each rate design issue or methodology in the proceeding.the law does not require our decisions to contain such extraordinary detail.even transphase notes this proceeding involved hundreds of separate rate schedules,options,adjustments,and terms and conditions,which spanned six settlements.citation.it would be unreasonably burdensome,if not impossible to enumerate separate findings and conclusions for each individual aspect.
ames objections to puc approval of settlements 
in his petition,ames raises a series of objections to the commission approval of the settlement agreements.generally,ames alleges sce failed to adequately justify the rates applied to large customers,and the commission failed to exercise the appropriate level of scrutiny to the settlement agreements and to make specific findings of fact supporting the rates authorized in the settlement agreements.ames accuses the commission of opaque,technical submissions by sce.
more specifically,ames takes issue with the commission failure to come to terms with an alleged decline in rate differentials between peak and times of use.ames contends sce energy rates have plunged over the last few years,going from a rate of cents per kwh in february to cents in the settlement agreement.thus,sce generation energy rate,which sce terms its utility related generation urg rate,has dropped by over percent from february,at the same time that the rates have plunged,the rates have inexplicably skyrocketed.the utility generation rate was cents in february,with a significant rise to cents as part of the rate design settlement agreement t he utility generation energy rate exploded higher by over percent.thus,even by ames calculations,there is still a significant differential between and rates,but according to ames the gap has narrowed 
ames also highlights several other alleged problems contributing to the flattening of rates the reduction of an demand charge the approval of flat,energy charges for energy obtained from the department of water resources an inconsistency between the rates set and state and federal energy policy and a general failure of sce to submit valid evidentiary support using appropriate methodologies.
sce testimony countering ames 
the record in this proceeding is voluminous.we note here only a few additional excerpts from the record that pertain to ames contentions.in rebuttal testimony pertaining to time of use tou rates for large power customers,sce witness garwacki explained sce customers with demands in excess of kw must take service on sce large power tariffs,in the three tou rate groups,which are differentiated by their service voltage levels.within tou,sce proposed a default rate which includes a critical peak pricing cpp overlay,a tou option a,and a tou option option a is available only to customers who employ new or existing renewable distributed generation technologies,cold ironing,or permanent load shifting pls technologies.option a does not have a generation demand charge instead,the generation capacity is included in the energy rates,thereby increasing the to rate differential relative to the default tou rate structure.the increased rate differential was created specifically to provide a rate incentive for pls and cold ironing customers.
contrary to transphase statements,the summer to energy price differentials have increased during the period from to the proposed levels in this proceeding from to furthermore,the summer capacity cost allocation increased by as a result of reflecting higher capacity costs in the summer period today relative to the general rate case.thus,according to garwacki,rates have not flattened from to.
in a response to a discovery request,sce seemingly acknowledged some flattening of rates from to.the discovery response accounted for the flattening of rates that did occur as follows from to general rate case,the relative reduction in the generation demand charge is due to the revised relative loss of load expectation lole study performed in.the case used a study from sce general rate case which had a summer allocated lole of.in,the commission adopted rates based on an updated study which placed the summer lole at sce general rate case proposal used the same study as that used for the general rate case.in terms of actual dollars due to rising capacity costs,the summer capacity value settled on in the general rate case was while sce proposed value in this proceeding is higher at.
garwacki explains in other testimony that ames desire to return to pre general rate case revenue allocations and rate designs is inappropriate for additional reasons.in,the commission established higher than rates for sce large power customers to mitigate residential bill impacts.in the and general rate cases,sce worked with parties to move the revenue allocation to one that more closely correlated with cost of service studies.the net result has been a decrease in the relative rate levels for tou customers.transphase denounces this return to revenue allocation as a massive revenue reallocation yet provides no analytical basis for its claims.while the disproportionately high tou rates from the post california energy crisis years may improve transphase business case,these rates are not cost based.
rejection of disqualification motion 
ames moved to disqualify commissioner michael peevey,citing two reasons for the motion.first,peevey was a senior executive at sce from to,and that history necessarily suggests peevey has both financial and emotional ties to sce.second,peevey allegedly prejudged the dispute at issue in a march,ruling in which he stated while i applaud sce movement to provide dynamic pricing tariff options for these customer groups,i feel that,consistent with the commission previously stated objectives,dynamic pricing options should be made available to all customers.therefore,i believe that a plan should be established to ensure that sce has dynamic pricing proposals for all customer classes when it files its general rate case phase application.
the commission denied ames disqualification motion.peevey left sce approximately years ago.moreover,public utilities commissioners are subject to pub.which prohibits public utility commissioners from holding an official relation to or having a financial interest in,a person or corporation subject to regulation by the commission.peevey lack of financial interest in sce was demonstrated by his form statements of economic interest,which were disclosed to ames.as to peevey statement applauding dynamic pricing,the commission found peevey statement makes no mention whatsoever about what the between and rates should be.at most,it signifies a commitment to having time of use rates available to additional classes of customers following the next general rate case.therefore,transphase has made no showing of any prejudgment or bias whatsoever with regard to its position in this case.

level of scrutiny applied to the settlement agreements by commission 
ames first claims the commission did not apply section and therefore did not meet its obligation to find the changes in rates were justified.
section provides in relevant part except as provided in section,no public utility shall change any rate or so alter any classification,contract,practice,or rule as to result in any new rate,except upon a showing before the commission and a finding by the commission that the new rate is justified,subd.a.the commission may adopt rules it considers reasonable and proper for each class of public utility providing for the nature of the showing required to be made in support of proposed rate changes,the form and manner of the presentation of the showing,with or without a hearing,and the procedure to be followed in the consideration thereof,subd.b.

although the commission did not specifically cite section or use the word justified,the commission clearly was aware of and applied the appropriate level of review to the settlement agreements the commission has long favored the settlement of disputes.however,pursuant to rule d of the commission rules of practice and procedure,the commission will not approve a settlement,whether contested or uncontested,unless it is found to be reasonable in light of the whole record,consistent with law,and in the public interest.further,where a settlement is contested,it will be subject to more scrutiny than an settlement agreement.w e find that the record supports a finding that the settlement agreements,as modified herein,including those that were contested,are reasonable,consistent with law,and in the public interest.accordingly,we reject ames argument that the commission was not aware of the proper standard of review to apply to the settlement agreements.
adequacy of findings to support conclusions 
ames also questions whether the commission actually engaged in the process it purported to engage in an independent review of the settlement agreements with specific findings of fact to support the commission ultimate decision to approve the agreements.according to ames,the commission simply acted as a rubber stamp for sce and the other interested parties that signed the settlement agreements by issuing broad,vague findings of fact to support its approval of the settlement agreements.
commission decision s shall contain,separately stated,findings of fact and conclusions of law by the commission on all issues material to the order or decision.findings are essential to afford a rational basis for judicial review and assist the reviewing court to ascertain the principles relied upon by the commission and to determine whether it acted arbitrarily,as well as assist parties to know why the case was lost and to prepare for rehearing or review,assist others planning activities involving similar questions,and serve to help the commission avoid careless or arbitrary action.california manufacturers,supra,cal d at.
on occasion,our supreme court has invalidated commission decisions based on the insufficiency of factual findings or evidence supporting such findings.see california manufacturers,supra,cal d at purported justification for rate increase on some categories of customers is conservation of natural gas resources,but no evidence in record explains why increasing rates on particular customers,and reducing rates for others,results in vindication of expressed policy greyhound lines,public utilities com.cal d,finding that the t he public interest requires the establishment of peak hour bus service is too general to meet requirements of california motor transport public utilities com.cal d,single finding of public convenience and necessity is too general to support approval of certificate sought by trucking company.
in this case,the commission,by its own admission,conducted a assessment of the settlement agreements and did not attempt to separately analyze each technical detail.but the commission findings were not so conclusory and lacking in analysis as to require reversal under the cases cited above.
moreover,the changes in rates and related changes affecting rate structures expressed in the settlement agreements are incremental and technical.the revenue requirement of sce is not at issue this issue was settled in phase of the general rate case.the amount of revenue sought from the particular categories of electricity customers is not at issue ames challenges the way sce differentiates rates for peak times and times,but does not claim the category of medium to large consumers is being overcharged or undercharged as a class.the general policy espoused by sce and the commission of charging more for electricity than electricity is not challenged.indeed,ames celebrates this policy.
the crux of ames dispute with the commission is that ames thinks the commission has not selected the optimal differentiation in peak versus rate structures to encourage the conservation of energy through permanent load shifting and other strategies.moreover,ames contends the commission has failed to defend the selection of rates and other policies that ultimately affect the difference between peak and rates as optimal by explaining why such differentiation in rate structure would be preferable to any other differentiation in rate structure.the commission instead found the settlement agreements fairly resolved disputes between various interested parties and was reasonable in that it fairly balanced all of the competing policies that must be addressed in setting rates for electricity consumers.we agree with ames that the commission written decisions do not attempt to demonstrate that rate structures created by the settlement agreements are optimal or demonstrably better than other structures that could also vindicate the same policy goals.
but ames has not identified any precedent for overturning a commission decision because of the lack of findings justifying a precise differential between and rates or any of the other technical adjustments to rates and credits that permeate the settlement agreements.the commission is charged with weighing a variety of interests and policies,and approving just and reasonable rates,not proving to a mathematical certainty that it has selected the optimal rate structure for each customer group to advance one of many competing policies.the commission adequately performed its task of making factual findings in support of its decision to approve the settlement agreements.the commission also adequately a
