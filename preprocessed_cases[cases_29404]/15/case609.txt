this case lends credence to the old adage that bad things come in threes.eric drew is a cancer survivor,who required experimental leukemia treatment.during his treatment,drew identity was stolen by a hospital worker.finally,when drew attempted to remedy the identity theft,the banks and credit rating agencies were allegedly uncooperative,and continued to report the fraudulently opened accounts,and in the case of one bank,the thief address was tagged as drew.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of chase bank on drew claims under the fair credit reporting act,b fcra.because issues of material fact remain as to chase alleged violations of the fcra,we reverse the judgment as to these claims.we also reverse the district court dismissal of similar claims against fia card services fia on statute of limitations grounds.we affirm the denial of drew motion to amend to reinstate his claims under california law.
nearly a decade ago,in september,eric drew began receiving experimental treatment for leukemia in seattle.after this treatment was unsuccessful,drew was hospitalized in minnesota from july to january for an experimental program that proved effective soon after starting his treatment in seattle,drew received letters and calls from banks and other financial institutions,which initially thanked him for recent credit application requests,but soon began demanding payments on accounts he had never opened.drew filed a police report alleging identity theft with the police department in santa clara,california,where he resided.the identity thief,who was a phlebotomist at a seattle hospital,was arrested and convicted a few months later,after news media publicized drew predicament.
unfortunately for drew,his saga was not at an end.drew had to close bank accounts,block credit reporting,and get automated consumer dispute verification forms acdvs issued to various banks that furnished information regarding the fraudulent accounts the thief had opened.drew claims relate to only two actors in this credit dispute chase bank and fia card services.
interactions with chase 
along with other banks,chase sent a letter to drew at his california address thanking him for applying for the credit card,and issued him a card on november.drew called chase to dispute the account in late november.a fraud department employee informed drew that the account had not yet been opened or reported,and that chase would contact other issuing banks and credit reporting agencies cras so that drew would not be associated with the fraudulent seattle address and the fraudulent accounts.chase immediately closed the account and reported it to the credit agencies as lost or stolen.it is undisputed that as a result,no charges could be added to the account.chase also faxed a copy of the fraudulent application to the police.
in the meantime,drew reviewed his credit report in.he discovered multiple fraudulent accounts had been opened in his name.on january,he contacted various cras to report the fraudulent accounts.the next day,transunion,one of the credit agencies,deleted various accounts,including the chase account,from its credit file.transunion also forwarded a block notice communication to the various banks,including bank one,chase and citibank,advising them that the accounts were presumed to be fraudulent and that the banks must contact the consumer and take measures to block any future reporting of the accounts.chase did not take any action in response to the block notice from transunion.the remaining banks blocked reporting of the account.
in early,drew returned to california,ordered and obtained an old republic credit services credit report old republic report,and discovered that chase had continued to report the account as lost or stolen in fall.he again complained to the cras.the second time was the charm chase deleted the account in february,and sent a notice to the cras to delete the account.however,in october,chase also followed up with letters sent to the thief address with the account number,and allegedly the identity thief seattle address as drew address.
ii.interactions with fia 
fia first issued a card in drew name on january,and so did not receive the january,transunion block notice drew wrote to transunion to dispute the fia account on march.transunion forwarded notice of the dispute to fia on march,fia received the dispute on march,and verified the account the very next day.drew claims he was not aware,until january,of fia investigation and verification of the account,nor that the account was still being reported to cras.
in april and may drew received several collection calls and account statements from fia concerning the fraudulent account he called fia on april,may and july,to dispute the account as fraudulent.in may,fia informed drew that an investigation had begun,but that the account could not be closed pending investigation.in a july conversation with fia,drew alleges that he was promised that collection efforts would stop,the fraudulent account would be deleted,and all records corrected if he completed a fraud affidavit form and sent it to the bank.fia received the fraud affidavit from drew on july,and closed the account on july,crediting the charges.
from july to january,drew was hospitalized in minnesota.upon reviewing the old republic report,drew discovered that the fia account was reported as a derogatory item,and his credit score had been affected.drew disputed the account again.fia discontinued reporting the account in october,but one cra continued reporting the account.drew disputed it once more,but fia again verified the account as belonging to drew with the thief address as drew former address.as of february,fia computer system continued to list the thief phone number as the home phone number for drew.
iii.procedural history 
drew first amended complaint alleged violations of the fcra as well as various california law claims with respect to chase and fia.upon challenge from the banks,drew dropped certain california law claims early in the litigation.in,the district court initially denied the banks motions for summary judgment on the fcra claims.drew then sought to revive his california law claims and chase and fia filed motions for reconsideration.in,the court reversed course and granted the banks motions for summary judgment,but denied drew motion for leave to amend.drew appeals both rulings.
as evidenced by the district court change of heart,the issues in this appeal are complex and present close questions of first impression,primarily because of disputed factual issues.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and reverse.vander united states dep t of justice,cir citation omitted.we affirm the court denial of leave to amend,which we review for abuse of discretion.jackson bank of hawaii,cir.
fcra claims against chase 
drew claims that chase fell short of its fcra duties by reporting an account that was actually fraudulent as a lost or stolen account that belonged to drew.he argues that chase should have blocked reporting of the account altogether.drew also alleges that chase reported the thief address as his own.
the fcra sets out a series of procedures that dictate how a furnisher must investigate and correct erroneous information.upon being notified of a dispute by a cra,a furnisher must investigate and,if necessary,correct the information it reports.failure to do so renders it liable to the consumer for damages.here,chase duties were triggered by the january block notice from transunion.although chase investigation was sufficient,factual issues remain as to whether reporting the account as lost or stolen may have violated the fcra.an issue of fact also remains as to whether chase violated the fcra by allegedly misreporting the identity thief address as belonging to drew.
triggering notice from transunion 
for chase to owe any duty to drew,chase must be notified through the appropriate channels under the fcra.chase first disputes whether its duties were triggered at all,because it never received proper notification of drew dispute as required by subsection b.b.this question is one of first impression.
chase duties under subsection b are triggered only after receiving notice pursuant to a,under which a cra provides a notification to a furnisher which includes all relevant information regarding the dispute.thus,drew direct complaint to chase in november would not have triggered any duty since it was unaccompanied by cra notification.see gorman.wolpoff abramson,llp,cir these duties arise only after the furnisher receives notice of dispute from a cra notice of a dispute received directly from the consumer does not trigger furnishers duties under subsection b.chase,however,received a notice from transunion,a cra,in january that would have triggered its statutory duties.chase disputes that this was a triggering notice,claiming that it was simply a fraud block notification rather than an automated consumer dispute verification,and transunion did not expect chase to perform any action.unlike chase,the statute appears more concerned with substance than nomenclature.section concerns the duty of a cra if a consumer disputes information in a report.in particular,a a provides 
before the expiration of the business day period beginning on the date on which a consumer reporting agency receives notice of a dispute from any consumer or a reseller the agency shall provide notification of the dispute to any person who provided any item of information in dispute in this case,chase,at the address and in the manner established with the person.the notice shall include all relevant information regarding the dispute that the agency has received from the consumer or reseller.
what chase disparagingly refers to as transunion fraud block notification was just that a notification within the meaning of a,sufficient to trigger chase fcra duty.transunion letter to chase stated that drew has advised our office that a fraudulent application was submitted to your company with the consumer identification,but without,knowledge and consent.even if the statute required the notification to tell chase what transunion expect ed chase to it does letter noted that transunion had blocked the account,and suggested that chase should do the same you must ensure that the account is unblocked only if i t was blocked due to fraud or t he consumer agrees that the blocked information was blocked in error.additionally,please take all of the necessary steps to ensure that this account is not reported by you emphasis added.ultimately,as we have noted in gorman,an inadequate cra notification may limit the scope of a furnisher b duty,for example,by excusing a more limited investigation it does not,however,eliminate the duty altogether.gorman,at.accordingly,although drew communication with chase had no statutory impact,transunion notification was sufficient to trigger chase duties under the fcra.
statutory duties 
chase statutory duties required it to engage in an investigation.if the investigation found a problem with the previously reported information,the fcra then dictates that chase must rectify past misreporting by informing the cras of the problem.the statute also obligates chase to prevent future misreporting by modifying,deleting,or blocking the inaccurate item,as appropriate.each of these duties is laid out in a separate subparagraph of b 
after receiving notice pursuant to section a of this title of a dispute with regard to the completeness or accuracy of any information provided by a person to a consumer reporting agency,the furnisher shall 
a conduct an investigation with respect to the disputed information 
d if the investigation finds that the information is incomplete or inaccurate,report those results to all other consumer reporting agencies to which the person furnished the information and that compile and maintain files on consumers on a nationwide basis and 
e if an item of information disputed by a consumer is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified after any reinvestigation under paragraph,for purposes of reporting to a consumer reporting agency only,as appropriate,based on the results of the reinvestigation promptly 
i modify that item of information 
ii delete that item of information or 
iii permanently block the reporting of that item of information.
drew claims that chase failed in its duties because its investigation in response to the transunion notification was deficient chase continued to report the account as belonging to drew,albeit as lost or stolen,instead of blocking it and chase reported the thief address as drew.the first of these claims fails as a matter of law but,as to the remaining two allegations,drew has sufficiently raised material factual issues that permit his claim to survive summary judgment.
chase investigation was legally sufficient under subparagraph a.drew had already spoken directly to chase about the fraud in november chase conducted an investigation and was already one step ahead of transunion by the time it received the fraud notification in january.chase investigation had in fact yielded the correct result the bank concluded that the account was fraudulent and reported the fraud to the police.transunion report did not indicat e that the initial investigation lacked reliability or that new information was available to discover,and therefore,chase was under no duty to repeat its investigation.gorman,at.thus,chase complied with its investigatory duties under subparagraph a.
the most thorough investigation means nothing,however,if the results of the investigation are not put to good use.subparagraphs d and e of b required chase to rectify past misreporting and prevent future misreporting of information that is incomplete and inaccurate.drew raises a material issue of fact as to whether reporting that the fraudulent account was lost or stolen constituted incomplete and inaccurate reporting in violation of subparagraphs d and e.
a n item on a credit report can be incomplete or inaccurate because it is patently incorrect,or because it is misleading in such a way and to such an extent that it can be expected to adversely affect credit decisions.carvalho equifax info,llc,cir quoting gorman,at emphasis added.although we have never squarely addressed the issue,our precedent suggests that,at the very least,information that is inaccurate on its face,is patently incorrect.id.at noting that there was no patent error because the information reported was correct on its face see also koropoulos v.the credit bureau,suggesting that under,a cra is liable for reporting information that is technically untrue,as well as in various other circumstances.a jury may well find that reporting the fraudulently opened account as a lost or stolen account belonging to drew was untrue or facially inaccurate.
the district court dismissal of drew claim appears to flow largely from its exclusion as hearsay of a key piece of evidence,the old republic report,which shows that chase reported the item as drew lost or stolen account.without this report,there was scant evidence that chase had engaged in misreporting.however,the court ruling was in error.
in gorman,mbna bank asserted that a credit report offered in support of plaintiff gorman claim regarding the bank failure to report a dispute was hearsay.as we explained 
gorman does not rely on the credit reports for the truth of the matter asserted therein in fact,as he notes,he disputes the truth of their contents.instead,gorman offers them to prove that no statement noticing the dispute was made.if the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made the statement is not hearsay.
at quoting united states dorsey,cir ellipsis in original.similarly here,drew offers the report only to show that the statement was made rather than for its truth.like gorman,drew claims the report is inaccurate finally,even if the report were inadmissible,like the plaintiff in gorman,drew represents that he had reviewed the report and discovered the disputed information under gorman,drew statement itself is admissible evidence of the misreporting.id.
a jury may also conclude that reporting the identity thief address as drew violated chase duty under the statute to correct inaccurate reporting.subparagraph e requires
