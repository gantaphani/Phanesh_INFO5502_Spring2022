opinion of the court 
this class action involves tires rfts.as their name suggests,they can run while flat.even if an rft suffers a total and abrupt loss of air pressure from a puncture or other road damage,the vehicle it is on remains stable and can continue driving for to miles at a speed of up to miles per hour.
jeffrey marcus leased a bmw convertible equipped with four bridgestone rfts.unfortunately,he experienced four flat tires during his lease.in each case,the rft worked as intended.even though the tire lost air pressure,marcus was able to drive his car to a bmw dealer to have the tire replaced.unsatisfied nonetheless,marcus sued bridgestone corporation,bridgestone americas tire operations,llc bato together bridgestone,and bmw of north america,llc bmw,asserting consumer fraud,breach of warranty,and breach of contract claims.among other things,he claims that bridgestone rfts are defective because they are highly susceptible to flats,punctures and bubbles,and fail at a significantly higher rate than radial tires or other tires can not be repaired,only replaced,in the event of a small puncture and are exorbitantly priced.he also claims bmws can not be retrofitted to operate with conventional,tires,and that many service stations do not sell bridgestone rfts,making them difficult to replace.he faults bmw and bridgestone for failing to disclose these defects.
the district court certified marcus suit under federal rule of civil procedure b as an class action brought on behalf of all purchasers and lessees of certain bmws equipped with bridgestone rfts sold or leased in new jersey with tires that have gone flat and been replaced.for the reasons that follow,we part from the district court.among other problems,on the record before us,marcus claims do not satisfy the numerosity and predominance requirements.we thus vacate the district court certification order and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
in july,jeffrey marcus a new york resident leased a bmw from an authorized bmw dealership in ramsey,new jersey.the convertible first caught his eye at another dealership in south hampton,new york.he saw the car on the showroom floor and,interest piqued,picked up a brochure.aside from visiting the dealership,picking up the brochure,and riding in a friend as a passenger,marcus claims he absolutely did not do any other research on bmw vehicles or rfts before leasing his car.
as noted,marcus suffered four flat tires during his lease.each time he experienced a flat,he drove his car to a bmw dealership in new york and had the tire replaced.bmw then billed marcus between to for parts,labor,fees,and taxes.see.after his first flat,marcus purchased a warranty for about,which covered at least some of the replacement costs for flat tires two through four.see.
marcus first two flat tires were not available for inspection in this lawsuit.dealer records show that a nail punctured the first tire and the second was replaced due to a blown out bubble.marcus third tire was replaced because he ran over a chunk of metal the size of a finger,according to his own expert,and his fourth because he ran over another sharp object that tore and gouged the tire and damaged the sidewall.the parties experts agree that the third and fourth tires could not have been repaired,and that any tire or conventional would have been damaged,if not destroyed,under the circumstances.see.they also agree on two other,more general propositions a tire can go flat or fail for a wide variety of reasons and not be a defective tire and to determine properly and accurately the cause of any particular tire failure,a careful and thorough examination of that tire is necessary.see.
the parties dispute what marcus knew about rfts and bmws before leasing his car and,more importantly,what other purchasers and lessees could have known.to provide a market and consumer perspective on rfts and bmws,bmw presented the expert report and testimony of william pettit.see.he concluded that a n abundance of rft information exists in the public domain extolling the safety and convenience benefits and discussing potential downsides.he pointed to bmw and bridgestone documents,their press releases and marketing brochures,as well as information from the public domain,articles in publications like consumer reports,businessweek,the wall street journal,and the new york times.
to take but a few examples,bmw boasts in its brochures that should you get a flat,you can still travel up to miles at mph,thanks to the bmw series convertible standard tires,so you can drive off a busy highway,out of a dangerous area,or just continue on your journey on a rainy night.in several other places,its brochures mention that the car comes equipped with rfts and that,d ue to tires,wheels,tires and suspension parts are more susceptible to road hazard and consequential damages.a warning about road hazard susceptibility also appears in bridgestone tire warranty low aspect ratio tires,with reduced sidewall height,may be more susceptible to damage from potholes,road hazards,and other objects such as curbs as well as in bmw press releases from july and march.see.in addition,the bmw owner manual for the warns drivers that,f or safety reasons,bmw recommends that damaged run flat tires be replaced rather than repaired.bmw approved tires brochure similarly advises consumers that w hile some tire manufacturers will allow tire repairs,bmw only recommends replacement of damaged tires.bmw and bridgestone also highlight information from the public domain.an april business week article says,tires are cheap.four bridgestone blizzak run flats cost about,compared with perhaps to for comparable conventional tires.sounding a similar note,an article from the june consumer reports mentions that some rft owners have complained about limited replacement choices and high replacement costs.however,this report concludes that d espite the disadvantages and inconveniences of tires for many,consumer reports believes that the safety benefits can outweigh the downsides.id.
marcus disputes bmw and bridgestone openness about rfts,the information available in the public domain,and whether this information is sufficient to provide consumers with notice about the downsides of bridgestone rfts.he offers internal bmw and bridgestone documents such as emails,research reports and marketing surveys to show that the defendants were aware that many other consumers were as displeased with rfts as he was.
after his second flat tire,marcus sued bmw and bridgestone.in his amended class action complaint,he asserts claims against bmw and bridgestone on behalf of a nationwide class,for breach of implied warranty in violation of the magnuson moss warranty act mmwa and on behalf of a new jersey for a consumer fraud in violation of the new jersey consumer fraud act njcfa,b breach of implied warranty,c breach of contract,and d breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.he also asserts a claim on behalf of the new jersey for breach of express warranty against bmw.
the district court denied marcus motion for class certification with respect to the nationwide class,but granted the motion with respect to the new jersey.see marcus bmw of,llc,ksh,wl.the court did not provide a definition of the class it certified,though it the docket entry for marcus amended notice of motion for class certification.that notice sought certification of a 
new jersey state subclass consisting of any and a ll current and former owners and lessees of,and bmw vehicles equipped with tires manufactured by bridgestone bato and sold or leased in new jersey whose tires have gone flat and been replaced excluded from the class and the sub class are defendants,as well as defendants affiliates,employees,officers and directors,including franchised dealers,and any person who has experienced physical injury as a result of the defects at issue in this litigation 
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under d.having granted bmw and bridgestone petitions for leave to appeal under federal rule of civil procedure f,we have appellate jurisdiction under e.
we review a class certification order for abuse of discretion,which occurs if the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,cir quotation marks omitted.w hether an incorrect legal standard has been used is an issue of law to be reviewed de novo.id.
iii.preliminary matters 
the class action is an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.wal mart stores dukes,d quotation marks omitted.to invoke this exception,every putative class action must satisfy the four requirements of rule a and the requirements of either rule b,or.see.a b.to satisfy rule a,
the class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable numerosity there must be questions of law or fact common to the class commonality the claims or defenses of the representative parties must be typical of the claims or defenses of the class typicality and the named plaintiffs must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class adequacy of representation,or simply adequacy.
in re cmty.bank of,cir quoting.rule b,the basis for certification here,requires that i common questions of law or fact predominate predominance,and ii the class action is the superior method for adjudication superiority.id.
t he requirements set out in rule are not mere pleading rules.hydrogen peroxide,at see also dukes.at.the party seeking certification bears the burden of establishing each element of rule by a preponderance of the evidence.see hydrogen peroxide,at.echoing the supreme court,we have repeatedly emphasize d that a ctual,not presumed,conformance with rule requirements is essential.id.at quoting newton merril lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir quoting.of the sw.falcon,d.
to determine whether there is actual conformance with rule,a district court must conduct a rigorous analysis of the evidence and arguments put forth.id.at quoting falcon,at.when doing so,the court can not be bashful.it must resolve all factual or legal disputes relevant to class certification,even if they overlap with the merits including disputes touching on elements of the cause of action.id.at rule gives no license to shy away from making factual findings that are necessary to determine whether the rule requirements have been met.
before considering rule a and rule b,we address two preliminary matters whether the district court clearly defined the parameters of the class and the claims to be given class treatment,as required by rule c b and whether the class must be and,if so,is in fact objectively ascertainable.
a.the class definition and the claims to be given class treatment 
an order that certifies a class action must define the class and the class claims,issues,or defenses.c b.specifically,the text of the order or an incorporated opinion must include a readily discernible,clear,and precise statement of the parameters defining the class or classes to be certified,and a readily discernible,clear,and complete list of the claims,issues or defenses to be treated on a class basis.wachtel guardian life ins,cir.clearly delineating the contours of the class along with the issues,claims,and defenses to be given class treatment serves several important purposes,such as providing the parties with clarity and assisting class members in understanding their rights and making informed decisions.id.
the definition of the class certified here is not clear and precise.rather than set out its own definition,the district court noted in its certification order that c ertification of the new jersey is granted,the docket entry for marcus amended notice of motion for class certification.that notice sought certification of a 
new jersey state subclass consisting of any and a ll current and former owners and lessees of,and bmw vehicles equipped with tires manufactured by bridgestone bato and sold or leased in the united states whose tires have gone flat and been replaced excluded from the class and the sub class are defendants,as well as defendants affiliates,employees,officers and directors,including franchised dealers,and any person who has experienced physical injury as a result of the defects at issue in this litigation 
although marcus notice of motion defines the new jersey subclass in terms of vehicles sold or leased in the united states,the court mentions in its accompanying opinion that the subclass is limited to those who bought or leased their cars in new jersey.marcus,wl at.
even with this correction,however,the parameters of marcus class definition are far from clear.as written,the definition seems to include not only owners and lessees who bought or leased a new or used bmw from a new jersey bmw dealership,but also subsequent owners and lessees who bought or leased a used bmw in new jersey from anyone,not just bmw dealers,and even subsequent owners and lessees who bought or leased a used bmw anywhere in the country from anyone whose bmw was initially bought or leased in new jersey.when confronted with this ambiguity at oral argument,marcus counsel clarified that the intent was to include only owners and lessees of new bmws purchased or leased in new jersey from bmw dealerships with bridgestone rfts.see oral arg.tr.even if the district court shared counsel understanding of the class definition,counsel post hoc clarification is no substitute for a readily discernible,clear,and precise statement of the parameters defining the class to be certified in either the certification order or accompanying opinion.wachtel,at.
in addition,the certification order does not define the claims,issues,or defenses to be treated on a class basis at all.the district court opinion does address marcus claims and the issues presented,but we can not find a readily discernible,clear,and complete list.see also id.at noting that an opinion that forces us to comb the entirety of its text and cobble together the various statements in search of isolated statements that may add up to a partial list of class claims,issues,or defenses falls short of the readily discernible and complete list of class claims,issues,or defenses required by the rule.
rule c b requires more,and thus a remand.if marcus continues to attempt to certify a class,he needs to provide the court with a more clearly defined class and set of claims,issues,or defenses to be given class treatment.
ascertainability 
many courts and commentators have recognized that an essential prerequisite of a class action,at least with respect to actions under rule b,is that the class must be currently and readily ascertainable based on objective criteria.see,john nat.sec.fire cas,cir in re initial pub.offerings sec,cir crosby social sec.admin.of the,cir see also chiang veneman,cir holding that defining a class by reference to those who believe they were discriminated against undermines the validity of the class by introducing a subjective criterion into what should be an objective evaluation,abrog.on other grounds by hydrogen peroxide,at johnson geico cas,d,agostino quest diagnostics,william rubenstein et,newberg on class actions,ed.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.if class members are impossible to identify without extensive and individualized or,then a class action is inappropriate.some courts have held that where nothing in company databases shows or could show whether individuals should be included in the proposed class,the class definition fails.see clavell midland funding llc,wl,at.june,sadler midland credit,c,wl,at.july,in re wal mart stores.wage hour,no.c sba,wl,at,deitz comcast,no.c wha,wl,at.july.
the ascertainability requirement serves several important objectives.first,it eliminates serious administrative burdens that are incongruous with the efficiencies expected in a class action by insisting on the easy identification of class members.sanneman chrysler.second,it protects absent class members by facilitating the best notice practicable under rule c in a rule b action.see manual for complex litigation,ed.third,it protects defendants by ensuring that those persons who will be bound by the final judgment are clearly identifiable.see xavier philip morris usa,d,ascertainability is needed for properly enforcing the preclusive effect of final judgment.the class definition must be clear in its applicability so that it will be clear later on whose rights are merged into the judgment,that is,who gets the benefit of any relief and who gets the burden of any loss.if the definition is not clear in its applicability,then satellite litigation will be invited over who was in the class in the first place.william rubenstein et,newberg on class actions,ed.
the proposed class raises serious ascertainability issues.in its briefs,bmw claims that it may be able to identify current and former original owners and lessees of bmw vehicles with bridgestone rfts which were initially purchased or leased from new jersey dealerships.bmw br.at emphasis in original see also bmw reply br.at oral argument,bmw counsel was even less optimistic.he suggested that bmw could not know which of the vehicles that fit the class definition had bridgestone rfts because t hey made in germany by a different company,and bmw does not have a parts manifest.see oral arg.tr.to complicate matters further,not every car that comes onto a dealership lot with bridgestone rfts necessarily leaves the lot with the same tires.according to bmw,dealers might change the tires at a customer request.in any event,says bmw,even if the proper cars with the proper tires could be identified,defendants records would not indicate whether all potential class members bridgestone rfts have gone flat and been replaced,as the class definition requires,because the class is not limited to those persons who took their vehicles to bmw dealers to have their tires replaced.
if marcus attempts to certify a class on remand,the district court adjusting the class definition as needed must resolve the critical issue of whether the defendants records can ascertain class members and,if not,whether there is a reliable,administratively feasible alternative.we caution,however,against approving a method that would amount to no more than ascertaining by potential class members say so.for example,simply having potential class members submit affidavits that their bridgestone rfts have gone flat and been replaced may not be proper or just.see xavier,d at rejecting plaintiffs ascertainability proposal to have potential class members submit affidavits about their smoking histories.bmw and bridgestone will be able to marcus at trial about whether and why his tires have gone flat and been replaced.forcing bmw and bridgestone to accept as true absent persons declarations that they are members of the class,without further indicia of reliability,would have serious due process implications 
numerosity 
rule a,which requires that a class be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,promotes three core objectives.first,it ensures judicial economy.it does so by freeing federal courts from the onerous rule of compulsory joinder inherited from the english courts of chancery and the law of equity.see rubenstein,supra.courts no longer have to conduct a single,administratively burdensome action with all interested parties compelled to join and be present.id.the impracticability of joinder,or numerosity,requirement also promotes judicial economy by sparing courts the burden of having to decide numerous,sufficiently similar individual actions seriatim.id.at.as for its second objective,rule a creates greater access to judicial relief,particularly for those persons with claims that would be uneconomical to litigate individually.see phillips petroleum shutts,d.finally,the rule prevents putative class representatives and their counsel,when joinder can be easily accomplished,from unnecessarily depriving members of a small class of their right to a day in court to adjudicate their own claims.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.
there is no minimum number of members needed for a suit to proceed as a class action.see stewart abraham,cir.we have observed,however,that generally if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number of plaintiffs exceeds,the first prong of rule a has been met.id.nonetheless,rule a requires examination of the specific facts of each case.of the eeoc,d.critically,numerosity like all rule requirements must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.see hydrogen peroxide,at.
when a plaintiff attempts to certify both a nationwide class and a subclass,as marcus did here,evidence that is sufficient to establish numerosity with respect to the nationwide class is not necessarily sufficient to establish numerosity with respect to the subclass.the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit decision in vega t mobile usa,is particularly instructive on this point,cir.there,the court reversed a finding of numerosity concerning a proposed class of all t mobile employees in florida who received commissions for the sale of cellphone plans.it held that the plaintiff could not simply rely on the nationwide presence of t mobile to satisfy the numerosity requirement without evidence 
vega has not cited,and we can not locate in the record,any evidence whatsoever or even an allegation of the number of retail sales associates t mobile employed during the class period in florida who would comprise the membership of the class,as certified by the district court.
yes,t mobile is a large company,with many retail outlets,and,as such,it might be tempting to assume that the number of retail sales associates the company employed in florida during the relevant period can overcome the generally low hurdle presented by rule a.however,a plaintiff still bears the burden of establishing every element of rule,and a district court factual findings must find support in the evidence before it.in this case,the district court inference of numerosity for a class without the aid of a shred of evidence was an exercise in sheer speculation.
id.at emphasis added citations and footnotes omitted.
like vega,marcus offered sufficient evidence to the district court to support a finding of numerosity for a nationwide class.according to bmw,it sold or leased vehicles equipped with rfts nationwide during the class period.but not all those vehicles came with bridgestone rfts.the group includes cars with rfts from seven different manufacturers goodyear,pirelli,michelin,dunlop,continental,uniroyal,and bridgestone.with respect to these vehicles,bmw recorded and produced unique customer contacts from consumers across the nation who called bmw to complain about their rfts.of those customers,specifically identified their rfts as bridgestone rfts.marcus submitted of the complaints as evidence of the proposed nationwide class numerosity.in addition,he submitted records,obtained from various companies offering road hazard products,showing thousands of claims made for road hazard damage on bmw vehicles.he even provided data the ratio of dollars received in premiums to dollars paid out in claims for one warranty company contracts covering bmws.piled on top of that were internal bmw emails about customer complaints regarding bridgestone rfts.
but after digging through this supposed mountain of evidence,we can only speculate as to how many bmws were purchased or leased in new jersey with bridgestone rfts that have gone flat and been replaced.to begin,we can only guess as to how many bmws were purchased or leased in new jersey regardless of tire brand.that information is not in the record.there is also no evidence of how many of the vehicles bought and leased nationwide had bridgestone rfts.no evidence shows that bmw purchased tires from its seven in roughly equal proportions or even if bridgestone was among its larger or smaller suppliers.as noted,marcus submitted of the nationwide complaints as evidence of numerosity.the complaints,however,do not indicate in any readily apparent way whether the complaining customers purchased or leased their vehicles in new jersey.four complaining customers did list new jersey addresses.see.but only two of these four customers referred to bridgestone rfts specifically,and one of them apparently accepted in lifestyle gifts as a settlement from bmw.see.and,like marcus,they could have crossed state lines to purchase or lease their cars.not to pile on,but marcus has not pointed us to any evidence in the record not in the customer complaints,the road hazard warranty claims,the data,or the internal bmw emails that identifies another purchaser or lessee of a bmw that was sold or leased in new jersey and equipped with bridgestone rfts that have gone flat and been replaced.in short,he has offered proof of only one potential class member himself.
nonetheless,the district court found that the new jersey class met the numerosity requirement because it is common sense that there will be more members of the class than the number of consumers who complained probably significantly more,and common sense indicates that there will be at least.marcus,wl at.that may be a bet worth making,but it can not support a finding of numerosity sufficient for rule a.
as we explained in hydrogen peroxide,a district court must make a factual determination,based on the preponderance of the evidence,that rule requirements have been met.see at.mere speculation is insufficient.see wright,supra,collecting cases roe town of highland,cir the party supporting the class can not rely on conclusory allegations that joinder is impractical or on speculation as to the size of the class in order to prove numerosity.quotation marks omitted.of course,rule a does not require a plaintiff to offer direct evidence of the exact number and identities of the class members.but in the absence of direct evidence,a plaintiff must show sufficient circumstantial evidence specific to the products,problems,parties,and geographic areas actually covered by the class definition to allow a district court to make a factual finding.only then may the court rely on common sense to forgo precise calculations and exact numbers.see in re prudential ins.of am.sales practices,aff cir finding numerosity requirement satisfied without pinpointing an exact number because the evidence suggested a class of over policyholders and c ommon sense suggest ed that it would be at best extremely inconvenient to join all class members lloyd city of,refusing to certify a class when,despite plaintiff mere speculation that the class could exceed employees,the evidence demonstrated that only the four plaintiffs met the class definition.
given the complete lack of evidence specific to bmws purchased or leased in new jersey with bridgestone rfts that have gone flat and been replaced,the district court numerosity ruling crossed the line separating inference and speculation.bmw is a large company that sells and leases many cars throughout the country,many with rfts.but the court did not certify a nationwide class of bmw owners and lessees with any brand of rfts.it certified a new jersey class of owners and lessees with bridgestone rfts that have gone flat and been replaced.it is tempting to assume that the new jersey class meets the numerosity requirement based on the defendant companies nationwide presence.but the only fact with respect to numerosity proven by a preponderance of the evidence is that marcus himself is a member of the proposed class.i f there are no members of the class other than the named representatives,then rule a obviously has not been satisfied.wright,supra.and we are not prepared to read the numerosity requirement out of the class action rule,as we have no authority to do so.gurmankin costanzo,cir.accordingly,we hold that the district court abused its discretion by finding the numerosity requirement to be satisfied with respect to the new jersey class.
commonality 
rule a commonality requirement does not require identical claims or facts among class member s.chiang veneman,cir,abrog.on other grounds by hydrogen peroxide,at.for purposes of rule a,even a single common question will do.dukes.at quotation marks and alterations omitted see also in re schering plough.erisa,cir.
marcus seeks to offer evidence about,among other things,whether bridgestone rfts are defective,whether the defendants had a duty to disclose those defects,and whether the defendants did in fact fail to disclose those defects these issues of fact and law or some subset of them apply to each of marcus causes of actions against each of the defendants,and are issues common to all class members.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the commonality requirement to be satisfied.
typicality 
the concepts of typicality and commonality are closely related and often tend to merge.see baby neal casey,cir.both serve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named plaintiff claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.falcon,at.typicality,however,derives its independent legal significance from its ability to screen out class actions in which the legal or factual position of the representatives is markedly different from that of other members of the class even though common issues of law or fact are present.wright,supra.
to determine whether a plaintiff is markedly different from the class as a whole,we consider the attributes of the plaintiff,the class as a whole,and the similarity between the plaintiff and the class.see schering plough,at.this comparative analysis addresses 
three distinct,though related,concerns the claims of the class representative must be generally the same as those of the class in terms of both a the legal theory advanced and b the factual circumstances underlying that theory the class representative must not be subject to a defense that is both inapplicable to many members of the class and likely to become a major focus of the litigation and the interests and incentives of the representative must be sufficiently aligned with those of the class.
id.at.if a plaintiff claim arises from the same event,practice or course of conduct that gives rises to the claims of the class members,factual differences will not render that claim atypical if it is based on the same legal theory as the claims of the class.hoxworth blinder,robinson,cir.
the district court found that marcus is typical of the class,because w hat is crucial to the typicality analysis here is that marcus and the class members purportedly suffered harm from the same alleged course of conduct the defendants failed to disclose defects in their products,misrepresented or omitted important information about the products,and made promises about the products that were not true.marcus,wl at.bmw and bridgestone argue that the court erred in its finding for three reasons.first,marcus performed very little research before leasing his car,whereas the average bmw purchaser or lessee performs significant research prior to purchase or lease.second,marcus leased only one model bmw with one kind of bridgestone rft,yet he seeks to represent a class composed of people with other bmws and bridgestone tire types.according to bridgestone,marcus claims potentially cover different tire designs of varying specifications,including size,load rating,and model type.third,new york law not new jersey law applies to marcus claims and,as a result,marcus is subject to unique defenses that do not apply to all members of the proposed class.we see no abuse of discretion behind any of these arguments.
first,even if there are marked differences in the amounts of research class members performed,these differences by themselves do not render marcus claims atypical.as discussed below,if a class member knew about the alleged defects prior to purchase or lease,then that knowledge could break the proximate cause link between the alleged defect and any damages suffered.determining whether a class member had such knowledge requires an individualized inquiry.that creates a predominance problem.if marcus knew of the defects prior to his lease,then he would risk having the causal link between the defendants conduct and his damages broken.if that were so,he would be unable to represent fairly the interests of class members who did not have such knowledge.that would create a typicality problem.but marcus may be in a better position than other potential class members because he did not do significant research before leasing his car.that fact may distinguish him from other class members,but it does not prejudice his ability to protect absent class members interests fairly and adequately.
the fact that marcus leased only one model bmw with one kind of bridgestone rft also does not pose a typicality problem.when a class includes purchasers of a variety of different products,a named plaintiff that purchases only one type of product satisfies the typicality requirement if the alleged misrepresentations or omissions apply uniformly across the different product types.see,wiener dannon,gonzalez proctor gamble,lewis tree serv.lucent techs,kaczmarek int bus.machs,may.the parties agree that different tire models and sizes,and different vehicles,have different performance characteristics,compositions,designs,purposes,and uses.but marcus alleges that the problems with bridgestone rfts that they are highly susceptible to road hazard damage,unrepairable,expensive,difficult to purchase,and that a vehicle can not be converted for use of conventional tires are uniform and apply to all bmw vehicles equipped with bridgestone rfts.
as we discuss below with respect to predominance,the district court did not abuse its discretion when finding that a defect making bridgestone rfts highly susceptible to road hazard damage will show itself in a substantially similar way across the various tire models and sizes at issue here.nor is there any indication that bmw and bridgestone representations differed significantly depending on the bmw or specification of bridgestone rft.therefore,the fact that marcus leased only one model bmw with one kind of bridgestone rft does not pose a typicality problem.
finally,i t is that a proposed class representative is not typical under rule a if the representative is subject to a unique defense that is likely to become a major focus of the litigation.schering plough,at quoting beck maximus,cir.other courts of appeals emphasize,as do we,the challenge presented by a defense unique to a class representative the representative interests might not be aligned with those of the class,and the representative might devote time and effort to the defense at the expense of issues that are common and controlling for the class.beck,at.here,bmw and bridgestone argue that new york law,not new jersey law,applies to marcus claims and,along with it,certain unique defenses.for example,they claim that new york law,unlike new jersey law,requires privity of contract in order to pursue a claim for breach of implied warranty.compare arthur jaffe assocs.bilsco auto serv,aff,with paramount aviation augusta,cir applying new jersey law.
the defendants presented this argument to the district court,but it did not respond to it.the court did conduct a analysis with respect to the class members mmwa claims when considering issues of predominance.it did not,however,conduct a analysis with respect to marcus consumer fraud or common law claims when considering issues of typicality,specifically whether marcus claims are subject to unique defenses that are likely to become a major focus of the litigation.but even if new york,rather than new jersey,law applies to marcus claims,bmw and bridgestone have failed to demonstrate how any defenses unique to marcus claims will become a major focus of the litigation.on remand,the parties and the district court may find that the contours of the litigation have changed significantly and what will or will not likely be a major focus of the litigation will have to be assessed.we leave this to the district court to address when and if the issue should arise.
under rule b,questions of law or fact common to class members must predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.this predominance requirement tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.amchem,windsor,d.to assess predominance,a court at the certification stage must examine each element of a legal claim through the prism of rule b.in re dvi.sec.litig,cir.a plaintiff must demonstrate that the element of the legal claim is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather than individual to its members.hydrogen peroxide,at.because the nature of the evidence that will suffice to resolve a question determines whether the question is common or individual,a district court must formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate in a given case.id.quotation marks omitted.
marcus asserts four claims on behalf of the new jersey class against bmw and bridgestone violations of the njcfa breach of the implied warranty of merchantability breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.he also asserts a claim for breach of express warranty against bmw.we consider the elements of these claims through the prism of the predominance requirement to determine whether they are capable of proof with common,evidence.
a.the common law 
the essence of each of marcus common law claims at least for purposes of our predominance analysis is that he purchased a defective product that caused him damage in his complaint,marcus alleges that bridgestone rfts and,in turn,the bmw vehicles that they equip are defective for several reasons bridgestone rfts pop or sustain bubbles from use under normal driving conditions,making them more susceptible to road hazard damage than conventional tires and other brands of rfts they can not be repaired in the event of even a small puncture and they are extremely expensive to replace.in addition,he alleges that his bmw vehicle is defective because it can not be reconfigured to operate with conventional tires.
the district court found that marcus could prove these alleged defects at trial with common,evidence.bmw and bridgestone contest the court finding with respect to the first alleged defect they also argue that issues of proximate causation,determining why each class member tires have gone and been replaced will require individualized inquiries that will predominate over any common ones.
common proof of susceptibility to road hazard damage 
according to bmw and bridgestone,marcus has failed to identify any particular defect that supposedly makes bridgestone rfts more susceptible to road hazard damage than other tires.in addition,they claim that any defect should one exist at all will not be evident uniformly across all tires,regardless of size or other specifications,included in the class definition.they argue that the district court erred by accepting without question marcus expert testimony on these points without considering their own.
in in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust litigation,we clarified a district court duty when confronted with competing expert testimony about a plaintiff ability to prove a claim through evidence that is common to the class.at.we held that the court obligation to consider all relevant evidence and arguments on a motion for class certification extends to expert testimony,whether offered by a party seeking class certification or by a party opposing it.id.at.we explained that e xpert opinion with respect to class certification,like any matter relevant to a rule requirement,calls for rigorous analysis.id.at.therefore,w eighing conflicting expert testimony at the certification stage is not only permissible,but it may be integral to the rigorous analysis rule demands,especially when a party opposing certification offers its own competing expert opinion.id.we further assured district courts that r igorous analysis need not be hampered by a concern for avoiding credibility issues.id.at.in that case,we ruled that the district court abused its discretion because it appeared to have assumed that it was barred from weighing one expert opinion against another for the purpose of determining whether the requirements of rule had been met,specifically whether the plaintiff claims were susceptible to common proof.id.at.
like the district court in hydrogen peroxide,the district court here was confronted with conflicting expert testimony about whether the plaintiff could prove its claim with common proof.on the one hand,marcus tire expert,charles gold,opined on the similarity of bridgestone rfts.after a detailed analysis of the thousands of pages of specifications produced,he found that all bridgestone tires relevant to this action,despite variations due to size,are substantially similar in construction.he concluded that a proven defect arising from construction would manifest itself in all relevant tires.in addition,gold suggests in his expert report that not only would all bridgestone rfts have a similar defect,but in fact they all do have a particular defect.he explains that the major difference between rfts and conventional tires is the inclusion of extra components added to the sidewall and assemblies of rfts,allowing rfts to be operated at zero,or near zero,inflation pressure.unfortunately,he adds,these same components stiffen the tire during regular inflated use and t he extra stiffness in rfts can make the tire more susceptible to road hazard damages during normal use.
bmw and bridgestone counter by highlighting that gold recanted his extra stiffness opinion during his deposition.he admitted he had no published testing,studies or scientific data to support his opinion.in fact,gold admitted that he can not offer an opinion,to a reasonable degree of engineering certainty,that bridgestone rfts are more susceptible to damage during normal use.when bridgestone and bmw moved to exclude gold opinion,marcus too seems to have changed course with respect to the stiffness theory.rather than rely on that theory,he argued and still argues now that bridgestone rfts are more susceptible to road hazard damage because they are low aspect ratio tires and that proof of this defect is found in the defendants own documents,not in any expert report.marcus br.
despite this apparent retreat from gold stiffness theory,the district court found that marcus has offered evidence that because tires are,universally,substantially stiffer than conventional tires,they are therefore more susceptible to road hazard damage.such evidence makes it likely that common issues of proof will establish the class members claims.marcus,wl,at.ultimately,however,whether bridgestone rfts are more susceptible to road hazard damage than other tires due to their extra stiffness,their low aspect ratio,or anything else is not the issue before us.our inquiry is limited to whether the district court abused its discretion when finding that,should a defect exist at all in bridgestone rfts that makes them more susceptible to road hazard damage,marcus will be capable of proving that defect at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather than individual to its members.see hydrogen peroxide,at.
on this point,the court discussed and apparently credited gold similarity opinion.marcus,wl,at,noting that marcus will also offer gold expert testimony that all bridgestone tires,regardless of model,are substantially similar and that gold expert testimony opines that all of bridgestone tires are substantially similar,irrespective of model.bridgestone offered its own expert evidence reports and deposition testimony from its experts,brian queiser and james gardner that the different tires and sizes in the class are not substantially similar given the differences in design,components and materials in different tires specified as standard and optional equipment for different bmw vehicles.the district court did not explicitly discuss these expert opinions,which challenge the similarity opinion of marcus expert.
although we would prefer a more explicit discussion and comparison of bridgestone competing expert testimony from the district court to aid our appellate review,we can not conclude that the court abused its discretion in violation of hydrogen peroxide.unlike the district court opinion in hydrogen peroxide,nothing in the district court opinion in our case suggests that it assumed it was barred from weighing the credibility of the expert opinions.instead,it appears that the court consistent with hydrogen peroxide simply found gold opinion about the similarity of bridgestone rfts to be more persuasive than the opinions put forth by bridgestone.this was not an abuse of discretion.
common proof of proximate causation 
having found that marcus could show a common,defect,the district court then found he could show,without resort to individual proofs,that this defect caused the class members damages.considering the damages that marcus alleges,we believe the district court causation finding was an abuse of discretion.
recall that marcus defines the class in terms of certain owners and lessees of bmw vehicles with bridgestone rfts that have gone flat and been replaced.he claims that a ll class members were damaged when their tires suffered a flat and they were forced to pay for a new tire or when they purchased road hazard coverage to insulate them from financial hardship due to cost of the tires.pl am.br.in support of class cert.accordingly,he asserts that e ach class member damages can be measured by the cost of a replacement tire.for class members who purchased road hazard coverage,the damages will be the greater of either the cost of replacement tires or the cost of road hazard coverage.id.at.
but these damages allegations beg the question of what caused class members tires to go flat and need replacement.causation is pivotal to each of marcus claims.see,stat.ann.cmt.discussing how,in an action based on breach of warranty,it is of course necessary to show that the breach of warranty was the proximate cause of the loss sustained,and that an affirmative showing by the seller that the loss resulted from some action or event following his own delivery of the goods can operate as a defense.here the district court should have addressed an undisputed,fundamental point any tire can go flat for myriad reasons.see.even defective tires can go flat for reasons completely unrelated to their defects.critically,to determine why a particular class member bridgestone rft has gone flat and been replaced requires an individual examination of that class member tire.see.these individual inquiries are incompatible with rule b predominance requirement.
in another rft case brought against bmw and goodyear involving nearly identical allegations as those marcus makes here,judge holwell of the united states district court for southern district of new york denied class certification and aptly explained why individual issues of causation create irremediable predominance problems 
even if the plaintiffs were to show that the goodyear rfts suffered from a common defect,they would still need to demonstrate that this defect caused each class member rft to puncture.but tires can puncture for any number of reasons,and not all of these reasons will relate to the defect.as defendants properly note,rfts can go flat for reasons that would also cause a standard radial tire to go flat,for example,if the driver ran over a nail,tire shredding device,or large pothole,or if a vandal slashed the tire p laintiff would have to demonstrate in each individual case that the tire punctured for reasons related to the defect,rather than for a reason that would cause any tire to fail.
oscar bmw of,llc,june,oscar i other federal courts have also recognized that suits alleging defects involving motor vehicles often involve complicated issues of individual causation that predominate over common questions regarding the existence of a defect.id.at collecting cases see also chin chrysler,refusing to certify a class of purchasers and lessee of vehicles with allegedly defective brake systems because,among other things,e ven where the alleged defect has manifested itself,individual issues of actual cause must be adjudicated.
marcus own experience illustrates the problem.of the two tires he presented for inspection in this lawsuit,one went flat and was replaced because he ran over a jagged chunk of metal and the other because he ran over a sharp object that tore and gouged the tire and damaged the sidewall.see.the experts agree that the two tires could not have been repaired and that any tire or conventional would also have been damaged under the circumstances.see.in other words,it is undisputed that even if marcus could prove that bridgestone rfts suffer from common,defects,those defects did not cause the damage he suffered for these two tires the need to replace them.in this sense,marcus is no different than a class member who,seconds after buying his car,pulls off the dealership lot and runs over a bed of nails,as neither can claim a defect caused his tires to go flat and need replacement.because marcus common law claims require an individualized inquiry into why any particular consumer bridgestone rfts went flat and had to be replaced,the district court abused its discretion in finding that the claims satisfy the predominance requirement.
b.the new jersey consumer fraud act claims 
next,we turn to the district court certification of marcus njcfa claims.at the outset,it is important to disentangle two fundamental questions that are at the core of the district court analysis but that can be conflated under new jersey law,what must a plaintiff prove to succeed on an njcfa claim and what evidence can a defendant put forth to rebut and defeat that claim and when a plaintiff seeks to certify an njcfa claim for class treatment under rule b,when might common questions of fact fail to predominate over individual ones 
we begin with examining the elements of a njcfa claim.the njcfa prohibits certain deceptive commercial behavior that it calls unlawful practice s.
the act,use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice,deception,fraud,false pretense,false promise,misrepresentation,or the knowing,concealment,suppression,or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment,suppression or omission,in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or real estate,or with the subsequent performance of such person as aforesaid,whether or not any person has in fact been misled,deceived or damaged thereby,is declared to be an unlawful practice 
stat.ann.the attorney general of new jersey may take action under the njcfa to address an unlawful practice and,in doing so,does not have to prove that the victim of the fraudulent conduct had in fact been misled,deceived or damaged thereby meshinsky nichols yacht sales.
a private plaintiff,however,must do more than prove an unlawful practice.another section of the njcfa provides that 
a ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of moneys or property,real or personal,as a result of the use or employment by another person of any method,act,or practice declared unlawful under this act or the act hereby amended and supplemented may bring an action or assert a counterclaim therefor in any court of competent jurisdiction.
stat.ann.emphases added.so,w hile the attorney general does not have to prove that the victim was damaged by the unlawful conduct,a private plaintiff must show that he or she suffered an ascertainable loss as a result of the unlawful conduct.meshinsky,at 
an ascertainable loss is either an loss or a demonstration of loss in value that is quantifiable or measurable.thiedemann mercedes benz,llc.put differently,a plaintiff is not required to show monetary loss,but only that he purchased something and received less than what was promised.union ink,v.at t,see also in re mercedes benz tele aid contract,t he sum of each class member loss is the amount necessary to fulfill his or her expectation of a functioning product.
importantly,unlike common law fraud,the njcfa does not require proof of reliance.see gennari weichert.realtors.that is,it does not require proof that a consumer would not have purchased a product absent the alleged unlawful practice or even proof that the unlawful practice played a substantial part in his or her decisionmaking.restatement second of torts.nonetheless,the cfa requires a consumer to prove that his or her loss is attributable to the conduct that the cfa seeks to punish by including a limitation expressed as a causal link.bosland warnock dodge,see also meshinsky,at a plaintiff must establish the extent of any ascertainable loss,particularly proximate to a misrepresentation or unlawful act of the defendant condemned by the act.quoting ramanadham mfrs.in other words,the alleged unlawful practice must be a proximate cause of the plaintiff ascertainable loss.
here,marcus argues that bmw and bridgestone violated the njcfa by failing to disclose salient facts about the tires that would be material to the average consumer who is not knowledgeable about tires.marcus br.at.specifically,he asserts that they failed to disclose the alleged defects previously discussed,susceptibility to damage,repairability,exorbitant price.he claims that,as a result of bmw and bridgestone wrongdoing,he suffered two forms of ascertainable loss a he spent money to replace his tires that went flat,and b he leased a product that was worth less than what he expected.see,alleging ascertainable loss as monies spent to replace the tires in diminution in value.
to the extent marcus relies on the cost of replacing his tire as his ascertainable loss,his claims can not meet the predominance requirement for the reasons related to causation discussed above.see oscar i,at d etermining whether each tire failed as a result of the allegedly concealed defect or as a result of unrelated issues,potholes or reckless driving habits,will devolve into numerous.the district court njcfa analysis,however,seems to have proceeded on the assumption that class members ascertainable losses would be the value of the product they expected to purchase minus the value of the product they actually purchased.the court noted that,with respect to ascertainable loss,t he relevant issue is whether the class members got less than what they expected.marcus,wl at.hence unlike his common law claims,marcus njcfa claims proceed on the theory that class members suffered a loss the instant they purchased or leased their cars,not when their tires went flat.compare,alleging with respect to njcfa claims ascertainable loss as monies spent to replace the tires in diminution in value,with pl am.br.in support of class cert.arguing with respect to the common law claims that a ll class members were damaged when their tires suffered a flat and they were forced to pay for a new tire or when they purchased road hazard coverage to insulate them from financial hardship due to cost of the tires 
in response,bmw and bridgestone point out that a person can not succeed on an njcfa claim against them if that person knew about the alleged defects,yet decided to purchase or lease a bmw anyway.in such a case,under the njcfa any alleged unlawful practice by the defendants would not have been the proximate cause of the knowledgeable consumer ascertainable loss.turning to the requirements of rule,they then point out that what a particular class member knew about bridgestone rfts before purchase or lease would require an individualized inquiry,making marcus njcfa claims not susceptible to proof with common,evidence.
the district court concluded that a presumption of causation should apply to marcus njcfa claims,and therefore that common issues of fact would predominate.see marcus,wl at.according to the court,a causal relationship between an alleged unlawful practice and a consumer ascertainable loss may be presumed under the njcfa when a defendant is alleged to have omitted rather than affirmatively misrepresented material information in written representations and when a defendant marketing statements do not differ from one consumer to another.id.if the court is correct,then marcus would be able to prove his njcfa claims with nothing more than evidence of bmw and bridgestone unlawful practices thus common issues of fact would predominate.
to justify this conclusion,both new jersey law and rule require factual findings that the district court did not make.what a consumer knew about bridgestone rfts prior to purchasing or leasing his or her car is highly relevant to whether that consumer can succeed on an njcfa claim.the district court correctly noted that t he relevant issue is whether the class members got less than what they expected.marcus,wl at.but what a class member expected of bridgestone rfts and bmws depends on what information,if any,about the alleged defects was available during the class period and whether that class member knew about it.if a consumer did know about the defects but,despite that knowledge,still decided to purchase or lease a bmw at the same price anyway because,for example,he or she decided that the other safety and convenience benefits rfts and bmws offer outweigh the costs of their defects then the consumer would not have received something less than expected.if the evidence indicates that this could be true for a significant number of class members,then common questions of fact will not predominate.instead,individual issues about what each class member expected when purchasing or leasing his or her car would swamp the inquiry,making the njcfa claims inappropriate for class treatment.because,as we explain below,the district court made its presumption of causation ruling without making key factual findings that the njcfa and rule require,it is an errant conclusion of law and an abuse of discretion.hydrogen peroxide,at.
the supreme court of new jersey has addressed when a presumption of causation may apply to njcfa claims in two cases international union of operating engineers local welfare fund merck,and lee carter reed,llc.both cases arose in the context of class actions brought under the new jersey rule that,like rule b,requires a finding of predominance.see.b.although we must follow a state highest court when interpreting state law,see.ins.wyndham worldwide operations,cir,we decide the legal standards that rule requires as a matter of federal law.see hydrogen peroxide,at.given this confluence of state and federal law,we take pains to isolate what the njcfa requires and what rule requires in this case.
international union involved a putative njcfa class action against merck,the manufacturer and marketer of the pain medication vioxx.the class consisted of payors,such as corporate health insurers and union benefit organizations,who administer health benefit plans and make payments to pharmaceutical companies for medications prescribed to their members.int l union,at.the plaintiff alleged that merck fraudulently marketed vioxx as safer and more effective than similar medications,and thereby caused class members to afford vioxx preferred status in their formularies,the approved listings of drugs payors have authorized for purchase.id.at.
merck argued that class certification was inappropriate because class members differed greatly in how their formularies dealt with vioxx,especially as new information about the drug became available.id.at.initially,some payors gave vioxx preferred status and assigned it to a low tier.others put it in a tier with high.critically,merck offered evidence that payors,when they eventually learned of the supposedly fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions,did not react uniformly.id.merck expert testified that decisionmakers for payors responded to ongoing releases of information about vioxx in different ways,with some altering its placement in their formularies.id.merck asserted that 
the essence of the claims must be that each class member was injured individually when it decided,based on defendant allegedly fraudulent conduct,to include vioxx in its formulary and,more to the point,when it paid for the drug purchased by plan members in its home state b ecause each class member made that evaluation at different times and based on different criteria and because each reacted differently with regard to formulary placement even after the facts that allegedly prove the fraud became known,there are overwhelmingly individual,rather than common,questions of law and fact.
id.at emphasis added.
the supreme court of new jersey agreed with merck that certification of a njcfa class is not proper when class members do not react to misrepresentations or omissions in a sufficiently similar manner.
plaintiff does not suggest that each of these proposed class members,receiving the same information from defendant,reacted in a uniform or even similar manner.rather,the record speaks loudly in its demonstration that each payor made individualized decisions concerning the benefits that would be available to its members for whom vioxx was prescribed.the evidence about separately created formularies,different types of tier systems,and individualized requirements for approval or reimbursement imposed on various plans members and,to some extent,their prescribing physicians,are significant.that evidence convinces us that the commonality of defendant behavior is but a small piece of the required proofs.standing alone,that evidence suggests that the common fact questions surrounding what defendant knew and what it did would not predominate.
id.emphasis added.
as a matter of substantive new jersey law,international union instructs that when a plaintiff knows the truth behind a fraudulent misrepresentation or omission,that plaintiff may not succeed under the njcfa.merck presented evidence that some payors knew about the facts that allegedly prove the fraud but did not alter the placement of vioxx in their formularies.id.at.even if other class members did not know that vioxx was not a safer and more effective pain medication than other available products,the evidence spoke loudly that payors reacted very differently to the available information.so from the class action perspective,the case also makes clear that the commonality of the defendant behavior is but a small piece of the required proofs if class members do not react to defendants conduct in a sufficiently uniform or even similar manner.id.
three years later,new jersey supreme court decided lee carter reed company,which the court described as fully in line with international union.lee,at.in lee,a plaintiff sought to certify a class of purchasers of relacore,a dietary supplement the defendants marketed as a product with the additional benefits of lessening anxiety and elevating mood.id.at.according to the plaintiff,the defendants misrepresented the benefits of relacore in their advertising and promotions.id.the court held that the plaintiff njcfa claims satisfied the predominance requirement.id.at.it noted that i f the entire marketing scheme was based on fictional benefits that relacore offered,then whether the class member enjoyed good or impaired health or took other medications would hardly matter.id.at.the court continued that w hen all the representations about the product are baseless,a trier of fact may infer the causal relationship between the unlawful practice the multiple deceptions and the ascertainable losses,the purchases of the worthless product.id.
not surprisingly,the lee court gave no indication that there was evidence of any class members who could have known that relacore was a worthless product but decided to purchase it anyway.such purchasers would not have been able to succeed on their njcfa claims under new jersey law.turning to the predominance requirement,the lee court noted that,i n contrast to this case,international union involved a proposed class of diverse entities,which the plaintiff did not suggest reacted in a uniform or even similar manner to the same information broadcast by merck.id.at,quoting int l union,at.
read together,international union and lee convince us that,before applying a presumption of causation to an njcfa claim,a court must consider not only the defendants course of conduct,but also that of the plaintiffs.specifically,it must consider whether plaintiffs could have known the truth underlying the defendant fraud.see mcnair synapse,jll,wl,at june,thus,to establish causation under the njcfa the new jersey supreme court in international union looked not only to the defendant conduct but also to the class members conduct.
although not binding on us,we also find the supreme court of new jersey
