an illinois loan company,midwest title loans,sued under to enjoin,as a violation of the commerce clause,the application to midwest of indiana version of the uniform consumer credit code a model code,provisions of which have been adopted in several states.et.the district court entered a permanent injunction,and the state appeals.
a provision added to the indiana version of the model code in and aptly termed the territorial application provision states that a loan is deemed to occur in indiana if a resident of the state enters into a consumer sale,lease or loan transaction with a creditor in another state and the creditor has advertised or solicited sales,leases,or loans in indiana by any means,including by mail,brochure,telephone,print,radio,television,the internet,or electronic means.d.if the provision is triggered,the lender becomes subject to the code and must therefore get a license from the state to make consumer loans and is bound by a variety of restrictions that include a ceiling on the annual interest rate that a lender may charge.the ceiling is the lower of percent of the entire unpaid balance,or percent on the first of unpaid principal,percent on the next,and percent on the remainder.there is an exception,inapplicable to this case,for payday loans.et seq.a lender required to have a license who fails to obtain it or violates any of the statutory restrictions exposes himself to a variety of administrative and civil remedies.the failure to obtain a license also voids the borrower does have to repay even the principal.and a borrower who has paid finance charges in excess of those permitted by the code is entitled to a refund.
midwest title is what is known as a car title lender.cash loans,variously called car title pawn,car title loans,title pledge loans,or motor vehicle equity lines of credit,are the latest,form of high cost,high risk loans targeting cash strapped american consumers.storefront and online lenders advance a few hundred to a few thousand dollars based on the titles to vehicles.loans are usually for a fraction of the vehicle value and must be repaid in a single payment at the end of the month.loans are made without consideration of ability to repay,resulting in many loans being renewed month after month to avoid repossession.like payday loans,title loans charge triple digit interest rates,threaten a valuable asset,and trap borrowers in a cycle of debt.jean ann fox elizabeth guy,driven into debt cfa car title loan store and online survey,visited,see also michael barr,banking the poor,yale reg.
until it received a letter in august from indiana department of financial institutions advising it of the addition of the provision to the code,midwest had made title loans to hoosiers as indianans like to call themselves at annual percentage interest rates almost ten times higher than the maximum permitted by the code.they had a maturity of to months,were secured by the title to the borrower motor vehicle,and were for no more than half the vehicle estimated wholesale value.the loans were made only in person,at midwest offices in had no offices in indiana.the loan would be in the form of a cashier check payable to the borrower,drawn on an illinois bank.the borrower was required to hand over a set of his car keys at the closing to enable midwest to exercise repossession of the car in the event of a default,so that it would have to go to court to enforce its lien should the borrower default.in this respect,title lending is like the alternative name car title pawns.a suit to enforce the lien would be infeasible because of the small size of the loans relative to the costs of litigation.
midwest would notify the indiana bureau of motor vehicles of the loan as soon as it was made,so that it would be noted on the official record of the borrower title,thus protecting midwest rights as a creditor from subsequent creditors to whom the debtor might grant a security interest in the vehicle.repossessions occurred,naturally,in indiana.midwest would arrange with an indiana firm to auction off the repossessed vehicle,and the auction would be held in indiana.
midwest advertised the loans on indiana television stations and through direct mailings to indiana residents.in it made more than two thousand such loans to hoosiers,amounting to percent of its loans that year.the two states adjoin and many hoosiers live within a short drive,or even a walk,of illinois.ten of midwest offices in illinois are within approximately miles of the indiana border.midwest discontinued its lending to residents of indiana when it received the notice that the indiana code applied to that lending.

a contrary school of thought points out that people who can not borrow from a bank because they have poor credit may need a loan desperately.if a ceiling is placed on interest rates,these unfortunates may be unable to borrow because the ceiling may be too low for the interest rate to compensate the lender for the risk of default.as a result,they may lose their house or car or other property or find themselves at the mercy of loan sharks.see todd zywicki,consumer welfare and the regulation of title pledge lending,mercatus center working paper,www.visited,jonathan zinman,restricting consumer credit access household survey evidence on effects around the oregon rate cap,banking finance forthcoming donald morgan michael strain,payday holiday how households fare after payday credit bans federal reserve bank of new york staff reports,http visited,mann hawkins,supra,ucla.at gregory elliehausen,consumers use of credit products do they know what they are doing networks financial institute working paper,may,visited.an annual interest rate of percent is astronomical.but a person who borrows at that rate and repays it two weeks later pays only in interest,
