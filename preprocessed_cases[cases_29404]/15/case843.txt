petitioner steve filarsky requested that real party in interest city of manhattan beach the city disclose certain documents pursuant to the california public records act,et hereafter referred to as the cpra or the act the city refused to disclose the requested documents,and petitioner stated his intent to file a judicial proceeding under section of the act to compel disclosure.before petitioner initiated such a proceeding,however,the city filed its own declaratory relief action pursuant to code of civil procedure section,seeking a declaration that the city was not required to disclose the records sought by petitioner.the city prevailed in that action,and the court of appeal denied petitioner request for a writ of mandate to overturn the trial court order declaring that the city was not required to disclose the documents.the court of appeal also held that the city properly could initiate a declaratory relief action pursuant to code of civil procedure section to ascertain its obligation to disclose documents requested pursuant to the act,even though petitioner had not commenced any litigation regarding his request for disclosure.
we granted review to decide whether a superior court properly may grant declaratory relief in an action initiated by a public agency solely to determine the agency obligation to disclose documents to a member of the public after the agency has denied the person request under the act.as we shall explain,we conclude that the legislature set forth in government code sections and the exclusive procedure for litigating the issue of a public agency obligation to disclose records to a member of the public in these circumstances,and these provisions do not authorize a public agency in possession of the records to seek a judicial determination regarding its duty of disclosure.
permitting a public agency to circumvent the established special statutory procedure by filing an ordinary declaratory relief action against a person who has not yet initiated litigation would eliminate statutory protections and incentives for members of the public in seeking disclosure of public records,require them to defend civil actions they otherwise might not have commenced,and discourage them from requesting records pursuant to the act,thus frustrating the legislature purpose of furthering the fundamental right of every person in this state to have prompt access to information in the possession of public agencies.therefore,we also conclude that the superior court abused its discretion in granting declaratory relief in the action initiated by the city pursuant to code of civil procedure section,and that the court instead should have sustained petitioner demurrer to the city complaint.accordingly,the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed.
in several letters sent to the city,petitioner,an attorney,sought disclosure of records related to the city hiring of a police captain.after the city attorney denied his request for disclosure,petitioner wrote to the city i find your response most perplexing and am offering the city one more opportunity to provide the information requested before i seek court intervention.petitioner letter concluded government code section provides that any person may institute proceedings for injunctive or declaratory relief to enforce the right to inspect or receive a copy of any public record.a prevailing plaintiff in litigation filed pursuant to the public records act is entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorneys fees.government code section d.
in response,the city agreed to disclose only a small portion of the records requested by petitioner.the city also stated in a letter dated april,you have indicated your intent to pursue this matter in court.we would certainly welcome the guidance of the court and may initiate that process ourselves.indeed,that same day,the city filed its complaint for declaratory relief pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the complaint alleged that petitioner has clearly indicated his intent to file a legal action against the c ity if all the documents requested are not delivered to him.it further alleged that an actual controversy had arisen,because petitioner contended that he was entitled to disclosure of the records under the act and the city disputed that contention.the complaint stated that the c ity desires a judicial determination of its rights and duties under government code section et seq and a declaration as to whether or not the city has an obligation to provide petitioner with the records he has requested a judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate in that declaratory relief is the designated form of action under the public records act as set forth in government code section,petitioner claims an immediate right to the records demanded,important privacy and confidentiality rights of the affected employee are involved and the respective rights and duties of petitioner and the city can not otherwise be determined.italics added.the complaint requested a declaration that the city had no legal duty to provide the documents to petitioner,and also sought costs and attorney fees.
in response to a letter from petitioner requesting that the city dismiss its action,the city wrote that the declaratory relief action was an accommodation of petitioner desire to litigate the matter.the city letter stated if we are incorrect and you do not wish the matter to be litigated please so state in writing and we will promptly dismiss the case.however,if it is your desire to have this action dismissed so you can simply file a new action to litigate the same issues we will not do so.
petitioner demurred to the city complaint.he contended that the complaint failed to state a cause of action and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction,because a declaratory relief action pursuant to code of civil procedure section could not be utilized to determine the validity of a request for public records.petitioner demurrer to the complaint was overruled,and the matter was submitted on the trial briefs of the parties.the court entered a minute order concluding that the documents requested by petitioner were not subject to disclosure as a matter of law.the notice of the order,prepared by the city,stated a final order granting declaratory relief in favor of the city in the action was entered on january.as far as the record and the briefing indicate,the trial court did not award costs or attorney fees,and no judgment has been entered.
petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to a provision in the act stating that any order of the court supporting the decision of a public official refusing disclosure is not a final judgment or order within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,from which an appeal may be taken,but that such an order immediately is reviewable by a petition for the issuance of an extraordinary writ,subd.c.after issuing an order to show cause,the court of appeal determined that the city properly had brought its declaratory relief action pursuant to code of civil procedure section,and that the records were not subject to disclosure.petitioner sought review of both conclusions.
we granted review but limited the issues to be briefed and argued in this court to the question whether a public agency is authorized to commence a declaratory relief action pursuant to code of civil procedure section to determine its obligation to comply with a request by a member of the public that the agency disclose documents alleged to be public records,and whether the superior court properly may grant declaratory relief to a public agency in such an action.
the cpra was modeled on the federal freedom of information act foia et and was enacted for the purpose of increasing freedom of information by giving members of the public access to information in the possession of public agencies.cbs,block cal d.the legislature has declared that such access to information concerning the conduct of the people business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.
a state or local agency,upon receiving a request by any person for a copy of public records,generally must determine within days whether the request seeks public records in the possession of the agency that are subject to disclosure,subd.c.if the agency determines that the requested records are not subject to disclosure,for example because the records fall within a statutory exemption see,the agency promptly must notify the person making the request and provide the reasons for its determination,subd.c.
the act sets forth specific procedures for seeking a judicial determination of a public agency obligation to disclose records in the event the agency denies a request by a member of the public.any person may institute proceedings for injunctive or declarative relief or writ of mandate in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce his or her right to inspect or to receive a copy of any public record or class of public records under the act.the plain language of this provision contemplates a declaratory relief proceeding commenced only by an individual or entity seeking disclosure of public records,and not by the public agency from which disclosure is sought.
after a person commences such a proceeding,the court must set the times for responsive pleadings and for hearings with the object of securing a decision at the earliest possible time.if it appears from the plaintiff verified petition that certain public records are being improperly withheld from a member of the public,the court must order the individual withholding the records to disclose them or to show cause why he or she should not do so,subd.a.
the court order either directing disclosure by a public official or supporting the decision to refuse disclosure is not a final judgment or order within the meaning of section of the code of civil procedure from which an appeal may be taken,but shall be immediately reviewable by petition to the appellate court for the issuance of an extraordinary writ filed within days after service of the notice of entry of the order,or within an additional days as the trial court may allow for good cause,subd.c.the purpose of the provision limiting appellate review of the trial court order to a petition for extraordinary writ is to prohibit public agencies from delaying the disclosure of public records by appealing a trial court decision and using continuances in order to frustrate the intent of the act.times mirror superior court cal d.the legislative objective was to expedite the process and make the appellate remedy more effective.powers city of richmond cal th,d,plur.opn.of kennard,conc.opn.of george.indeed,the act provision regarding a public agency obligation to act promptly upon receiving a request for disclosure,subd.c,the provision directing the trial court in a proceeding under the act to reach a decision as soon as possible,and the provision for expedited appellate review,subd.c all reflect a clear legislative intent that the determination of the obligation to disclose records requested from a public agency be made expeditiously.
the act includes protections and incentives for members of the public to seek judicial enforcement of their right to inspect public records subject to disclosure.the court shall award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff should the plaintiff prevail in litigation filed pursuant to this section.the costs and fees shall be paid by the public agency of which the public official is a member or employee and shall not become a personal liability of the public official.if the court finds that the plaintiff case is clearly frivolous,it shall award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the public agency,subd.d,italics added.an award of costs and attorney fees pursuant to this provision is mandatory if the plaintiff prevails.belth garamendi d.on the other hand,if the defendant public agency prevails,the court lacks legal authority to award costs to the though the agency would be entitled to costs in an ordinary the action is frivolous.although the city might ordinarily be entitled to its costs as the party prevailing in the lawsuit under code of civil procedure section,the legislature has provided otherwise in cases brought pursuant to the act.in cases brought pursuant to the act,the legislature has expressly limited an award of costs to the public agency to those actions in which the plaintiff case is clearly frivolous.as such,the specific provisions of the act must prevail over the more general provision of the code of civil procedure.citations.rogers superior court th,d.
we subsequently agreed with the court of appeal interpretation of the statute in rogers this statutory provision quite clearly addresses the circumstances under which both a plaintiff and a defendant can obtain an award of costs and attorney fees following a public records act lawsuit.for the plaintiff,he or she must prevail in litigation filed pursuant to this section,subd.d.for a defendant public agency,it must both prevail and have the trial court conclude the plaintiff case was clearly frivolous.ibid.murillo fleetwood enterprises,cal th,d,italics omitted.thus,unless the plaintiff initiates litigation pursuant to section that is clearly frivolous,the plaintiff is insulated from liability for the public agency costs incurred in defending the action.
the foregoing special statutory procedures governing a judicial proceeding arising under the act are significantly different from the procedures applicable in an ordinary action for declaratory relief pursuant to code of civil procedure section.unlike government code section,which limits declaratory relief proceedings to those initiated by individuals or entities seeking disclosure of public records,code of civil procedure section generally authorizes governmental agencies to commence any type of declaratory relief action hoyt board of civil service commrs.cal d.in addition,although ordinary actions for declaratory relief generally must be set for trial at the earliest possible date code civ,the court is not expressly obligated to schedule responsive pleadings and hearings in order to facilitate a prompt decision.furthermore,in an ordinary declaratory relief action,the prevailing party is entitled to court costs,see spiva phoenix indemnity d,but the prevailing party is not entitled to attorney fees in the absence of a contractual provision so providing spiva phoenix indemnity,supra,d at.moreover,a judgment ordinarily constitutes the final resolution of an action for declaratory relief pursuant to code of civil procedure section see maguire hibernia soc.cal d,and such a judgment is appealable pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.
in sum,there are at least four important distinctions between proceedings arising under the act and ordinary declaratory relief actions.first,under the act,only a person seeking the public agency in possession of the seek a judicial declaration regarding the agency obligation to disclose a document.in an ordinary declaratory relief action,however,either party to a controversy may initiate the action.second,in a proceeding under the act,the court must schedule the filing of responsive pleadings and hearings in order to reach a decision as soon as possible.such a requirement is not imposed upon courts in an ordinary declaratory relief action.third,if a person initiates a proceeding under the act,he or she must be awarded attorney fees and costs if he or she prevails,and the defendant public agency can not recover fees or costs unless the proceeding is frivolous.in contrast,in a declaratory relief action,a member of the public seeking disclosure can not recover attorney fees if he or she prevails,and a prevailing public agency may recover costs even if the individual request for disclosure is not frivolous.fourth,appellate review of the superior court ruling in a proceeding under the act must be by a petition for writ of mandate filed no more than days after notice of the ruling.on the other hand,a public agency may appeal from a declaratory judgment requiring disclosure of the records,thus delaying disclosure for a significant period of time.
these distinctions establish that permitting a public agency to file a preemptive declaratory relief action to determine its obligation to disclose records to a member of the public would eliminate important incentives and protections for individuals requesting public records.members of the public could be discouraged from requesting records,because a simple request for disclosure and a denial by the public agency could require the individual to defend a civil action in which he or she would be liable for costs if the agency prevailed,and in which the individual would not recoup attorney fees if he or she succeeded.the initiation of an ordinary declaratory relief action also could delay disclosure of the documents for a lengthy period,because the court would be under no statutory obligation to schedule briefing and hearings to expedite a decision,as would a court in a proceeding pursuant to the act.moreover,in a declaratory relief action pursuant to code of civil procedure section,a public agency could appeal from a judgment in favor of the individual or entity seeking disclosure,thus further delaying a determination whether the records must be disclosed and thwarting the clear intent of the legislature that the matter be resolved expeditiously.
in the present case,the trial court apparently determined that it was possible to apply provisions of the act to an ordinary declaratory relief proceeding.for example,the action for declaratory relief filed by the city,although denominated an action pursuant to code of civil procedure section,has been litigated in a manner suggesting that the parties and the trial court considered the action to be the practical equivalent of a proceeding under the act.thus,the city complaint alleged that declaratory relief is the designated form of action under the act as set forth in government code section,and the complaint sought attorney fees,which are unavailable in an ordinary declaratory relief action.in addition,rather than entering a judgment declaring that disclosure is not required,the court entered an order granting declaratory relief in favor of the city.although code of civil procedure section specifies that the court declaration shall have the force of a final judgment,which may be appealed pursuant to code of civil procedure section,petitioner sought a writ of mandate to review the trial court final order pursuant to government code section,subdivision c,which governs appellate review of proceedings brought under the act.
indeed,in this court the city contends that in a declaratory relief action initiated by a public agency pursuant to code of civil procedure section,a defendant who obtains a ruling compelling the agency to produce documents pursuant to the act is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs pursuant to government code section,subdivision d.in addition,according to the city,the defendant in such an action possesses a right to expedited writ review,as authorized by section,subdivision c.
the city position in this regard is consistent with the court of appeal decision in fontana police th,d fontana police,which considered an action filed by a public agency seeking a protective order to preclude the production of public records requested by the defendant.the appellate court determined that the action was the functional equivalent of a proceeding under the act,and that therefore the prevailing defendant who succeeded in obtaining production of the records was entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to section,subdivision d.fontana police,supra,th at,d.the only issue on appeal in that matter,however,was the defendant entitlement to attorney fees and costs,and the decision did not consider the propriety of the public agency initiation of an action for a protective order to preclude disclosure of the public records pursuant to the defendant request under the act.
neither the decision in fontana police,supra,th,d,nor the arguments of the city in the present case,provide any reasoned basis for selecting which of the special statutory provisions governing judicial proceedings conducted pursuant to the act should apply to declaratory relief actions filed by public entities pursuant to code of civil procedure section in the circumstances now before us,and which should not apply.for example,the city does not explain why the foregoing isolated provisions in the attorney fees and appellate be deemed applicable in an ordinary declaratory relief action initiated by a public agency,but other provisions of the the statute specifying that judicial proceedings conducted pursuant to the act may be commenced only by a person seeking disclosure of documents should not apply.the provision authorizing an award of attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff is limited expressly to litigation filed pursuant to section,subd.d.this provision also reflects a legislative intent that the plaintiff in a proceeding pursuant to sections and can not be the public agency from which disclosure is sought,because the provision contemplates that the public agency always will pay any costs and attorney fees should the plaintiff prevail,subd.d.the provision authorizing expedited writ review authorizes a party to file a petition for extraordinary writ upon entry of an order pursuant to section,subd.c.if these special statutory procedures nevertheless govern an ordinary declaratory relief action filed by a public agency pursuant to code of civil procedure section,as the city contends,the procedures and limitations of section also should apply.as we have seen,section limits the declaratory relief proceedings it authorizes to those initiated by persons seeking to enforce their right to inspect or to obtain disclosure of public records.
the city maintains that public agencies must be permitted to initiate declaratory relief actions to determine their rights and obligations under the act,because a public agency might deny the request of another public agency for inspection of public records,necessitating litigation to determine whether such records must be disclosed.the present case does not involve such a dispute,however,and we have no occasion to decide whether a public agency is authorized to initiate a judicial proceeding to enforce a right to inspect or to seek disclosure of public records in the possession of another public agency.
we also have no occasion in the present case to determine whether a third party possesses the right to seek a judicial ruling precluding a public agency from disclosing documents pursuant to the cpra.see.such an action,known as a reverse foia case pursuant to the federal counterpart of the cpra,has been held to be authorized by a specific federal statute authorizing judicial review of agency actions that adversely affect another person.campaign for family farms glickman cir.the united states supreme court has recognized,however,that the foia itself provides only a cause of action to compel an action to prohibit disclosure.chrysler brown,d.
amici curiae california state association of counties and league of california cities contend that a federal district court power to grant equitable relief in an foia case is not limited to granting only the remedies set forth in the foia,and that the cpra should be construed in a similar manner to authorize the type of declaratory relief sought by the city in the present case.amici curiae rely upon the high court decision in renegotiation board bannercraft clothing,d,which suggested that in a proceeding initiated by government contractors pursuant to the foia,the district court equity powers were not limited to those specified in the foia and could extend to enjoining action by a public agency.the high court considered it unnecessary to decide that issue,however,because it determined that the district court had erred in enjoining the defendant agency from engaging in contract negotiations pending the determination of the contractors foia claim.such a result,the court reasoned,would permit the contractors to use the foia to achieve a particular result in administrative proceedings through judicial interference.contrary to the contention of amici curiae,the cited decision does not provide any guidance in resolving the only issue presented a california superior court sho
