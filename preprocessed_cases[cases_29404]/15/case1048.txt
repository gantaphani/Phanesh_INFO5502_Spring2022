insurance code section requires that certain kinds of insurance may be sold only by what are known as appointed agents persons for whom the insurer has filed with the insurance commissioner a notice of appointment formally designating the person to act on the insurer behalf.a trio of related insurers which for purposes of simplicity will hereinafter be collectively referred to as mercury sold policies of automobile insurance within the state through who are not appointed agents.suit was instituted to stop this practice,as well as permitting the to charge consumers broker fees added to the advertised price of insurance.the trial court determined that both of these practices ran afoul of the unfair competition law ucl bus,et and permanently enjoined them.
the primary issue pressed by mercury is whether its practice of employing who are not appointed agents has been sanctioned by the legislature and therefore enjoys a safe harbor from liability under the ucl.although the issue is not free from all doubt,on balance it appears from the governing statutes,particularly section a,that the legislature has not created a safe harbor for this practice.we therefore affirm.
background 
the trial court findings of fact and conclusions of law are best comprehended in light of the extensive statutory history that underpins the trial court reasoning.that history involves the evolution of the concepts of broker and agent in the insurance context.
statutorily,an agent is defined as one who is authorized,by and on behalf of an insurer,to transact all classes of insurance except for life insurance,while a broker is a person who,for compensation and on behalf of another person,transacts insurance other than life with,but not on behalf of,an insurer.
one of the leading treatises explains the fundamental distinction between an agent and a broker in these terms an insurance broker is one who acts as a middleman between the insured and the insurer,soliciting insurance from the public under no employment from any special company,and,upon securing an order,placing it with a company selected by the insured or with a company selected by himself or herself whereas an insurance agent is one who represents an insurer under an employment by it.a broker is,in essence,employed in each instance as a special agent for a single purpose,while the very definition of agent indicates an ongoing and continuous relationship b rokers and insureds are ordinarily involved in what can be viewed as a series of discrete transactions,while agents and insureds tend to be under some duty to each other during the entire length of the relationship.couch on insurance.ed,fns.omitted see appleman on insurance holmes ed,croskey et,cal practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,to.in one court of appeal held that a broker is not an agent of the insurer,but is an independent contractor acting as agent for the insured.the most definitive characteristic of an insurance agent is his authority to bind his principal,the insurer an insurance broker has no such authority t he broker does not have authority to bind an insurer and the insurance company must first execute the binder or policy a broker does not execute a policy without a prior authorization from the insurer.in contrast,the agent is authorized to execute the binder himself.marsh mclennan of,city of los angeles d.
an individual can not act as an insurance agent in california without a valid license issued by the commissioner of insurance.in addition to possessing a license,an insurance agent must be authorized by an insurance carrier to transact insurance business on the carrier behalf.this authorization must be evidenced by a notice of agency appointment on file with the department of insurance,subd.a.loehr great republic ins.d.unlike an agent,a broker does not act for the insurer,and the insurer is not liable for the broker acts or omissions,kurtz,richards,wilson insurance communicators marketing th,d reid northern assur.because a broker,unlike an appointed agent,does not have the insurer available as a source of compensation for aggrieved insureds,the broker is required to post a bond before being allowed to operate.
nevertheless,there is no absolute dichotomy between agents and brokers.in,in a noninsurance context,our supreme court recognized that a person could be the agent of both parties to a commercial transaction.glenn rice cal.this principle of dual agency is well established as a general principle of agency law.see rest d agency.in january of,a court of appeal applied it for the first time to the insurance context.in maloney rhode island ins.d,it was held that a broker acting for the insured could also act as the agent of the insurer w hen the broker accepts the policy from the insurer and the premium from the assured,he has elected to act for the insurer to deliver the policy and to collect the premium.id.at.
brokers liked the result in maloney but did not want to be required to be licensed as agents as well as brokers.at their prompting,the insurance commissioner sponsored a bill that would codify the result of maloney and authorize brokers to act as the insurer agent while collecting premiums and delivering policies.see cal.ins,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.prepared for governor warren june.the bill was signed into law in july,six months after maloney was decided.stats,ch,enacting former.the basis for what is now section provided a person licensed as an insurance broker may act as an insurance agent in collecting and transmitting premium or return ing premium funds and delivering policies and other documents evidencing insurance.
here matters more or less remained until passage of proposition in.that initiative made the insurance commissioner commissioner an elected official,rolled back car insurance rates,and made rates subject to the commissioner approval.it also directed that every person who meets the statutory standards as a good driver was entitled a rate at least below the rate the insured would otherwise have been charged for the same coverage,subd.b.an insurer shall not refuse to offer and sell a good driver discount policy to any person who meets the standards,subd.b.
in the legislature added the term to section,which defines fire and casualty licensee,and to section.stats,ch.the same bill amended section a to provide in pertinent part every applicant for a license as a life agent,a fire and casualty to act as an insurance agent,or a travel insurance agent shall have filed on his or her behalf with the commissioner a notice of appointment to act as an agent executed by an insurer appointing the applicant,upon licensing,its agent within this state stats,ch.
five years later was added to the statute governing the termination of a broker or agent operating pursuant to a written contract,as amended by stats,ch.applicable to a written agency or written brokerage contract where the represents the insurer,the amended statute specified that advance notice of termination was not required if the exceeded his or her binding authority under the agency or brokerage contract,subds.a,b.
in january of,the commissioner sent mercury a draft notice of noncompliance.the gist of the notice was much the same as this mercury was employing brokers who are operating as de facto agents but who were being advertised by mercury as independent.the notice was discussed at a meeting later that month between mercury and representatives of the department of insurance.mercury took the position that statutes and court decisions do not clearly define the difference between agents and brokers.one of the commissioner representatives proposed that mercury draft a bill that defines agents and brokers for submission to the legislature.mercury did so,but the commissioner opposed the bill on the ground that it would blur the legal distinctions between agents and brokers and would create confusion for the consumer the legislature passed the bill and the governor signed it.it amended section,which then provided an insurance broker is a person who,for compensation and on behalf of another person,transacts insurance other than life with,but not on behalf of,an insurer.the mercury bill added the following language every application for insurance submitted by an insurance broker to an insurer shall show that the person is acting as an insurance broker.if the application shows that the person is acting as an insurance broker and is licensed as an insurance broker in the state in which the application is submitted,it shall be presumed,for licensing purposes only,that the person is acting as an insurance broker.nothing in this section is intended to affect any rights or remedies otherwise available under the law.stats,ch.
in,the legislature enacted a number of statutes dealing with the scope of a personal lines licensee.a person holding such a license is authorized to transact automobile insurance,including insurance for recreational vehicles used for noncommercial purposes,personal watercraft insurance,residential property insurance including earthquake and flood insurance,inland marine insurance covering personal property,and umbrella or excess liability insurance providing coverage when written over one or more underlying automobile or residential property insurance policies a personal lines is given the same authorization,subd.a.a fire and casualty licensee is defined as a person authorized to act as an insurance agent,broker or solicitor,and a fire and casualty and authorized to transact care coverage and any coverage that a personal lines licensee is authorized to transact see stats,ch,stats,ch.
finally,in,the legislature again amended section a to provide in pertinent part life agents,travel agents,and fire and casualty insurance agents shall not act as an agent of an insurer unless the insurer has filed with the commissioner a notice of appointment,executed by the insurer,appointing the licensee as the insurer agent stats,ch.
this litigation commenced when plaintiff robert krumme filed a complaint on behalf of the general public.plaintiff stated he was challenging the practices of the defendant insurance companies in selling automobile and other personal lines insurance policies through insurance producers denominated as brokers who in fact act as defendants agents,but who nevertheless charge consumers brokers fees.the broker fees are made part are charged in addition rates and premiums for defendants products that were previously approved pursuant to proposition defendants do not disclose the broker fees to the department of insurance,and the broker fees have not been reviewed or approved as required by law.the relief sought by plaintiff was a judgment commanding restitution and disgorgement of monies and benefits taken illegally and for injunctive relief to stop these business practices.
at the conclusion of a bench trial,the trial court issued pages of findings of fact and conclusions of law.although mercury states in its opening brief that many of the findings are either unsupported by the evidence or are otherwise flawed,it chooses to forgo challenging them because it sees issues of trial court erroneous conclusions of law in its application of sufficient to require reversal of the injunction.in light of this approach,we presume the findings are supported by substantial evidence and summarize the relevant facts as set forth in the findings.see state farm mutual automobile ins.quackenbush th,d.
until,mercury only sold insurance through approximately appointed agents.beginning in,mercury terminated the appointments of approximately of those agents and made them brokers.in general,the change in title did not alter the ability or authority to bind mercury,but it did allow the former agents to charge brokerage fees.policies sold by brokers or appointed agents used the same application forms,rating guidelines,and underwriting guidelines,all of which were provided by mercury.both brokers and appointed agents advertise that they represent mercury.mercury subjects agents and brokers to the same amount of training and supervision.mercury does not object to brokers charging brokerage fees in addition to policy premiums,but it will discipline appointed agents who attempt to charge such fees.in its comparative rate advertising,mercury does not advise that brokerage fees may be added to the advertised cost of insurance.this practice may provide a competitive advantage to mercury,which is aware of,and concerned about,misleading the public with its comparative rate print advertisements,but it has not established any system to discover or monitor and has no way of knowing whether brokerage fees are being assessed.mercury submits its insurance rates and not the brokerage the california department of insurance for approval.
as conclusions of law,the trial court determined 
brokers and appointed agents were functionally indistinguishable in their relationship to mercury.
in view of the substance of their dealings with mercury,b ecause these brokers have transacted,and do transact,insurance on behalf of mercury,they can not be considered insurance brokers for licensing purposes within the meaning of insurance code and are instead insurance agents within the meaning of insurance code.
mercury was incorrect in maintaining that its brokers could be both an agent and a broker,the equivalent of a dual agent.rather,dual agency is permitted only in a very limited context,the authority to collect premiums and deliver policies.see insurance code the purpose of this safe harbor is to maintain the distinction while at the same time protecting insureds.it is not a device to confuse the established legal distinction between a broker and an agent so clearly announced in and of the insurance code.any other contention that the dual agency notion is a tacit override of the restrictions legislatively created by and must be discounted in light of the clear mandate articulated in these legal standards from at least july,to date,the brokers have transacted insurance on behalf of mercury outside the limited scope permitted by insurance code section.
the court construes insurance code a to require each insurance company who wishes to transact insurance in california to file action notices with the department of insurance for all fire and casualty licensees who act in the capacity as an insurance agent on the company behalf within the meaning of insurance code section.this construction is the most consistent with the language of section a,and with the statute purpose,which is to ensure that each such insurance company publicly identifies the licensees acting on its behalf as a public acknowledgement of the company liability for the errors and omissions of the licensee.by its operative language,a merges the role of only in the limited context of fire and casualty.the legislature expressly left untouched the broader statutory distinctions and regulatory effect of and in other forms of insurance policies when it amended a.
from january,to date,mercury has violated and continues to violate the letter,policy,and spirit of section a by not filing action notices for brokers selling mercury personal lines auto insurance because the brokers were and are acting in the capacity of insurance agents on mercury behalf within the meaning of insurance code section.
the court further concluded that because broker fees may be charged only by bona fide brokers,not persons and firms claiming to be brokers that are in reality appointed agents,the brokerage fees collected by mercury brokers were illegal.mercury should have filed action notices for its brokers.its failure to do so violated and violates the spirit and policy of the common law of agency.
mercury is vicariously liable under the ucl for these past and ongoing violations of the broker fee regulations and the common law by its broker agents.the brokers charged and charge these broker fees in the course and scope of transacting insurance on behalf of mercury,and therefore in the capacity of insurance agents within the meaning of section on behalf of mercury.
from at least july,mercury has engaged and continues to engage in false advertising in violation of business professions code sections and by advertising rate comparisons without disclosing that broker fees may be added in addition to the premium advertised.these advertisements were and are likely to deceive consumers because undisclosed broker fees that materially affect the cost of the insurance and adversely affect the comparison of mercury rates with those of the quoted competitors may be added at the time the consumer purchases mercury insurance.
the court rejected mercury claim that plaintiff claims are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state department of insurance none of plaintiff claims challenges any rate or premium which mercury submitted to or obtained approval from the state department of insurance or seeks to enforce any provision of insurance code section et.compare walker allstate indemnity th,d.accordingly,exclusive jurisdiction is not a defense indeed,walker recognized the continuing application of the unfair competition law as to insurers except in the area of ratemaking walker at th,d.a review of plaintiff third amended complaint discloses the allegations under focus on the relationship mercury producers have with the defendant.it alleges that the defendant has fostered this relationship without complying with of the insurance code.as a result,mercury is engaging in unfair,unlawful,and fraudulent business practices.the contentions found to be true by this court,are not anchored in rates as opposed to relationships that generate the violation of business and professions code.
it is immaterial to mercury liability in this case that it did not actually receive the broker fees.under section,the test of liability is whether mercury engaged in unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practices mercury need not directly benefit in order to be held liable under this statute.nevertheless,there is evidence in the record that even though mercury did not directly receive the fees,mercury perceives some business advantage and therefore a benefit in the charging of broker fees by its broker agents further,mercury is deemed by operation of law to have constructively received the broker fees.the issue of constructive as opposed to actual receipt is more appropriately addressed to the remedial aspect of the case.
the court thereafter entered a judgment in the form of a permanent injunction prohibiting mercury from selling any policy of personal lines automobile homeowners insurance in california through a who has not been appointed an agent pursuant to section a or through a particular who mercury knows has charged or is continuing to charge a broker fee,and publishing any advertising that compares insurance premiums for personal lines automobile homeowner policies without a conspicuous statement that a broker fee may be charged in addition to the premium quoted for the mercury insurance.thereafter the court granted plaintiff motion for attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section,and made an order awarding plaintiff.
mercury filed timely notices of appeal from the judgment and from the fee order.
both sides have the support of amici curiae on this american agents alliance for mercury,and the commissioner for plaintiff.
several matters require initial comment.
mercury makes a point of opening its brief with comments that plaintiff never purchased a policy from mercury and is therefore utterly disinterested in the controversy he began.it is well established,however,that a personal stake is not required for standing to prosecute an unfair competition lawsuit on behalf of others a private plaintiff who has himself suffered no injury at all may sue to obtain relief for others.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d.
according to mercury,the trial court conclusion that mercury constructively received illegal broker fees,while incorrect,nonetheless brings this matter within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the insurance commissioner and divests the superior court of any power to grant relief.mercury reasons that if the fees charged by its brokers are part of the premium charged customers,the matter comes within the commissioner plenary authority over rates and premiums.we do not see the trial court actions as trespassing upon the commissioner jurisdiction.
the elaborate statutory and administrative process for setting rates has been interpreted to provide exclusive original jurisdiction over issues related to ratemaking to the commissioner.walker allstate indemnity,supra,th,d.the insurance code does not,however,displace the ucl except as to activities related to rate setting.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d,see walker allstate indemnity,supra,at,d.what a court held with respect to a federal statute forbidding local action that would regulate the rates charged by a federally regulated industry is equally valid to the insurance context a judicial act constitutes rate regulation only if its principal purpose and direct effect are to control rates in general,a claim that directly challenges a rate and seeks a remedy to limit or control the rate prospectively or retrospectively is an attempt to regulate rates,but a claim that directly challenges some other activity,such as false advertising is not rate regulation.spielholz superior court th,d,italics added.a claim predicated on a violation of the insurance code not related to ratemaking may thus be framed as a claim under the ucl.see donabedian mercury ins.th,d.this was the approach plaintiff adopted.mercury was allegedly violating provisions of the insurance code regulating brokers,as well as engaging in false advertising.there is consequently no basis for overturning the trial court conclusion that n one of plaintiff claims challenges any rate or premium which mercury submitted to or obtained approval from the department of insurance.
our confidence in this determination is enhanced by the fact that the commissioner,appearing as amicus curiae,does not agree with mercury,but has filed a brief supporting plaintiff.the fact that the commissioner does not view the trial court as having poached into the commissioner statutory domain is clearly significant,and we defer to his interpretation of his authority,henning industrial welfare com.cal d,pacific legal foundation unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d,personal watercraft coalition marin county bd.of supervisors th,d spanish speaking citizens foundation,low th,d.
after briefing was completed,mercury sent a letter advising us of the recent decision in jonathan neil,jones cal th,d,wherein our supreme court discussed the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.mercury states in its letter that this discussion is relevant to the present appeal because mercury has argued,both in the trial court and in its appellate briefs,that this case should not have been adjudicated in the superior court,but should have been referred to the insurance commissioner.plaintiff and mercury then submitted letter briefs on this issue.
unlike exclusive jurisdiction,primary jurisdiction is not jurisdictional in the sense that courts are utterly without the power to decide,but is a common law policy advancing comity between courts and administrative agencies.primary jurisdiction,applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts,and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which,under a regulatory scheme,have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d,italics omitted see also common cause board of supervisors cal d,fn.t he primary jurisdiction doctrine advances two related policies it enhances court decisionmaking and efficiency by allowing courts to take advantage of administrative expertise,and it helps assure uniform application of regulatory laws.citations.no rigid formula exists for applying the primary jurisdiction doctrine citation.instead,resolution generally hinges on a court determination of the extent to which the policies noted above are implicated in a given case.citations.this discretionary approach leaves courts with considerable flexibility to avoid application of the doctrine in appropriate situations,as required by the interests of justice.farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,at,d.
mercury invoked the doctrine of primary jurisdiction before the trial court.mercury did not,however,claim in its opening brief that the trial court decision not to stay judicial proceedings was an abuse of discretion.mercury did not mention the issue of the commissioner having primary jurisdiction until it filed its reply brief.thus,the issue could be treated as waived,kahn wilson cal,reichardt hoffman th,d witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
assuming the issue was preserved,we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to refer the matter to the commissioner.first,there is a basis for believing the commissioner would not have accepted the referral.in july of,when he adopted regulations concerning broker fees see,tit,the commissioner took the position that current california case law establishes that the existence of binding authority creates an agency relationship between insurer and producer.marsh mclennan of california city of los angeles supra,d.the issue of what factors,such as binding authority,do or do not establish an agency relationship are better addressed by the legislature and the courts.the commissioner arguably lacks a legislative delegation to resolve this issue through regulations.ins,final statement of reasons,tit,et,file no.july,italics added.second,as plaintiff attorney stated in his letter responding to mercury letter t he commissioner has now made his views known to the courts through his amicus curiae brief,stating that he agrees with the findings and conclusions of the superior court,with one minor immaterial exception.the amicus curiae brief establishes that even if mercury had sought a stay based on primary jurisdiction,which of course it did not,there was no error or prejudice to mercury from the superior court not having the views of the department of insurance before its decision on the merits.again,the commissioner silence is eloquent evidence of his belief that he had no administrative expertise to offer the court in resolving the issues generated by this litigation.personal watercraft coalition marin county bd.of supervisors,supra,th,d spanish speaking citizens foundation,low,supra,th,d.for each and all of these reasons,the commissioner primary jurisdiction was not an impediment to the trial court proceeding to adjudicate the issues before it.
mercury principal contention is that the dual agency practiced by mercury and its independent brokers can not form the basis of ucl liability because it falls within a statutory and regulatory safe harbor.mercury is invoking an exception to the ucl that our supreme court explained as follows although the unfair competition law scope is sweeping,it is not unlimited.courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair.specific legislation may limit the judiciary power to declare conduct unfair.if the legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.when specific legislation provides a safe harbor,plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.however,the court added a caution acts that the legislature has determined to be lawful may not form the basis for an action under the unfair competition law,but acts may,if otherwise unfair,be challenged under the unfair competition law even if the legislature failed to proscribe them in some other provision.id.at,d.
mercury marshals a number of arguments as to why its practices with brokers are proper and should not have been enjoined.
proposition altered the way insurance products were delivered to consumers.with all underwriting decisions made in advance under the watchful eyes of the insurance commissioner,personal lines insurance became more of a commodity,and the functions of the insurance producer became limited primarily to customer service.if an applicant is a good driver,satisfies the insurer guidelines,and pays the initial premium,the insurer must automatically accept the risk.the generic nature of this transaction reduced the significance of any distinction between the functions of agents and brokers.due to mandatory insurance laws the marketplace also demanded that all insurance producers have the ability to provide immediate insurance coverage to every qualified applicant.without that ability,producers could not satisfy the needs of car purchasers unable to drive their cars off the lot without insurance.the realities of the changed market are reflected in the amendments to the insurance code provisions relating to brokers and agents,which progressively vested brokers with all authority traditionally associated with agents.to the extent that the definitional provisions of the insurance code had operational significance,before that significance was eliminated.mercury points to the amendments to sections and see fn.and accompanying text,ante as having drained the definitional language of sections and of their operating significance and further codified the dual agency doctrine,reflecting legislative recognition,in the wake of proposition,that brokers were simultaneously performing agency functions beyond those heretofore specifically listed in insurance code section incorporating the licensee into its statement of dual agency.mercury concludes that the codification of dual agency in section,together with the broker authority to transact insurance conferred by section section,creates an express safe harbor for mercury practices that precludes ucl liability.
plaintiff responds that section a should not be accorded the toothless interpretation that insurance companies may simply forego appointment with impunity,but should be construed to impose an affirmative duty on insurers to file appointment notices for any licensee acting as an insurer agent.plaintiff urges us to adopt this test if the licensee acts as an agent for the insurer in any capacity,except as expressly allowed by section,the licensee is an agent and must be appointed.the commissioner takes essentially the same view i f a producer acts on behalf of an insurer in any way except as permitted by section,then he or she ceases to be a broker,even if the producer mainly acts for the insured.the plain meaning of sections and is that a producer is an agent if the producer acts on behalf of an insurer in any way not permitted by section.if this argument does not succeed,plaintiff alternative position is that the judgment may be affirmed because the trial court findings of fact support the conclusion that the brokers were mercury de facto agents and therefore subject to the appointment requirement of section a.
neither of these arguments is completely persuasive,in large part because each suffers from a common defect.each selectively emphasizes favorable statutory language in isolation without attempting to fit the language into a coherent reading of all of the statutes in the insurance code dealing with the issue.mercury depicts a remorseless march of history away from mutually exclusive concepts of agent and broker,but does not account for the legislature refusal to stop using these terms in new statutes.plaintiff fears that if mercury prevails,section a will become a dead letter because no insurer will bother to appoint agents,but deal only with brokers for whom the insurer will not be vicariously liable.as a court,however,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.people pieters cal d.
mercury does not establish,as a matter of law that the legislature expressly created a safe harbor for the practices enjoined by the trial court.true,the legislature did,following maloney,enact what is now section to codify acceptance of the concept of dual agency in the insurance field,and in that sense did create an express statutory safe harbor.it did so,however,in a very precise way,going no further than the maloney broker could act as an insurer agent,but only to the extent of collecting and transmitting premium or return ing premium funds and delivering policies and other documents evidencing insurance.despite numerous opportunities to do so,the legislature has never expanded this definition in section.
the addition of to section defining fire and casualty licensee,and to section broker see fn,ante does not,at first glance,assist mercury because neither of these changes suggests that by adding the new term the legislature intended to make any fundamental alteration of the established distinction between agent and broker.indeed,the amendment of section in the same bill would seem to have been premised on maintaining that distinction by addressing the situation where a person licensed as a fire and casualty who is acting as an insurance broker may act as an insurance agent in collecting and transmitting premium or return ing premium funds and delivering policies and other documents evidencing insurance.italics added.if,as mercury argues,the legislature intended to drain the definitional language of sections and of their operating significance,this would have been a very oblique way of achieving that goal a far more logical approach would have been to have amended or repealed the statutes defining agent and broker.elbert,gross cal d,had the legislature intended to create an exception to the statute of limitations,the more logical place to do so would have been in section,rather than in section,of the act.
the legislative history establishes that the legislature did indeed intend to amalgamate the categories of broker and agent,at least with respect to personal lines.the legislative counsel digest for the bill states this bill would eliminate insurance agent and insurance broker as categories of licensure,and would instead provide for licensure of fire and casualty insurance under the bill,fire and casualty could be authorized to act as brokers or agents.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.stats,summary.there are numerous committee reports and analyses that made the same point.com.on insurance,claims and corporations,on bill reg.sess.as amended,sb does the following combines existing licenses property and casualty sales licenses solicitor,agent broker into a license rules,on bill reg.sess.as amended may,bill would combine property and casualty sales licenses solicitor,agent and broker into a license assem.com.on finance and insurance,analysis of bill reg.sess.july,this bill combines the property casualty licenses into a single license,called the fire and casualty license assem.com.on ways and means,analysis of bill reg.sess,this bill makes several changes related to the licensure categories,including combining agent and broker license categories.
thus,there is some basis for mercury to maintain that the changes enacted by the bill drained the definitional language of sections and of their operating significance and further codified the dual agency doctrine,but only as to personal lines handled by a fire and casualty.of greater consequence is the fact that the same bill that inserted into sections and also amended section a to read in pertinent part every applicant for a license as a fire and casualty to act as an insurance agent shall have filed on his or her behalf with the commissioner a notice of appointment to act as an agent executed by an insurer,appointing the applicant its agent within this state.stats,ch.further statutory recognition is found in the subsequent changes to section addressing the grounds for terminating the written contract of a with an insurer,and the addition of section authorizing a personal lines agent to become a fire and casualty.each of these statutes must be considered in light of the others,and harmonized with them 
for mercury,the legislature,by introducing the term into a number of statutes principally sections,and,and yet not defining that term,means that the only definition can come from the statutes defining broker and agent.according to this reasoning,can now exercise the powers of brokers and agents that are spelled out in sections and,respectively,without being subjected to the limitations laid out in those same statutes.if this approach were to be accepted,personal lines would in effect be free to exercise all of the powers authorized by those statutes.the limitations imposed by sections and would in essence be cancelled and,as applied to personal lines,the statutes would become dead letters.we are not persuaded.
section a was the linchpin of the trial court decision.the version clearly stated that an applicant for a license as a fire and casualty to act as an insurance agent must be appointed.the version,however,changed fire and casualty to fire and casualty insurance agents.upon examination,however,both versions of section a support the judgment entered by the trial court.
the first version was enacted by the same bill whereby the legislature added the term to sections and,the same bill mercury maintains homogenized the former categories of broker and agent into the new single category of.this was only one year after mercury began converting its agents to brokers.thus,for more than a decade mercury was not complying with the plain command of section a as it then read,that e very applicant for a license as a fire and casualty to act as an insurance agent shall be appointed.
the amendment changed the reference from to agent.the legislative history provides no clear reason why this particular change was made.the history demonstrates that the major intention of the bill,which amended,repealed,and added numerous provisions to the insurance code,was to avoid federal regulation in the areas of federally chartered depository institutions and reciprocal multistate licensing of producers there is nothing showing why this precise change was made,and no expressed intent to relieving personal lines of the appointment requirement because the legislative history is completely silent,there is no reasonable basis for concluding that the legislature intended that people writing fire and casualty insurance on behalf of insurers,whether called or agents,should be exempt from the appointment requirement.see people barker cal th,d.certainly,there is no basis for believing that mercury was anticipating this change,or relying upon it,when it began converting its appointed agents to brokers in.
to be sure,mercury has presented a convincing argument that the traditional distinction between broker and agent has receded.but it does not follow that are exempt from the appointment requirement of section a.reading all the statutes together and in light of each other see international business machines state bd.of equalization,supra,cal d,quoted at fn,ante it appears that in this area the terms have become interchangeable.brokers can exercise the traditional functions of agents,and vice versa.having already enacted in the version of section a that every must be appointed,and there being no indication that the legislature meant to relax this requirement,the amendment of section a can be read as simply a reformulation of the appointment requirement.what had been explicit in the version was now implicit agent was now used as shorthand for.another provision of section demonstrates this point.
the version did not amend that portion of section a which provides that a notice of appointment will remain valid until t he filing of a notice of termination by the insurer or by the appointed fire and casualty,subd.a.if the commissioner must be notified that a appointment for an insurer is terminated,it logically follows that the commissioner must be notified when the is first appointed by an insurer,noted by the trial which insurer.there would be no point to the legislature not requiring to be appointed,but then in the same statute specifying the circumstances when that nonexistent appointment would end.statutorily,is therefore the same as agent for purposes of section a.
notwithstanding the change to section a,there are a number of other statutes showing that a fire and casualty is still treated as an agent and is therefore subject to the appointment re
