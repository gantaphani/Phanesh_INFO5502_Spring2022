regulation z promulgated by the federal reserve board board pursuant to its authority under the truth in lending act requires credit card issuers to disclose certain information to cardholders.the version of the regulation in effect at the time this dispute arose obliges issuers to provide to cardholders an i nitial disclosure statement,cfr,specifying each periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge,a.it also imposes s ubsequent disclosure requirements,including notice to cardholders w henever any term required to be disclosed under is changed,c.when a periodic rate or other finance charge is increased because of the consumer delinquency or default,notice must be given before the effective date of the change.ibid.
at the time respondent mccoy filed suit,he was the holder of a credit card issued by petitioner chase bank.the cardholder agreement provided,in relevant part,that mccoy was eligible for preferred rates as long as he met certain conditions.if any of those conditions were not met,chase reserved the right to raise the rate,up to a maximum,and to apply the change to both existing and new balances.mccoy alleges that chase increased his interest rate due to his delinquency or default and applied that increase retroactively,and that this action violated regulation z because chase did not notify him of the increase until after it had taken effect.the district court dismissed his complaint,holding that because the increase did not constitute a change in terms under c,chase was not required to notify him of the increase before implementing it.the ninth circuit reversed in relevant part,holding that regulation z requires issuers to provide notice of an increase prior to its effective date.
held at the time of the transactions at issue,regulation z did not require chase to provide mccoy with a notice before implementing the agreement term allowing it to raise his interest rate,up to a maximum,following delinquency or default.
a this case requires the court to determine the meaning of a regulation promulgated by the board under its statutory authority.however,regulation z text is unclear with respect to the crucial interpretive question at issue whether a change to an interest rate,pursuant to contractual provision,constitutes a change to a term required to be disclosed under requiring a subsequent disclosure under c.because of this ambiguity,the court must look to the board own interpretation of the regulation for guidance in deciding this case.
b the board has made clear in its amicus brief to this court that,in its view,chase was not required to give mccoy notice of the interest rate increase under the applicable version of regulation z.this court defers to an agency interpretation of its own regulation,advanced in a legal brief,unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,internal quotation marks omitted.in auer,the court deferred to the secretary of labor interpretation of his own regulation,presented in an amicus brief submitted by the agency at the court invitation.the court held that the fact that the interpretation came in a legal brief did not,in the circumstances of th at case,make it unworthy of deference.at.the interpretation was in no sense a post hoc rationalization advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency action against attack,ibid.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted,and there was no reason to suspect that the interpretation did not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question,ibid.the brief submitted by the board here,at the court invitation,is no different.as in auer,there is no reason to believe that the board interpretation is a post hoc rationalization taken as a litigation position,for the board is not a party to this case.and its interpretation is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the indeterminate text of regulation thus,there is no reason to suspect that the board position in its amicus brief reflects anything other than its fair and considered judgment as to what the regulation required at the time this dispute arose.that congress and the board may currently hold a different view does not mean that deference is not warranted to the board understanding of what the applicable version of regulation z required.under auer,therefore,it is clear that deference to the interpretation in the agency amicus brief is warranted.
c mccoy errs in arguing that deference to a legal brief is inappropriate because the interpretation of regulation z in the official staff commentary commands a different result.while commentary promulgated by the board as an interpretation of regulation z may warrant deference as a general matter,the commentary explaining the requirements at issue in this case largely replicates the ambiguity present in the regulatory text,and therefore offers no reason to disregard the interpretation advanced in the board amicus brief.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
as applicable to this case,regulation z promulgated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system board pursuant to its authority under the truth in lending act tila,stat,et requires that issuers of credit cards provide cardholders with an i nitial disclosure statement specifying,inter alia,each periodic rate associated with the account.cfr a.the regulation also imposes s ubsequent disclosure requirements,including notice to cardholders w henever any term required to be disclosed under is changed.c.this case presents the question whether regulation z requires an issuer to notify a cardholder of an increase instituted pursuant to a provision of the cardholder agreement giving the issuer discretion to increase the rate,up to a stated maximum,in the event of the cardholder delinquency or default.we conclude that the version of regulation z applicable in this case does not require such notice.
congress passed tila to promote consumers informed use of credit by requiring meaningful disclosure of credit terms,a,and granted the board the authority to issue regulations to achieve tila purposes,a.pursuant to this authority,the board promulgated regulation z,which requires credit card issuers to disclose certain information to consumers two provisions of regulation z are at issue in this case.the first,cfr,explains what information credit card issuers are obliged to provide to cardholders in the i nitial disclosure statement,including each periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge.a.the second,imposes upon issuers certain s ubsequent disclosure requirements,including a requirement to provide notice w henever any term required to be disclosed under is changed.c.as a general matter,notice of a change in terms has to be provided days in advance of the effective date of the change.ibid.when a periodic rate or other finance charge is increased because of the consumer delinquency or default,however,notice only need be given before the effective date of the change.ibid.regulation z also explains that no notice is required under when the change in terms results from the consumer default or delinquency other than an increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge.c.
the official interpretation of regulation z official staff commentary or commentary promulgated by the board explains these requirements further section c requirement does not apply if the specific change is set forth initially,such as an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in order to keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the specified minimum.cfr pt,supp.i,comment c,hereinafter comment c.on the other hand,the commentary explains,notice must be given if the contract allows the creditor to increase the rate at its discretion but does not include specific terms for an increase for example,when an increase may occur under the creditor contract reservation right to increase the periodic rate.ibid.as to the timing requirements,the commentary states a notice of change in terms is required,but it may be mailed or delivered as late as the effective date of the change i f there is an increased periodic rate or any other finance charge attributable to the consumer delinquency or default.comment c,at hereinafter comment c.
at least as early as,the board began considering revisions to regulation z.the new regulations the board eventually issued do not apply to the present case,but the details of their promulgation provides useful background in considering the parties arguments with respect to the version of regulation z we address here.in the board issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking announcing its intent to consider revisions.fed.reg.in so doing,the board described how it understood the notice requirements to function at that time 
a dvance notice is not required in all cases.for example,if the interest rate or other finance charge increases due to a consumer default or delinquency,notice is required,but need not be given in advance.cfr c comment c.and no notice is required if the creditor specifies in advance the circumstances under which an increase to the finance charge or an annual fee will occur.comment c.for example,some credit card account agreements permit the card issuer to increase the interest rate if the consumer pays late.under regulation z,because the circumstances are specified in advance in the account agreement,the creditor need not provide a notice days in advance of the increase the new rate will appear on the periodic statement for the cycle in which the increase occurs.at.
the board asked for public comment on whether these existing disclosure rules were adequate to enable consumers to make timely decisions about how to manage their accounts.at.
subsequently,in,the board published proposed amendments to regulation z and the commentary.fed.reg.one amendment would have required days advance written notice when i a rate is increased due to the consumer delinquency or default or ii a rate is increased as a penalty for one or more events specified in the account agreement,such as making a late payment or obtaining an extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit.at proposed cfr g.the board explained that,under the amendments,creditors would no longer be permitted to provide for the immediate application of penalty pricing upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the contract.fed.reg.
in january,the board promulgated a final rule implementing many of the proposed changes,scheduled to be effective july.fed.reg.most saliently,the board included a new provision,g,which requires days advance notice of increases in rates due to cardholder delinquency or default,or as a penalty,including penalties for events specified in the account agreement,such as making a late payment.cfr g.in may,congress enacted the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act credit card act or act,stat.the act amended tila,in relevant part,to require days advance notice of most increases in credit card annual percentage rates.i,supp.iii.because the credit card act notice requirements with respect to increases largely mirror the requirements in the new version of the regulation,the board changed the effective date of those requirements to august,to coincide with the statutory schedule.see fed.reg.the transactions giving rise to the dispute at issue in this case,however,arose prior to enactment of the act and the promulgation of the new regulatory provisions.
respondent james mccoy brought this action in the superior court of orange county,california on behalf of himself and others similarly situated against petitioner chase bank usa,chase removed the action to the united states district court for the central district of california under.at the time of the transactions at issue,mccoy was the holder of a credit card issued by chase.the cardholder agreement between the parties agreement provides,in relevant part,that mccoy is eligible for preferred rates,but that to keep such rates he has to meet certain conditions,including making at least the required minimum payments when due on his account and on all other loans or accounts with chase and his other creditors.brief for respondent,see also,cudahy,dissenting.if any of the conditions in the agreement are not met,chase reserves the right to change mccoy interest rate and impose a rate up to the maximum rate described in the pricing schedule and to apply any changes to existing as well as new balances effective with the billing cycle ending on the review date.brief for respondent.
mccoy complaint alleges that chase increased his interest rate due to his delinquency or default,and applied that increase retroactively.mccoy asserts that the rate increase violates regulation z because,pursuant to the agreement,chase did not notify him of the increase until after it had taken effect the district court dismissed mccoy complaint,holding that because the increase did not constitute a change in terms as contemplated by c,chase was not required to notify him of the increase before implementing it.see app.to pet.for cert.
a divided panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed in relevant part,holding that regulation z requires issuers to provide notice of an increase prior to its effective date.see,at.concluding that the text of regulation z is ambiguous and that the agency commentary accompanying the request for comments and the proposed amendments favors neither party interpretation,the court relied primarily on the official staff commentary in particular,the court noted that comment c requires no notice of a change in terms if the specific change at issue is set forth in the initial agreement.see,at.the court found,however,that because the agreement vests chase with discretion to impose any rate it chooses up to the specified maximum upon mccoy default,the agreement provides mccoy with no basis for predicting in advance what retroactive interest rate chase will choose to charge him if he defaults.at.accordingly,the court held that because the agreement does not alert mccoy to the specific change that will occur if he defaults,chase was obliged to give notice of that change prior to its effective date.ibid.relying primarily on the notice of proposed rulemaking and the proposed amendments,the dissenting judge concluded that regulation z does not require notice of an increase in the circumstances of this case.see,at opinion of cudahy.
after the ninth circuit ruling,the united states court of appeals for the first circuit decided the same question in chase favor.see shaner chase bank usa.the first circuit relied in part on an amicus brief submitted by the board at the court request,in which the agency advanced the same interpretation of regulation z that it now does before this court,at.we granted certiorari to resolve this division in authority.
in order to decide this case,we must determine whether an increase constitutes a change in terms under regulation z,when the change is made pursuant to a provision in the cardholder agreement allowing the issuer to increase the rate,up to a stated maximum,in the event of the cardholder delinquency or default.accordingly,this case calls upon us to determine the meaning of a regulation promulgated by the board under its statutory authority.the parties dispute the proper interpretation of the regulation itself,as well as whether we should accord deference to the board interpretation of its regulation.as explained below,we conclude that the text of the regulation is ambiguous,and that deference is warranted to the interpretation of that text advanced by the board in its amicus brief.
our analysis begins with the text of regulation z in effect at the time this dispute arose.first,requires an i nitial disclosure statement 
the creditor shall disclose to the consumer,in terminology consistent with that to be used on the periodic statement,each of the following items,to the extent applicable a finance charge.the circumstances under which a finance charge will be imposed and an explanation of how it will be determined,as follows 
a disclosure of each periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge,the range of balances to which it is applicable,and the corresponding annual percentage rate.when different periodic rates apply to different types of transactions,the types of transactions to which the periodic rates apply shall also be disclosed.footnotes omitted.
second,c requires certain s ubsequent disclosure requirements 
change in terms written notice required.whenever any term required to be disclosed under is changed or the required minimum periodic payment is increased,the creditor shall mail or deliver written notice of the change to each consumer who may be affected.the notice shall be mailed or delivered at least days prior to the effective date of the change.the timing requirement does not apply if the change has been agreed to by the consumer,or if a periodic rate or other finance charge is increased because of the consumer delinquency or default the notice shall be given,however,before the effective date of the change.notice not required.no notice under this section is required when the change results from the consumer default or delinquency other than an increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge.
the question is whether the increase in mccoy interest rate constitutes a change to a term required to be disclosed under,requiring a subsequent disclosure under c.one of the initial terms that must be disclosed under is each periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge and the corresponding annual percentage rate.a.mccoy argues that,because an increase in the interest rate increases the periodic rate applicable to his account,such an increase constitutes a change in terms within the meaning of c.as further support,mccoy points to two provisions in c first,that notice of an increase in the interest rate must be provided before the effective date of the change when the increase is due to the consumer delinquency or default,c and second,that no notice is required of a change resulting from the consumer default or delinquency other than an increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge,c.accordingly,because c includes increases due to delinquency or default,mccoy argues that the plain text of the regulation indicates that a change in the periodic rate due to such default is a change in terms requiring notice under c.
we recognize that mccoy argument has some force read in isolation,the language quoted above certainly suggests that credit card issuers must provide notice of an increase imposed pursuant to cardholder delinquency or default.but mccoy analysis begs the key question whether the increase actually changed a term of the agreement that was required to be disclosed under.if not,c subsequent notice requirement with respect to a change in terms does not apply.chase argues precisely this the increase did not change a term in the agreement,but merely implemented one that had been initially disclosed,as required.this interpretation,though not commanded by the text of the regulation,is reasonable.section a requires initial disclosure of each periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge.the agreement itself discloses both the initial rate preferred rate and the maximum rate to be imposed in the event of default rate.see brief for respondent,brief for petitioner accordingly,it is plausible to understand the agreement to initially disclose each periodic rate to be applied to the account,and chase arguably did not change those rates as a result of mccoy default.instead,chase merely implemented the previously disclosed term specifying the rate 
this reading still leaves the question why c refers to increases resulting from delinquency or default if such increases do not constitute a change in terms.one reasonable explanation chase offers is that c refers to increases that were not specifically outlined in the agreement initial terms unlike those in the present agreement.for example,credit card agreements routinely include a reservation of rights provision giving the issuer discretion to change the terms of the contract,often as a means of responding to events that raise doubts about the cardholder creditworthiness.an issuer may exercise this general authority and raise the interest rate applicable to the account to address any heightened risk.see brief for petitioner.in such a case,c is best read to require that notice must be given prior to the effective date of the increase,because the unilateral increase instituted by the issuer actually changed a term the interest rate in a manner not specifically contemplated by the agreement see comment c providing that notice is required if the agreement does not include specific terms for an increase for example,when an increase may occur under the creditor contract reservation right to increase the periodic rate 
in short,regulation z is unclear with respect to the crucial interpretive question whether the increase at issue in this case constitutes a change in terms requiring notice.we need not decide which party interpretation is more persuasive,however both are plausible,and the text alone does not permit a more definitive reading.accordingly,we find regulation z to be ambiguous as to the question presented,and must therefore look to the board own interpretation of the regulation for guidance in deciding this case.see coeur alaska,southeast alaska conservation council,slip,at stating that when an agency regulations construing a statute are ambiguous we next turn to the agencies subsequent interpretation of those regulations for guidance ford motor credit milhollin,stating that when the question presented is not governed by clear expression in the regulation it is appropriate to defer to the federal reserve board and staff in determining what resolution of that issue is appropriate.
the board has made clear in the amicus brief it has submitted to this court that,in the board view,chase was not required to give mccoy notice of the interest rate increase under the version of regulation z applicable at the time.under auer robbins,we defer to an agency interpretation of its own regulation,advanced in a legal brief,unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.at internal quotation marks omitted.because the interpretation the board presents in its brief is consistent with the regulatory text,we need look no further in deciding this case 
in its brief to this court,the board explains that the ninth circuit erred in concluding that,at the time of the transactions at issue in this case,regulation z required credit card issuers to provide a notice before implementing a contractual provision.see brief for united states as amicus curiae see also ibid.stating that when a term of an agreement authorized the credit provider to increase a consumer interest rate if the consumer failed to make timely payments any resulting rate increase did not represent a change in terms,but rather the implementation of terms already set forth in the initial disclosure statement at stating that w hen a cardholder agreement identifies a contingency that triggers a rate increase,and the maximum possible rate that the issuer may charge if that contingency occurs,then no notice is required under regulation z under the principles set forth in auer,we give deference to this interpretation.
in auer we deferred to the secretary of labor interpretation of his own regulation,presented in an amicus brief submitted by the agency at our invitation,at.responding to the petitioners objection that the agency interpretation came in a legal brief,we held that this fact did not,in the circumstances of this case,make it unworthy of deference.at.we observed that t he secretary position is in no sense a post hoc rationalizatio n advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency action against attack.ibid.quoting bowen georgetown.hospital.we added there is simply no reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency f
