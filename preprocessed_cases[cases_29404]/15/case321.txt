this case involves a question of first impression in this circuit the statutory interpretation of the newly enacted homestead exemption cap,p,found in the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa.the issue is whether the homestead exemption cap applies to a homestead interest established within the period preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition despite the fact that the debtor acquired title to the property before that statutory period.the bankruptcy court answered this question in the negative,and the district court affirmed.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
factual procedural background 
on january,the appellee,sarah rogers rogers or debtor,inherited a acre tract of real property known as kelly road,forney,texas forney property.rogers was single when she inherited the forney property from her mother.subsequently,rogers married george rogers,and they purchased a acre tract of real property known as south,rockwall,texas rockwall property.rogers and her husband constructed a residence on the rockwall property and claimed it as their homestead.in january,rogers separated from her husband,moved into a mobile home on the forney property,and claimed the forney property as her homestead.on april,rogers and her husband divorced.pursuant to the divorce decree,rogers was divested of all right,title and interest in the rockwall property,and no equity from the rockwall property was into the forney property.the divorce decree awarded the forney property to rogers,but this award simply affirmed the reality that the forney property was her separate property because she inherited it from her mother before marriage.
prior to,rogers and her husband had borrowed money from the appellant,jack wallace,to embark on an ultimately unsuccessful business venture.wallace eventually sued to recover the unpaid loan balance,and on april,he obtained a judgment against both the debtor and her then,for the total principal amount of,in addition to court costs and interest.
on september,the debtor filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the debtor elected state law exemptions in accordance with the provisions of b.in her schedule c,the debtor claimed her homestead exemption on the forney property in the amount of.wallace filed a timely objection to the debtor claimed homestead exemption,arguing that p capped the debtor homestead exemption at the federal statutory amount of because the debtor acquired her homestead interest in the forney property within the period preceding the filing of her bankruptcy petition.
the bankruptcy court orally denied wallace objection at a hearing held on january,and this ruling was memorialized by written order dated february.on october,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order overruling wallace objection to the claimed homestead exemption.wallace then perfected this timely appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.we review the decision of the district court by applying the same standard to the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law as the district court applied.total minatome drilling,in re drilling,cir.the bankruptcy court findings of fact are subject to clearly erroneous review,while its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.id.
b.the debtor is entitled to her full homestead exemption.
the bankruptcy estate is comprised of all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a owen owen,d.rogers elected to exempt the forney property as her homestead under texas state law.see b see also.const.art.xvi,see also.an exemption is an interest withdrawn from the estate and hence from the creditors for the benefit of the debtor.norris thomas in re norris,cir quoting owen,at.
enacted as part of bapcpa,p limits the state law homestead exemption under certain circumstances section p prevents the debtor from exempting certain interests from the bankruptcy estate if they were acquired by the debtor during the statutory period and their aggregate value exceeds a certain dollar threshold.the statute reads,in relevant part 
a s a result of electing to exempt property under state or local law,a debtor may not exempt any amount of interest that was acquired by the debtor during the period preceding the date of the filing of the petition that exceeds in the aggregate in value or personal property that the debtor or dependent of the debtor claims as a homestead.
p d.the statute further states that any amount of such interest does not include any interest transferred from a debtor previous principal residence which was acquired prior to the beginning of such period into the debtor current principal residence,if the debtor previous and current residences are located in the same state.id.p b.
the bankruptcy court held that the term interest refers to title,and the district court held that the term interest refers to equity.
both the bankruptcy court and the district court held that rogers was entitled to her homestead exemption,but they gave different reasons for this holding.the bankruptcy court predominantly focused on construing the relationship between different phrases in p d while the district court focused on interpreting the meaning of the term interest.ultimately,the two courts interpreted the term interest differently the bankruptcy court interpreted it to mean an unquantifiable property interest,which presumably refers to title or fee ownership,and the district court interpreted it to mean some legal or equitable interest that can be quantified by a monetary figure,which presumably refers to equity.both courts reached the same conclusion regarding the applicability of p d because a homestead interest is not the equivalent of title or equity.
the bankruptcy court construed p to mean that a debtor ca exempt any amount in excess of if an interest in property was acquired by the debtor during the day period preceding the date of the filing of the petition.thus,the bankruptcy court concluded that the phrase any amount modifies the phrase that exceeds in the aggregate.in the words of the bankruptcy court,it got to be the interest that acquired,not an amount of interest.the bankruptcy court concluded that p was inapplicable because rogers acquired her property interest in the forney property in,which was outside the statutory period.
although the texas supreme court has characterized the homestead interest as a legal interest created by the texas constitution,the bankruptcy court held that this legal interest was not the type of property interest covered by p.although it did not further define the term property interest,the bankruptcy court conclusion that the phrase any amount does not modify the term interest strongly suggests that it equated acquiring a property interest with acquiring title to the property.furthermore,the only case cited by the bankruptcy court at the hearing held that the term interest refers to title,not equity.see in re blair.
based on the legislative history,the bankruptcy court concluded that the purpose of the statute was to close the mansion loophole and prevent debtors from moving to states with more generous homestead exemptions on the eve of bankruptcy in order to avail themselves of those exemptions.after observing that rogers did not move to texas in anticipation of bankruptcy and that her homestead designation of the forney property was precipitated by divorce,the bankruptcy judge overruled wallace objection and held that rogers may exempt the entirety of her homestead from the bankruptcy estate.
on appeal,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order.wallace rogers in re rogers.unlike the bankruptcy court,the district court assumed that the phrase any amount modifies the term interest,so the issue was whether the characterization of real property as a homestead qualif ies as an interest within the phrase debtor may not exempt any amount of interest.id.at.the district court held that the statutory language of p was unambiguous and that the term interest refers to some legal or equitable interest that can be quantified by a monetary figure.id.at.in support of its holding that interest refers to a quantitative measure,the district court observed that the term interest is modified by the term amount,which is a quantitative term the statute mandates that the amount of interest may not exceed in the aggregate a specified dollar amount and p b allows for transfer of any amount of interest from the debtor previous principal residence that was acquired before the statutory period.id.at.regarding this third point,the district court noted that both p and p b used the term interest,and it reasoned that only equity,which has a quantitative value,can be into a new property,not a homestead interest.id.at.
the district court observed that it is impossible to have a quantity of classification as homestead.id.the district court disagreed with the bankruptcy court analysis in in re greene,which held that p applied to a homestead interest established within the statutory period despite the fact that the debtor acquired title to the property outside that period.rogers,at.the district court criticized the greene court for ignoring statutory language indicating that the term interest refers to a quantitative measure.id.the district court cited approvingly to the bankruptcy court analysis in in re rasmussen,which held that the term interest referred to equity in the property,not an ownership interest equivalent to a fee simple.rogers,at.the district court refused to consider the legislative history of p because it concluded that the statute was unambiguous,and it declined to address the meaning of the term acquired because its interpretation of the term interest was dispositive of the appeal.id.thus,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court,holding that the term interest does not encompass the classification of real property as a homestead.id.
three other bankruptcy courts have addressed this same legal issue.
two bankruptcy courts have held that p does not apply to a homestead interest established within the period if the debtor acquired title the property before that period.see in re lyons,see also venn reinhard in re reinhard.one bankruptcy court has held to the contrary.see in re greene,
in lyons,the debtor purchased the property on april,and recorded a homestead declaration on august.at.two weeks after the debtor recorded the homestead designation,a creditor was granted an attachment on the property in the amount of.id.regarding the applicability of p d,the lyons court held the following 
the plain language of section p indicates that the debtor must have acquired an interest in the property within days of filing.the term interest refers to some quantitative amount of legal or equitable value.see in re rogers,discussing at length the statutory construction of section p.the homestead is not a quantifiable interest it is a classification of property under state law.id.here,the debtor did not acquire his interest in the property within days rather,the property acquired its classification as a homestead during that time.thus,the court finds that section p d do es not apply and that debtor is entitled to the homestead exemption under massachusetts law.
at.thus,the lyons court adopted the reasoning of the district court in this case.
in reinhard,the debtor and his wife the reinhards acquired title to a florida property the seaside property on february.at.however,they resided in a different florida property the tallahassee property until june.id.during the period before they filed for bankruptcy,the reinhards moved into the seaside property and designated it as their homestead under florida law.id.no equity was transferred from the tallahassee property to the seaside property.id.the reinhards filed for bankruptcy on november.id.according to the reinhard court,the issue was whether the debtor acquired any amount of interest in value in the seaside property when it acquired homestead status under florida law.id.
the reinhard court asserted that the acquisition of an interest in property and the acquisition of homestead status are distinct concepts because homestead status attaches to protect the property after it is acquired by the debtor.id.at.the reinhard court stated the following 
homestead is simply a status,constitutionally defined,which exempts certain property from execution and limits its alienability.it is not a property interest.when a florida resident property acquires homestead status,the owner does not acquire any of the rights traditionally associated with property interests the right to possession,the right to use,the right to owner already holds whatever of these he has.accordingly,homestead status in florida is not properly conceptualized as a stick in the bundle rather,it is a protective safe in which the bundle is put.
id.thus,the reinhard court concurred with the conclusion of rogers and lyons that a homestead is a classification of property,not a property interest that implicates p.
relying in part on the district court opinion in this case,the reinhard court held that the term interest refers to a quantitative or monetary value in property.id.at.the reinhard court further elaborated on this concept when it stated that the debtor must acquire some amount of interest in the value of one of the four types of property listed during the period in order for the cap to apply.id.according to the reinhard court,p refers to the acquisition of monetary value in property,not in an exemption.id.the debtor does not acquire additional monetary value in the property when she designates it as her homestead rather,the designation merely protects the existing monetary value that the debtor acquired in the property before filing for bankruptcy.see id.at homestead status simply exempts the homesteader existing share in the property from forced sale and limits its alienability.therefore,the debtor did not acquire any amount of interest in value in the seaside property when it acquired homestead status.
to date,only one bankruptcy court has reached a conclusion contrary to that of rogers,lyons,and reinhard.in greene,the debtor purchased a parcel of undeveloped land the sparks property in may.at.the debtor admitted that he lived with his girlfriend at another location until early august.id.on august,the debtor moved a travel trailer onto the property,and on august,the debtor designated the property and the travel trailer as his homestead.id.the debtor filed his chapter petition just days later,on august.id.after the debtor voluntarily dismissed his chapter petition,the debtor filed his chapter petition on october.id.a creditor filed a timely objection to the debtor claimed homestead exemption,arguing that the exempted amount must be reduced from to pursuant to p because the homestead was an interest acquired within days of the filing of the petition id.
in greene,the debtor argued that p does not apply because he purchased the property more than days before he filed the petition.id.at.in rejecting this argument,the greene court stated that the homestead exemption is a property interest that lies dormant and inactive until it is acquired by the debtor.id.at.in the words of the greene court,w hat must be acquired during the day period is the homestead exemption,not the real property.these are separate interests.id.at.although the greene court recognized that the debtor interest in the property includes title to the property,it insisted that the term interest refers to a broader concept.see id.at whatever debtor had in his bundle of rights and interests pertaining to the property,homestead protection was not one of them.thus,the greene court concluded that the debtor homestead interest is a property interest acquired within days of his bankruptcy petition and is limited to pursuant to section p.id.
other courts have addressed the meaning of the term interest in cases involving different facts.
for purposes of p,other courts have generally defined interest as either or equity those courts adopting the equity definition have been forced to address complex issues regarding passive and active equity appreciation during the period.see in re rasmussen,at distinguishing between active equity appreciation,which is subject to the cap,and passive equity appreciation,which is not see in re chouinard,at holding that passive market appreciation resulting in increased equity is not an interest that a debtor acquires during the statutory period.in contrast,those courts adopting the title definition have crafted an rule that is arguably in conflict with the statutory language indicating that the term interest refers to a quantitative or monetary value see in re sainlar,at holding that p has no applicability to property in which a debtor obtained an ownership interest more than days before the petition date,even if the property equity increases through market appreciation or principal debt reduction during the period see in re blair,at,same see in re anderson,at same.
a homestead interest is not the equivalent of title or equity.
we find it unnecessary at this time to pick a side in the title versus equity debate.a homestead interest is not the equivalent of title or equity.in this case,rogers acquired title to the property when she inherited it from her mother in,which was outside the statutory period.those courts adopting the title definition of interest would conclude that p is inapplicable to rogers.see in re anderson,at.rogers acquired most of her equity in the forney property at the time she inherited it in.those courts adopting the equity definition of interest would also conclude that p is inapplicable to rogers she did not actively acquire equity through making a down payment or monthly mortgage payments on the forney property during the statutory period.see in re rasmussen,at.rogers made capital improvements to the forney property by spending less than of her retirement money to construct a permanent residence,but the aggregate value of those improvements did not exceed.rogers presumably benefitted from market appreciation during the statutory period however,those courts adopting the equity definition of interest have concluded that passive equity appreciation is not acquired by the debtor and not covered by p.id.at.
wallace argues that rogers acquired an interest in the forney property during the period because the divorce decree divested the debtor husband of all right,title,interest,and claim in the forney property and awarded it to the debtor.recently,a bankruptcy court addressed the issue of whether acquiring an community property interest in the homestead property is a form of active equity appreciation that is subject to p.if the forney property had constituted the community property of the debtor and her husband,then wallace argument might have some merit.see in re presto,at.however,the forney property was the debtor separate property because she inherited it from her mother before marriage.see.a trial court in texas has no discretion to divest title to separate property and award that property to the other spouse in a divorce.cameron cameron.in this case,the divorce decree did not increase rogers equity share in the forney property because she owned it as her separate property.rogers did not acquire new value in a homestead through a divorce decree.see in re presto,at.
a homestead interest is not covered by p because it does not constitute a vested economic interest in property.
wallace does not appear to quarrel with the proposition that the debtor acquisition of title or equity during the period can implicate the homestead exemption cap.he is simply advocating a more expansive definition of interest that includes a homestead interest.although other courts have interpreted the term interest more narrowly,we must determine whether the term refers to a broader concept that includes a homestead interest the answer to this federal question,however,largely depends upon state law.united states craft,d.thus,we look initially to state law to determine what rights the debtor had in the forney property pursuant to texas homestead law,then to federal law to determine whether the debtor rights qualify as an interest within the compass of the homestead exemption cap.id.in craft,which addressed whether property held as a tenant by the entirety constituted property and rights to property for purposes of the federal tax lien statute,the supreme court stated the following 
a common idiom describes property as a bundle of sticks a collection of individual rights which,in certain combinations,constitute property.state law determines only which sticks are in a person bundle.whether those sticks qualify as property for purposes of the federal tax lien statute is a question of federal law.in looking to state law,we must be careful to consider the substance of the rights state law provides,not merely the labels the state gives these rights or the conclusions it draws from them.such state law labels are irrelevant to the federal question of which bundles of rights constitute property that may be attached by a federal tax lien.
id.at.internal citations omitted.in craft,the supreme court held that the statutory language authorizing the tax lien is broad and reveals on its face that congress meant to reach every interest in property that a taxpayer might have.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the supreme court held that the husband rights in the entireties property fall within this broad statutory language all property and rights to property.based on the statutory language of p,we find that congress did not intend the scope of the term interest to sweep so broadly.
under texas law,t he homestead interest is a legal interest created by the constitution that provides prophylactic protection from all but a few types of constitutionally permitted liens against homesteads.this interest gives protective legal security rather than vested economic rights.heggen pemelton.although the texas supreme court referred to the homestead interest as a legal interest in heggen,we must look beyond that label and consider the substance of the right conferred by state law.see craft,at.based on our review of the statutory language,we conclude that the term interest as used in p refers to vested economic interests that the debtor acquires in the homestead property during the period preceding the filing of the petition.thus,a homestead interest established within the statutory period,without more,does not fall within the purview of p.
unlike a homestead interest,title and equity both constitute vested economic interests in the homestead property that can be acquired during the period preceding the filing of the petition.these interests are vested because they have an ascertainable economic value at the moment they are acquired by the debtor.in contrast,for purposes of federal bankruptcy law,the homestead exemption is valueless until it is claimed in bankruptcy,such that any value attributable to the exemption is not realized by the debtor until after the filing of the petition.wallace essentially argues that interest refers to all rights that enhance a debtor claimed exemption on schedule however,we believe that interest refers to property interests acquired within the statutory period that the debtor may not exempt from the bankruptcy estate.value as used in p refers to the economic value of the property interests acquired within the statutory period,not the value of the exemption claimed by the debtor.
although we decline to address whether the equity definition of interest is correct,we concur with the reinhard court conclusion that the debtor must acquire vested economic interests in the homestead property during the period.a debtor acquires an interest in property,not in an exemption.see owen,at.t here would be no debtor interest in the property to which a n exemption could attach.a fundamental canon of statutory construction instructs that in the absence of a statutory definition,we give terms their ordinary meaning.hamilton united healthcare of,cir.black law dictionary ed defines interest as a legal share in something all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right in property.similarly,webster third new international dictionary defines interest as right,title,or legal share in something and something in which one has a share of ownership or
