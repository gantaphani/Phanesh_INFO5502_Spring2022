appellant filed an action challenging the failure of respondents to place health warnings mandated by california proposition on their nicotine delivery products,marketed as aids to stop smoking.the trial court granted summary judgment to respondents ruling that certain aspects of proposition are impliedly preempted by the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca et.because the fdca contains a provision that expressly exempts proposition from federal preemption,we will reverse the trial court judgment.
factual and procedural background 
respondents in this action manufacture,market,and distribute products,such as gum and patches,that are designed to help people quit smoking through nicotine replacement therapy the products 
originally,the products were available only by prescription.however in,respondents sought federal food and drug administration fda approval to sell them over the counter.
one aspect of the approval process involved labeling.the fdca includes strict labeling rules,stating that a product is deemed to be misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular,subd.a.respondents application presented a complex labeling issue because the products contain nicotine,a substance recognized by the state of california to cause reproductive toxicity.see,tit,regs,subd.c.on the other hand,fda officials recognized that the purpose of the products is to help individuals stop smoking,a public health goal that should not be frustrated by overwarning.as the chairman of the fda nonprescription drugs advisory committee stated,t his is one of the few instances where we have a product that has come before this committee that i would like lots of people to use,that i think we are underusing so we want to make sure that we are not introducing barriers that would prevent people from using them,and what is worse,somebody continuing to smoke or not calling their physician and talking with him i think,at least as i am interpreting the sense of the committee is that let be real careful on something we want people to use more of that we do introduce barriers that would reduce their willingness to use the product.
partly in an effort to balance these competing concerns,the products underwent an unusually long approval process.at the conclusion of that process,the fda approved the products for sale subject to specific labeling requirements.in each instance,the fda mandated that the products carry the following pregnancy warning nicotine can increase your baby heart rate if you are pregnant or nursing a baby,seek the advice of a health professional before using this product.in the course of processing supplemental new drug applications in the years that followed,the fda told respondents they must use,should use,or to please use,the fda approved pregnancy warning,and that m arketing the product with labeling that is not identical to the approved labeling text may render the product misbranded and an unapproved new drug.
proposition was approved by the voters of this state as an initiative on november.as is relevant here,it added section to the health and safety code which states,no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual the regulations adopted to implement proposition state that the required warning must clearly communicate that the chemical in question is known to the state to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm,subd.a.the regulations also describe optional safe harbor warnings that are deemed to be clear and reasonable,subd.b.one of those warning states as follows,warning this product contains a chemical known to the state of california to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm,subd.b b.finally,the regulations state that the warning may be accomplished in several ways including product labeling,store signs,and public advertising,subds.b a through b c.
in january,respondent mcneil asked the fda for permission to change the label for its product nicotrol,to add the proposition safe harbor warning that we have quoted.the fda denied the request telling mcneil it m ust use the labeling that was approved at the time of approval.
later that same year,the united states congress enacted the food and drug administration modernization act of modernization act of.see stat.the modernization act of added a new section to the fdca,united states code section.subdivision a of section states,in part,n o state or political subdivision of a state may establish or continue in effect any requirement that is different from or in addition to,or that is otherwise not identical with,a requirement under this act section also includes a narrowly focused saving clause which states,this section shall not apply to a state requirement adopted by a state public initiative or referendum enacted prior to september,subd.d.
in august,appellant,acting on behalf of the public,filed the complaint that is at issue in the present appeal.the complaint names respondents as defendants and contains two causes of action.first,appellant alleged respondents violated health and safety code section because they placed products that contained nicotine into the stream of commerce without providing an adequate pregnancy warning as is required by proposition.second,appellant alleged those same acts failing to provide an adequate proposition pregnancy warning constituted an unfair business practice within the meaning of business and professions code section et.appellant asked the court to issue an injunction precluding respondents from offering their products for sale in california without providing an adequate proposition warning.
in november,while the complaint was pending,the fda granted permission to novartis consumer health care,novartis,to sell a smoking cessation product called habitrol.although habitrol contains nicotine and is similar in active ingredients,indication for use,and method of administration to the products at issue in this case,habitrol carried a different fda approved pregnancy warning.the habitrol warning stated as follows,nicotine,whether from smoking or medication,can harm your baby.novartis is not a party to this litigation.
when respondent smithkline learned about the habitrol pregnancy warning,it asked the fda about its own warning.the fda responded that it was reviewing its position as it relates to the warnings of nicotine products concerning pregnancy and breast feeding.
in may,respondents smithkline and mcneil each wrote to the fda,again pointing out that habitrol carried a different pregnancy warning.respondents also noted they were being sued by appellant who was alleging their warning was inadequate.in june,the fda responded to smithkline that although it was reviewing its position on the pregnancy warning,smithkline should continue to use the current warning.
on july,counsel for smithkline wrote to the fda seeking confirmation about the pregnancy warning that was required.the fda responded by letter days later,stating that the products must carry the pregnancy warning that had been specified when they were approved.
in march,the fda sent a letter to smithkline stating that even though habitrol carried a different warning,the instructions concerning respondents products remained unchanged.t he agency is currently reviewing its position regarding the warning on over the counter nicotine replacement products.as we have stated previously,until the agency review is complete,all sponsors of over the counter nicotine replacement products should continue to use the warning that was approved by the agency as part of their new drug approval.any additional or modified warning may render the product misbranded.italics added.
while respondents were working with the fda in an effort to clarify their obligation to warn,appellant filed a motion for summary adjudication.as is relevant here,appellant asked the court to rule that respondents were required under proposition to provide a pregnancy warning.respondents opposed the motion and filed a for summary judgment.they argued,in essence,that any obligation to warn,which they may have had under proposition,was preempted by federal law.
the trial court denied appellant motion for summary adjudication and granted respondents motion for summary judgment,ruling that appellant proposition claims were impliedly preempted by the fdca.the court explained its decision as follows,defendants have been expressly forbidden by the federal government from using the pregnancy warnings on their products that plaintiff contends are required by state law.where,as here,a federal agency requires one thing in accordance with its statutory authority,and a state statute requires another,and where both requirements can not be satisfied simultaneously,conflict preemption exists and the state requirement must yield.in addition,the court ruled that any obligation to provide nonlabel warnings was impliedly preempted because r equiring defendants in advertising to use the same warning that fda has expressly prohibited them from placing on their labels would frustrate the purpose of the fdca 
after the court entered judgment in favor of respondents,appellant filed the present appeal.
by letter dated august,while this appeal was pending,the fda responded to a citizen petition appellant had filed with the agency on august,the fda said it was grant ing appellant request for a consistent pregnancy warning for all over the counter nicotine replacement therapy drug products that clearly and reasonably communicates all of the known harm and conveys the relative reproductive harm of smoking,use of nicotine replacement therapy drug products,and total abstinence from nicotine.the fda proposed that all nicotine replacement products,including the products at issue and habitrol,bear the following uniform pregnancy warning if you are pregnant or,only use this medicine on the advice of your health care provider.smoking can seriously harm your child.try to stop smoking without using any nicotine replacement medicine.this medicine is believed to be safer than smoking.however,the risks to your child from this medicine are not fully known.the agency denied appellant request that it require a warning similar to the harm your baby warning on habitrol.
ii.discussion 
appellant contends the trial court erred when it ruled that respondents obligation to warn under proposition was impliedly preempted by the fdca.
the supremacy clause of article vi of the united states constitution grants to the congress the power to preempt state law it is axiomatic then that state law that conflicts with a federal statute is without effect.cipollone liggett group,d cipollone,quoting maryland louisiana,d.it is equally well established that c onsideration of issues arising under the supremacy clause start s with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superseded by federal act unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.cipollone,at.accordingly,t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone of analysis.ibid.
the united states supreme court has explained that federal preemption arises in three circumstances.first,congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citation.fundamentally is a question of congressional intent,citation and when congress has made its intent known through explicit statutory language,the courts task is an easy one.second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.such an intent may be inferred from a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,or where an act of congress touch es a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.citation.although this court has not hesitated to draw an inference of field where it is supported by the federal statutory and regulatory schemes,it has emphasized where the field which congress is said to have includes areas that have been traditionally occupied by the states,congressional intent to supersede state laws must be clear and manifest.citations.finally,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.thus,the court has found where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,citation or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.english general electric,d,fn.omitted.
the first category above is described as express preemption,while the second and third categories fall under the rubric of implied preemption.choate champion home builders cir,choate.
here,the trial court ruled respondents obligation to warn under proposition was impliedly preempted under the third category.noting that respondents were expressly forbidden by the federal government from using the pregnancy warnings required by state law,the court concluded the requirements of both the fda and proposition can not be satisfied simultaneously in addition,the court ruled that any obligation to provide nonlabel warnings was impliedly preempted because r equiring respondents in advertising to use the same warning that fda has expressly prohibited them from placing on their labels would frustrate the purpose of the fdca 
we turn then,to the pivotal issue in this case whether the trial court ruled correctly when it held that respondents obligation to warn under proposition was impliedly preempted by the fdca.
to answer this question we focus on what we believe is the controlling statute.the modernization act of had many purposes,one of which was to establish national uniformity for nonprescription drugs.see stat.this goal was accomplished by adding united states code section to the fdca,subdivision a of which states,in part,n o state or political subdivision of a state may establish or continue in effect any requirement that is different from or in addition to,or that is otherwise not identical with,a requirement under this act 
the broad language preempting state laws concerning nonprescription drugs is subject to a narrow exception related to state voter initiatives.united states code section,subdivision d states,this section shall not apply to a state requirement adopted by a state public initiative or referendum enacted prior to september.
proposition,by its terms,mandates warnings that are different from and not identical with those called for under the fdca,and thus it comes within the scope of united states code section,subdivision a.however proposition was adopted by the voters of this state as a public initiative in november,and therefore it comes within the saving clause set forth in united states code section,subdivision d.as far as we can determine,proposition is the only state initiative or referendum covered by this saving clause.
these two subdivisions,read together,clearly articulate congress intent.while state laws governing nonprescription drugs are generally preempted by the fdca,proposition is not preempted.
our reading of united states code section is confirmed by the legislative history of the statute.statements made by individual legislators can provide evidence of congress s intent brock pierce county,d,and here,the congressional record confirms that congress intended to exempt proposition from federal preemption.during the floor debates that led up to the enactment of the statute,vermont senator james jeffords stated,now,the states have had authority to move into this area you have to remember they have had this authority forever,i guess,and only one state has taken it upon themselves to really do anything in this area to try and solve the problem what did we do we said,ok,california,fine,we will not get involved with preempting you with respect to your laws that are on the books.we will allow those laws to stand.the fda can work around that.remarks of jeffords,cong.rec,italics added.
during those same debates,california senator barbara boxer stated,finally,i want to thank senators gregg and jeffords for working with me to ensure that california proposition will not be preempted by the uniformity provisions of this bill.california proposition was passed by california voters in and requires that persons who expose others to certain levels of carcinogens or reproductive toxins give a clear and reasonable warning.proposition has successfully reduced toxic contaminants in a number of consumer products sold in california and it has even led the fda to adopt more stringent standards from some consumer products so i am very pleased that the fda reform bill now being debated will exempt california proposition.remarks of boxer,cong.rec,italics added.
the statements we have quoted reinforce our interpretation of united states code section.congress clearly did not intend to preempt proposition under the fdca.since congress has made its intent known through explicit statutory language,our task is an easy one.english general electric,supra,at.the trial court erred when it ruled proposition was preempted by the fdca.
respondents do not dispute our interpretation of united states code section.they concede that under the plain language of that statute,proposition is not expressly preempted by the fdca however,respondents contend the expression of legislative intent set forth in the language of the saving clause avoids express preemption only,and has no bearing on implied conflict preemption analysis.according to respondents,implied conflict preemption arises from operation of the supremacy clause and turns on the existence of an actual conflict.here,various actions taken by the fda prevented them from complying with proposition.because compliance with both the state proposition and federal fda directives are a physical impossibility,proposition is impliedly preempted under the doctrine of implied conflict preemption.this is so despite an explicit statement of congressional intent to the contrary.
we reject the argument.respondents have not cited,and we are not aware of,any case that holds a court can ignore congress clearly articulated and directly applicable express intent to preempt or as here,to save a particular state statutory scheme from preemption based on an analysis of what congress impliedly intended to do.we will not be the first.
respondents base their argument primarily on language taken from a recent supreme court case,geier american honda motor,d geier.in geier,the plaintiff was injured when the car she was driving struck a tree.she sued honda,arguing the car was negligently designed because it lacked a driver side air bag.the issue on appeal was whether plaintiff common law tort claim was preempted by the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of the act.the court ruled first that the act express preemption clause did not apply to the plaintiff suit.geier,supra,at.the court was then required to determine whether a saving clause contained in the act precluded the application of ordinary implied preemption principles.the court said it did not,explaining,we conclude that the saving clause does not bar the ordinary working of conflict principles.nothing in the language of the saving clause suggests an intent to save tort actions that conflict with federal regulations.the words c ompliance and does not exempt,sound as if they simply bar a special kind of defense,namely,a defense that compliance with a federal standard automatically exempts a defendant from state law,whether the federal government meant that standard to be an absolute requirement or only a minimum one it is difficult to understand why congress would have insisted on a precondition to the provision applicability had it wished the act to save all tort actions,regardless of their potential threat to the objectives of federal safety standards promulgated under the act.geier,at.
respondents interpret this passage as meaning that a saving clause can never preclude the application of implied preemption principles.this interpretation ignores the context of the supreme court statement.the court in geier ruled that the particular saving clause at issue did not preclude the application of implied preemption principles.it did not purport to establish some sort of all encompassing rule.this is made clear by the court analysis.the court said an implied preemption analysis was not precluded because n othing in the language of the saving clause suggest ed an intent to save tort actions that conflict with federal regulations.geier,supra,at.here we are faced with precisely the opposite situation.the saving clause set forth in united states code section,subdivision d,not only suggests an intent to save some state law claims,it clearly articulates an express intent to save the precise types of claims that are issue in this case.the portion of geier upon which respondents rely is not controlling.
next,respondents rely on a passage from geier where the court said that the provision,by itself,does not foreclose through negative implication any possibility of implied conflict geier,supra,at.respondents cite this language as supporting the conclusion that an implied preemption analysis is required in all cases.however,the supreme court statement must be read in the context of the case in which it was made.in geier,the court was faced with a preemption clause that did not apply to the claim at issue.id.at.thus,the quote,read in context,simply stands for the proposition that an inapplicable preemption clause does not preclude the possibility of implied conflict preemption.see choate,supra,at,fn.interpreting geier this same way.here,we are called upon to determine the effect of a clearly applicable saving clause.the quoted language from geier is inapposite.
finally,respondents rely on language from geier where the court said that conflict is different in that it turns on the identification of actual conflict,and not on an express statement of intent.citations.geier,supra,at.we have no quarrel with this language or the legal principle it describes.it simply stands for the proposition that there can be implied preemption even where congress did not expressly articulate its intent.here,we are faced with the very different situation where congress has expressed its intent,clearly and specifically.the language quoted can not reasonably be read to support the conclusion that courts may ignore congress clearly articulated intent by applying an implied intent analysis.
in sum,based on our analysis of united states code section,we conclude the fdca does not preempt proposition.just as courts may not find state measures in the absence of clear evidence that congress so intended,so must they give full effect to evidence that congress considered,and sought to preserve,the states coordinate regulatory role in our federal scheme.california ferc,d.
our concurring colleague believes that congress express intention to save proposition from preemption is essentially irrelevant.according to the concurrence,s imply because congress insulated proposition from the express preemption clause does not mean that conflict preemption does not apply.we respectfully disagree.
the concurrence bases its argument on language contained in several recent cases that apply federal conflict preemption.see buckman plaintiffs legal comm,d buckman medtronic,lohr,d medtronic and freightliner myrick,d freightliner.however,none of those cases dealt with preemption in a factual context similar to that presented here.rather,the issue in each case was the scope of federal preemption where express preemption did not apply.specifically,the court in buckman declined to determine whether the express preemption clause at issue was applicable.buckman,at,fn.the same is true of medtronic the court declined to determine whether an express preemption clause applied.medtronic,at.in freightliner,the court ruled the express preemption clause at issue was inapplicable.freightliner,at.in our view,language contained in those cases is not controlling here.unlike the courts in buckman,medtronic,and freightliner,we are called upon to determine the effect of a directly applicable saving clause that clearly expresses congress intent.
similarly,the concurrence relies on language contained in nathan kimmel,dowelanco cir kimmel and choate,supra.but once again,the court in kimmel declined to determine whether the express preemption clause at issue applied,while the choate court found the express preemption clause to be inapplicable.kimmel,at choate,at.those cases are not persuasive where,as here,we are faced with a clearly and directly applicable saving clause.
the concurrence also suggests it would be anomalous for congress to enact a federal law that would allow state law conflicts to exist.the concurrence relies on language from geier where the court stated,why would congress not have wanted ordinary principles to apply where an actual conflict with a federal objective is at stake some such principle is needed.in its absence,state law could impose legal duties that would conflict directly with federal regulatory mandates geier,supra,at.
considered in context,we see no reason to read the language quoted as anything more than a comment on the specific safety standard at issue in geier.moreover,we think it is apparent why congress would allow proposition to conflict with otherwise applicable federal law.congress was not writing on a blank slate when it decided to impose nationwide labeling uniformity for nonprescription drugs as part of the modernization act of.at that point,proposition had been in effect for many years,and it had proven to be highly effective.as senator boxer explained,proposition had successfully reduced toxic contaminants in a number of consumer products sold in california and it had even led the fda to adopt more stringent standards for some consumer products remarks of boxer,cong.rec.we do not find it unusual that congress would allow a longstanding and highly effective state law to remain in effect even though it might conflict with otherwise applicable federal law.
finally,we must comment upon respondents argument that if at any relevant time they failed to comply with the fda repeated directives to use only fda mandated warnings,they faced sanctions for misbranding.respondents urge that the fda position has consistently made it impossible to comply with both proposition and the fdca,and suggest it would be unfair to hold them liable under such circumstances.we need not resolve this controversy.we do observe,nevertheless,that respondents attempts to comply with their state obligations under proposition have been hindered by a federal bureaucracy that,at least since the enactment of the modernization act of,was either unwilling or unable to recognize the limited scope of its authority.it also appears that respondents were further hindered by the fda admitted failure to issue definitive advice about what it deemed to be an appropriate warning label until its august,letter in response to appellant citizen petition.we must leave for another day the issue of whether respondents efforts to satisfy the fda limit or preclude their liability under proposition 
iii.disposition 
the judgment is reversed.costs to appellant.
i agree that the judgment must be reversed.however,i respectfully disagree with my colleagues constitutional analysis.i can not accept the majority decision that congress has excepted the requirements imposed by proposition not only from the express preemption clause but also from the operation of conflict preemption.i would find that congress did no more in section of the food and drug administration modernization act of modernization act of than save proposition from the uniformity provisions,while leaving intact the ban on actual conflicts between state and federal law.i would nevertheless reverse the judgment on the ground that no actual conflict has been demonstrated here.
preemption 
the relatively clear language of the supremacy clause,art.vi,cl has generated a considerable jurisprudence on the question of federal preemption of state law.the united states supreme court has noted three different categories of preemption.state action may be foreclosed by express language in a congressional enactment citation,by implication from the depth and breadth of a congressional scheme that occupies the legislative field citation,or by implication because of a conflict with a congressional enactment citation.lorillard tobacco reilly,d.in the last decade,the high court has struggled with the relationship between express and conflict preemption.that is,to the extent that a federal statute expressly addresses the scope of preemption,is there any place for an implied conflict preemption rule since the high court most recent pronouncements on this subject clearly answer this question in the affirmative,i believe the majority analysis of the manufacturers conflict preemption argument is flawed.
in cipollone liggett group,d,the high court seemed to hold that an express preemption provision precludes the existence of implied preemption congress enactment of a provision defining the reach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are not.in freightliner myrick,d,however,the court clarified its holding in cipollone and held that an express preemption provision,by itself,does not foreclose,through negative implication,any possibility of implied conflict preemption.accord,geier american honda motor,d geier.this conclusion was underscored in medtronic,lohr,d,in which the high court recognized that a state statute left untouched by an express preemption clause might still be preempted under conflict preemption analysis.see nathan kimmel,dowelanco cir,we need not determine the exact length of the preemptive shadow cast by the express language of the statute,however,because ordinary conflict preemption principles dictate that the plaintiff state law claim is impliedly preempted by the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act.scordato,federal preemption of state tort claims davis.
under the preemption doctrine,a saving clause is a statutory provision that restricts the ambit of federal preemption.in recent years,the high court has considered the relationship between such clauses and conflict preemption and has concluded that the existence of a saving clause does not preclude the ordinary working of conflict principles.geier,supra,at.in sum,in determining whether a state law is preempted by a federal provision,the current view of the united states supreme court is that the state law is subject to an implied conflict analysis,even if the applicable federal law contains express preemption and saving clauses.buckman plaintiffs legal comm,d geier,supra,at.see also nathan kimmel,dowelanco,supra,at choate champion home builders cir.
the high court has acknowledged the possibility that congress could insert a saving clause that eliminates conflict as well as express preemption.geier,supra,at.it is no exaggeration to say,however,that the court conveyed substantial skepticism about congress interest in ever doing so why,in any event,would congress not have wanted ordinary principles to apply where an actual conflict with a federal objective is at stake some such principle is needed.in its absence,state law could impose legal duties that would conflict directly with federal regulatory mandates i t would take from those who would enforce a federal law the very ability to achieve the law congressionally mandated objectives that the constitution,through the operation of ordinary principles,seeks to protect.geier,at.o ne can assume that congress or an agency ordinarily would not intend to permit a significant conflict.id.at.neither the dissenting nor the majority opinion in geier cited any case in which a saving clause was so construed.similarly,neither the parties to this appeal nor my colleagues in their majority opinion have found any such case the united states supreme court,in fact,has consistently refused to interpret a saving clause broadly when to do so would permit a state enactment to conflict with a carefully devised regulatory scheme.geier,at.united states locke,d american telephone telegraph central office telephone,d international paper ouellette,d see also wyoming cir,saving clause within the national wildlife refuge system improvement act did not permit state regulation which conflicted with its purpose.
with that framework in mind,i turn now to the federal law at issue.the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca was enacted to protect the public from deleterious,adulterated and misbranded items,including drugs.united states walsh.b.to protect consumers from dangerous products,the fdca requires,among other things,that drugs and devices be labeled with warnings of the risks to the user health.f see generally united states sullivan.sulfathiazole tablets papike tambrands,cir,tampons.moreover,the fdca prohibits labels on drugs and devices that are false or misleading.a.
prior to the modernization act of,the fdca contained no express preemption clause.states were free to require labels different from those mandated by the food and drug administration so long as those warnings did not actually conflict with federal requirements.savage jones.state labeling requirement held nonconflicting and valid mcdermott wisconsin.state labeling requirement in conflict with federal standards held invalid.there is no dispute that,with the enactment of the modernization act of,congress expressly intended to establish national uniformity for labeling of nonprescription drugs and to preempt state law with respect to labeling n o state may establish or continue in effect any requirement that is different from or in addition to,or that is otherwise not identical with,a requirement under the fdca.a.the dispute in this case concerns not congress intent to preempt state law but its intent to save proposition from this preemption.
congress carved out of the express preemption clause an exception for certain state initiatives except as provided in subsection d,no state may impose requirements that differ from,add to,or are not identical to federal requirements.a,italics added.section d,in turn,provides this section shall not apply to a state requirement adopted by a state public initiative or referendum enacted prior to september.proposition comes within this exception and is apparently the only state initiative to qualify there is no doubt that this saving clause permits california,when acting pursuant to proposition,to require label warnings that differ from,add to,or are otherwise not identical to the label requirements imposed under the fdca.i can not accept,however,the majority conclusion that this saving clause further permits california to impose labeling requirements that actually conflict with federal requirements.
my colleagues conclude that because it is clear that congress enacted an express preemption clause creating uniformity and then expressly saved proposition from the uniformity requirements,it is inappropriate to search for an implied legislative intent to retain actual conflict preemption.they say respondents have not cited,and we are not aware of,any case that holds a court can ignore congress clearly articulated and directly applicable express intent to preempt or as here,to save a particular state statutory scheme from preemption based on an analysis of what congress impliedly intended to do.we will not be the first,ante,at.
this analysis seems to ignore the decisions discussed above.simply because congress insulated proposition from the express preemption clause does not mean that conflict preemption does not apply.of course,under geier,congress could express an intent to reverse the normal operation of the supremacy clause and permit conflicting state law to reign supreme,a prospect the high court viewed as unlikely.but the majority does not rely on any textual analysis of either the preemption or the saving clause to indicate such a congressional intent.
certainly nothing in the saving clause warrants a conclusion that congress wished to bypass the conflict preemption doctrine.in my view,the scope of the saving clause coincides with the scope of the preemption clause.that is,the express preemption clause imposes national uniformity for nonprescription drugs,stat,and the saving clause creates an exception for california,acting through proposition.as a matter of logic,the saving clause for proposition does nothing more than serve as a shield,protecting proposition from the effects of the uniformity provisions of the modernization act of.the majority points to no language in the two clauses,and i find none,that permits california to act so as to frustrate any statutory purpose other than uniformity.see united states locke,supra,at.in my view,proposition remains limited by the doctrine of conflict preemption and may not interfere with the congressional purpose expressed in the fdca of protecting the consumer from dangerous or misbranded products.
this interpretation of the saving clause does not render it ineffectual.to the contrary,unlike any other state,california when acting pursuant to proposition is entitled to adopt warnings different from as well as additional to those required by federal law.unlike other states,the only limitation california faces is that these warnings may not actually conflict with the fdca.proposition is saved by being left precisely where it was before the uniform labeling law of the modernization act of took effect,allowed to impose different,but not conflicting requirements.
my colleagues rely on the comments of senators boxer and jeffords to support their interpretation.without quarreling with the propriety of relying on such statements,i believe these particular remarks provide little support to their construction.in the portion of senator boxer remarks emphasized by the majority,she is quoted as thanking other senators for working with me to ensure that california proposition will not be preempted by the uniformity provisions of this bill and so i am very pleased that the fda reform bill now being debated will exempt california proposition.remarks of boxer,ante.these remarks do not suggest that senator boxer believed she had not only managed to fend off the uniformity requirements but had also succeeded in eliminating the narrow conflict preemption limitation the initiative had always faced.in fact,in remarks between the ones quoted by my colleagues,senator boxer lauds the accomplishments of the proposition proposition has successfully reduced toxic contaminants in a number of consumer products sold in california and it has even led the fda to adopt more stringent standards for some consumer products.remarks of boxer,at.these hardly sound like the words of someone who thought it was necessary to change the legal landscape under which the proposition had been functioning.
the remarks of senator jeffords must be considered in context.he and senator kennedy apparently disagreed about the uniformity provisions relating to the labeling or packaging of cosmetics.on september,when the quoted remarks were made see,ante,this provision as it was then worded concerned senator kennedy because it precluded states from enacting legislation to protect their citizens.he described california as being grandfathered in that is protected from the upcoming regulatory change and sought a similar status for massachusetts and other states.remarks of kennedy.though they preceded the comments of senator kennedy,the remarks of senator jeffords seem responsive to that concern,only california had acted in the past to deal with cosmetics and therefore it had received special protection from future preemption.remarks of jeffords.senator jeffords,like senator boxer,never alluded to changing the ground rules proposition faced before the modernization act of.
ii.proposition is not preempted 
having concluded that the doctrine of conflict preemption applies despite the existence of the saving clause,i now turn to the determinative question whether proposition actually conflicts with federal law.the rule is that an actual conflict between state and federal law will be found either where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal standards or where under the circumstances of a particular case the challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.crosby national foreign trade council,d.as i see it,the principal question requiring analysis here is the federal purposes would be thwarted by requiring proposition compliant language on either packaging labels or point of sale signs 
what constitutes a sufficient obstacle to the fulfillment of congress objectives so as to create a conflict is a matter of judgment,to be informed by examining the federal statute as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects.crosby national foreign trade council,supra,at.consideration must also be given to whether state law is an obstacle to the goals expressed in the administrative regulations issued by the agency charged with implementing the federal statute.geier,supra,at.state tort lawsuit held preempted by vehicle safety regulation issued by the federal department of transportation.in my judgment,proposition poses no obstacle to the purposes and intended effects of the fdca or its implementing regulations.geier instructs that a court should not find too readily in the absence of clear evidence of a conflict.geier,at.i find no such evidence here.
as already indicated,a principal purpose of the fdca is to protect consumers from dangerous products by requiring warnings of the risks to the user health.f.proposition has the same objective,to give adequate warning to consumers.health.compliance with proposition would not frustrate the objective of the fdca.chemical specialties mfrs.ass n,allenby,supra,at no conflict between proposition and federal hazardous substances act.
of course,the congressional purpose of establishing national uniformity in the labeling of nonprescription drugs would be thwarted by warnings that are different from the warnings required by the fdca.but congress has excepted proposition from the uniform labeling requirement.a,d.by expressly allowing california,through proposition,to require labeling that differs from or adds to the labeling required by the fdca,congress has nullified any argument that its goal of uniformity would be thwarted by enforcement of proposition.past assertions by the food and drug administration fda notwithstanding,the mere fact that a proposed warning differs from or adds to the its mandated warning can not render the product misbranded.
another purpose of the fdca is to protect consumers by ensuring that the labels on drugs and devices are not false or misleading.a.to that end,the fda regulations require that labeling on drugs be clear and truthful in all respects.a v.labeling must include warnings expressed in such terms as to render them likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual,including individuals of low comprehension,under customary conditions of purchase and use.ibid.there is nothing in proposition inconsistent with that federal objective.proposition requires a clear and reasonable message when a product contains a chemical known to cause cancer or birth defects or reproductive harm.health.under state regulations implementing proposition,for consumer products that contain a chemical known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity,a warning in the following language is deemed clear and reasonable warning this product contains a chemical known to the state of california to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm,tit,subd.b b.the state regulations require that the message be displayed so that it is likely to be read and understood by an ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase or use,tit,subd.b.
in a lawsuit filed under proposition,a plaintiff is not required to persuade the court that a particularly worded warning is appropriate rather,a plaintiff burden is to demonstrate that a defendant warning fails to comply with that law requirements.for this reason,respondents preemption defense can succeed only if all possible consumer product warnings that would satisfy proposition actually conflict with the federal standards.comm.of dental amalgam mfrs.distribs.stratton cir,chemical specialties mfrs.ass n,allenby,supra,at people ex rel.lungren cotter,supra,th at,d.the state regulations implementing proposition provide that warnings other than the safe harbor warnings are not precluded as long as the message clearly conveys that the chemical in question is known to cause cancer or birth defects or reproductive harm,tit,subd.a.
the respondents argue,however,that the warning prescribed by the fda for nicotine replacement therapy nrt products establishes a ceiling as well as a floor and that the fda has prohibited any proposition warning.this argument is premised on the notion that all possible proposition warnings would interfere with the fda stated policy against overwarning consumers about the risks inherent in nrt products,because this overwarning would discourage consumers from trying to stop smoking.
respondents have not presented any formal fda regulation on overwarning.respondents point to a variety of less formal sources,which,they contend,establish its determination that proposition warnings constitute overwarning numerous letters exchanged between the fda and the respondents,from through,in which it rejected requests to permit the addition of certain supplemental warnings on nrt products a letter from the fda to the california attorney general,dated june,in which it rejected a request to compel the respondents to add the proposition safe harbor warning to their products and the august,fda response to appellant citizen petition the response,denying appellant request to add a particular proposition warning to the products.respondents contention is unavailing.
the correspondence between the fda and respondents was entirely too informal to establish a policy that would justify invoking the supremacy clause to invalidate a state law.the fda letters seem to be nothing more than a formulaic response directing the manufacturers not to act while a review of the issue was conducted.in fact,in its amicus curiae brief,the fda acknowledges that the correspondence between it and the manufacturers did not constitute a formal directive or set out a definitive fda policy on proper warnings.
the fda letter to the california attorney general,by its own terms,rejects only the proposition safe harbor warning.moreover,the stated rationale for this conclusion,that the data justifies a warning only that nicotine may increase fetal heart rate,was specifically disavowed by it in the august response.
the response makes no determination that all proposition warnings conflict with an fda policy on overwarning.it expresses a concern about any warning that discourages consumer use of nrt products.the fda determined that consumers might be misled by a warning that contains the phrase n icotine can harm your baby.its criticism was directed,however,only at the specific warning proposed by appellant in his citizen petition,which was patterned after the habitrol warning if pregnant or,ask a health professional before use.nicotine,whether from smoking or medication,can harm your baby.first try to stop smoking without the patch.in the fda view,the habitrol warning urged by appellant exaggerates the certainty and dimension of the harm by equating the harm resulting from nrt products with the harm resulting from smoking.nothing in the response provides clear evidence that the fda would find all warnings that comply with proposition to be insufficient or confusing.
it seems more consistent with the language of the response to view the fda concern about overwarning as a corollary of its objective of ensuring clear and accurate labeling.a a v.in its response,the fda recognized the particular problems posed by nrt products when fashioning an adequate statement of the risks to the user nrt drug products pose significant challenges as compared to other drugs as they are indicated to break the addiction to smoking,a condition that is known to cause harm.when determining the proper labeling for these products,the fda is faced with the difficult task of relaying the relative risks of the potential harm from nrt products versus the known harm caused by the continued use of tobacco products.the complexity of the data regarding exposure to nicotine during pregnancy and the relative risks of smoking versus use of nrt products are not easily translated to consumer friendly language on an package.
to be sure,a warning imposed by proposition that is inaccurate and misstates the risks of an drug would violate federal standards and be preempted.the manufacturers assert that any proposition warning would be false because nrt products are not truly known to cause reproductive harm.but this argument misstates the nature of the proposition warning.proposition does not require warnings about the harm of using particular products the proposition warning is that the product contains a chemical known to cause reproductive harm.there is no dispute that the nrt products contain nicotine and that nicotine is linked to reproductive harm.california law explicitly recognizes a causative relationship,tit,subd.c,and,as evidenced by this record,california relied upon information obtained from the fda as a basis for listing nicotine as a reproductive toxin.see,tit,subd.a,subd.l.even in its most recent communiqué,based on current data,the fda continues to recognize a causative connection between nicotine and reproductive harm,although it is unable to quantify the precise contribution of nicotine to reproductive toxicity in its response,the fda explained c hronic nicotine exposure may represent some risk in humans for lethality while smoking has clearly been associated with fetal harm,the contribution of nicotine has not been clearly delineated c igarette smoking results in the exposure of the fetus to a number of harmful substances,and it is impossible to ascertain the exact contribution of nicotine to the harm caused by smoking.
the fda recognition of the possibility of harm from nicotine is further evidenced in the label announced by the fda in its response if you are pregnant or,only use this medicine on the advice of your health care provider.smoking can seriously harm your child.try to stop smoking without using any nicotine replacement medicine.this medicine is believed to be safer than smoking.however,the risks to your child from this medicine are not fully known.boldface type in original.the admonition that consumers should try to avoid using the product and use the product only with a doctor advice,together with the statement that the risks of nrt products are not fully known,reflect the fda assessment that nicotine indeed may cause harm.
there is no apparent reason why the new warning could not be supplemented with the simple insertion,after the first sentence of that warning,of a statement,consistent with proposition,acknowledging the risk that nicotine may cause fetal harm.this supplemental information about nicotine would in no way undermine the congressional goal of protecting consumers from unknown risks.and an accurate statement would certainly not violate the goal of truthful labeling.if anything,such an addition would seem to improve the clarity of the message to the consumer by revealing the reasons for the label admonitions.
in appropriate circumstances,it may be true that overwarning or underwarning of the risks could render a package label false or misleading.however,in the circumstances here,when applied to proposition,there appears to be no basis for the fda to reject accurate,easily understood supplemental warnings about nicotine simply because the warnings have the potential to discourage the use of an nrt product.nothing in the fdca reflects a congressional intent to limit clear and accurate warnings of health risks so that consumers might be more inclined to take advantage of certain beneficial products.motus pfizer,d,fn.to the contrary,congress has expressly allowed california to add its own supplemental warnings through proposition.the fda has no legitimate reason,within the scope of its authority to implement the fdca,to soften the warning about nicotine any more than it has legitimate reason to soften warnings on other risky drugs that may have health benefits.
it is worth noting that the fda own regulations allow a manufacturer to add or strengthen a warning label without waiting for prior fda approval.c i.contrary to the assertion of the fda in its amicus curiae brief,a preapproval label supplement is not confined to minor editorial changes.in fact,the regulations allow minor editorial changes to be made without any fda approval at all.d.the implication from the regulations is that additional warnings to the consumer by the manufacturer are too important to defer until after the approval process is complete.it is difficult to understand,then,how the addition of warnings mandated by proposition would frustrate federal objectives when warnings voluntarily affixed would not 
respondents may,of course,be correct and the response may have been intended to state an fda policy on overwarning that would bar any modification of its proposed warning.the disquiet expressed in that document about the phrase can harm your baby may reflect a concern that would equally ban compliance with proposition regardless of the language of the warning in its entirety.if so,then it would appear that the fda concern for overwarning disguises the its actual goal of establishing label uniformity.in its response,the fda concluded that labeling of nrt products should be consistent and uniform and,while manufacturers may also consider a different warning,they will have to provide data to support alternative wording.that pronouncement flies in the face of the saving clause d,by which congress has given its imprimatur to different or supplemental warnings required by proposition.the fda recognized the difficulty of achieving the goal of a clear statement of the risks of nrt products but failed to perceive that it is in precisely this type of situation that the congressional desire to permit variance needs to be honored.
in summary,i would conclude that proposition is not saved from any actual conflict with federal labeling standards.however,no actual conflict exists.compliance with both proposition and federal regulations would not be physically impossible,nor would compliance with proposition interfere with congressional or fda purposes.i concur in the majority decision that the judgment must be reversed.
