nine years ago,plaintiffs sparkle hill,and its vice president and owner william warming collectively,sparkle hill received an unsolicited advertisement on sparkle hill fax machine from defendant interstate mat corporation interstate.not one to act hastily,sparkle hill filed suit against interstate in federal district court almost five years later,alleging a violation of the telephone consumer protection act the act.the act allows recipients of unsolicited fax advertisements to recover from the sender in statutory damages trebled for willful and knowing violations for each fax transmission.id.b c,b.invoking federal rule of civil procedure b,sparkle hill sought to proceed both individually and on behalf of others who also received an identical fax from interstate in may.interstate sought summary judgment on the ground that a statute of limitations barred sparkle hill claim.sparkle hill filed no opposition,and the district court thereupon entered summary judgment dismissing the case.we now affirm.
background 
the parties do not dispute the facts relevant to this appeal.interstate,a massachusetts corporation with four employees,paid a marketing firm to fax to potential customers a advertisement for interstate antifatigue floor mats.in may,the marketing firm transmitted interstate advertisement to recipients.one of those recipients was sparkle hill,a new jersey corporation.another was west concord store,west concord,a massachusetts corporation.aside from later litigation,interstate never received any response to its fax advertisement.
more than three and a half years later,on january,west concord represented by the same plaintiffs counsel who now represent sparkle hill filed a class action against interstate in massachusetts superior court for sending unsolicited fax advertisements in violation of the act.see b c,b.the state court complaint alleged a class of a ll persons who received a fax advertisement from interstate.
more than one year after west concord filed the state class action and nearly five years after the fax transmissions,sparkle hill filed this lawsuit in federal district court individually and on behalf of a class of a ll persons who received a fax from interstate.given a putative class of more than fax recipients,and statutory damages of for each fax sent,interstate faced more than in damages liability,potentially tripled if interstate was found to have willfully and knowingly violated the act.id.b.
on may,west concord filed a motion in state court to certify a class of a ll persons in massachusetts who were successfully sent a facsimile from interstate in may.about a month later,sparkle hill moved in federal district court to certify a class of a ll persons who were successfully sent a facsimile from interstate in may.the federal district court acted first,and certified sparkle hill requested class on december.sparkle hill,interstate mat,cv rwz,wl,at,see also.b.several months later,the state trial court refused to certify a class of massachusetts fax recipients because of the court doubts about west concord ability to represent the class,the lack of predominant common facts,the enormous contrast between interstate mat potential liability and the actual harm suffered by potential class members,and the inescapable conclusion that these class actions exist for the benefit of the attorneys who are bringing them and not for the benefit of individuals who are truly aggrieved.west concord store,interstate mat,c,wl,at.
in federal court,sparkle hill filed a motion for summary judgment on may.interstate opposed sparkle hill motion by disputing both that the faxes were unsolicited advertisements and also that it willfully and knowingly violated the act.interstate also for summary judgment,asserting that the applicable statute of limitations barred sparkle hill claim under the act.see a federal statute of limitations.sparkle hill filed a reply brief in support of its own motion for summary judgment,but did not address the merits of the statute of limitations defense interstate had raised.instead,sparkle hill filed a motion to strike as untimely interstate motion for summary judgment.eight months later,the district court denied sparkle hill motion to strike.at the same time,the district court gave sparkle hill an additional days to file an opposition to the merits of interstate limitations defense.the days passed with no word from sparkle hill.
after waiting two more months,the district court entered summary judgment for interstate on may.the district court interpreted sparkle hill silence in the face of interstate limitations defense as a concession.because sparkle hill d id not respond to the limitations defense,the court allow ed interstate motion for that reason.sparkle hill,interstate mat,cv rwz,wl,at.may.
wisely adding belt to suspenders,see.e,the district court also addressed the merits of interstate statute of limitations defense and concluded that sparkle hill claim under the act was id.at.sparkle hill received the fax in may but did not file suit until february,well after the limitations period the district court found applied the district court considered whether west concord state court class action tolled the statute of limitations for sparkle hill subsequent class action.see american pipe constr.utah,d t he commencement of the original class suit tolls the running of the statute for all purported members of the class who make timely motions to intervene after the court has found the suit inappropriate for class action status.crown,cork seal parker,d extending american pipe tolling to class members who file their own suits after the denial of class certification.the district court concluded that our precedent foreclosed the application of american pipe tolling to sequential class actions,as opposed to class members individual actions.see basch ground round,cir plaintiffs may not stack one class action on top of another and continue to toll the statute of limitations indefinitely.
sparkle hill then filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b to vacate the district court order and clarify the memorandum opinion to decertify the class.the rule b motion did not contest the district court conclusion that sparkle hill could not stack one class action on top of another to extend the limitations period.nor did it challenge the district court reliance on sparkle hill failure to respond as a basis for granting summary judgment.sparkle hill instead advanced a limited argument that even if american pipe tolling did not apply to its class action,tolling might still apply to its and the other class members individual claims.therefore,sparkle hill argued,the district court should have decertified the class and allowed class members to pursue individual tolling arguments,instead of entering judgment for interstate.the district court denied sparkle hill motion without explanation.
sparkle hill timely appealed.in its opening brief on appeal sparkle hill offers no argument at all for finding error in the district court decision to hold sparkle hill accountable for its lack of opposition to interstate limitations defense.instead,sparkle hill brief argues the merits of the limitations defense as applied both to the class and to sparkle hill.after interstate in its brief blew the whistle on sparkle hill failure to challenge the district court reliance on its procedural defalcation,sparkle hill in its reply brief made two new points because the burden of proving an affirmative limitations defense rested with interstate,sparkle hill failure to oppose the motion was of no moment and any waiver was harmless,and should fit within an exception to the normal rules concerning waiver 
ii.analysis 
we have seen this story before.a district court dismisses a claim for perceived procedural defalcations the losing party then files a brief on appeal arguing the substantive merits of its claim,saving for its reply brief any argument challenging the actual,procedural basis for the district court ruling.see,díaz colón fuentes agostini,wl,at cir.may.our precedent is clear we do not consider arguments for reversing a decision of a district court when
