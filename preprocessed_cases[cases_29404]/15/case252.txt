opinion of the court 
in this matter involving competing mass tort class actions in federal and state courts,we address an interlocutory appeal in a complex multidistrict federal class action comprising six million members from an order enjoining a mass opt out of a state class.we will affirm.
the underlying case involves two drugs,both appetite suppressants,as pondimin and as redux.both drugs were in great demand.between and,four million people took pondimin and two million people took redux.in,data came to light suggesting a link between the drugs use and valvular heart disease.in july,the united states food and drug administration issued a public health advisory alert.on september,american home products removed both drugs from the market.subsequent clinical studies support the view the drugs may cause valvular heart damage.
following the fda issuance of the public health warning,several lawsuits were filed.the number of lawsuits increased exponentially after american home products withdrew the diet drugs from the market.approximately eighteen thousand individual lawsuits and over one hundred putative class actions were filed in federal and state courts around the country.american home products removed many of the state cases to federal courts,increasing the number of federal cases.in december,the judicial panel for multidistrict litigation transferred all the federal actions to judge louis bechtle in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,creating multidistrict litigation mdl.
in april,american home products began global settlement talks with plaintiffs in the federal action together with several plaintiffs in similar state class actions.the parties reached a tentative settlement agreement for a nationwide class in november.known as the brown class,the proposed class included all persons in the united states,as well as their representatives and dependents,who had ingested either or both of the diet drugs.the global settlement contemplated different kinds of relief,including medical care,medical screening,payments for injury,and refunds of the drugs purchase price.
the provisions were separated into two sections,one for those who had taken the drugs for sixty days or less,the other for those who had taken the drugs for more than sixty days.short term users were to be paid per month use of pondimin,and per month use of redux.long term users would receive the same amounts per month,subject to a cap and the availability of sufficient money in an overall settlement fund.unlike short term users,long term users were entitled to other benefits,such as medical screening.
the district court entered an order on november,conditionally certifying a nationwide settlement class and,concurrently,preliminarily approving the settlement.to opt out,a class member was to sign and submit written notice to the claims administrator s with a copy to american home products,clearly manifesting the class member intent to opt out of the settlement.the period extended until march.the court scheduled a fairness hearing for may,on class certification and final settlement approval.on august,the district court entered a final order certifying the class and approving the settlement.
in july the fda warning,but before american home products withdrew the drugs from the filed a putative class action in texas state court,gonzalez et medeva pharmaceuticals,et.the gonzalez case was one of the first cases filed and preceded the creation of mdl by several months.the proposed gonzalez class,including all texas purchasers of the two diet drugs,was a subset of what would become the brown class.the gonzalez action was limited insofar as it sought actual recovery only,together with treble damages under the texas deceptive trade practices protection act dtpa.bus,et.
the gonzalez complaint did not allege a federal cause of action and the named parties were not diverse.nonetheless,in january,american home products removed the case to federal court shortly after mdl was created,contending federal diversity jurisdiction obtained.american home products asserted medeva pharmaceuticals,a defendant,was fraudulently joined for the purpose of defeating diversity jurisdiction.soon after removal to the united states district court for the southern district of texas,the gonzalez case was transferred to the eastern district of pennsylvania as a part of mdl.
shortly thereafter,the gonzalez plaintiffs moved to remand the case back to texas state court,contending medeva pharmaceuticals was a proper defendant.the gonzalez plaintiffs also argued the requirement was not met,as recovery would only amount to a few hundred or,perhaps,a few thousand dollars per plaintiff.furthermore,they argued they would not be seeking statutory attorneys fees under the texas dtpa.as noted,on november,judge bechtle granted conditional certification of the brown class and preliminary approval of the settlement.on february,the mdl district court granted the gonzalez plaintiffs motion for remand,finding that medeva pharmaceuticals was a proper defendant.
one month later,on march,the gonzalez plaintiffs filed a new complaint,their fifth amended class action petition,in the district court of hidalgo county,texas.they dropped their class claims against medeva pharmaceuticals and claimed entitlement to statutory attorneys fees.accordingly,american home products contends,the barriers to federal diversity jurisdiction were removed.
less than a week later,on march,the hidalgo county court held a hearing on certification of the gonzalez class.on march,it certified the class,defined as all persons who purchased dexfenfluramine redux fenfluramine pondimin in texas,who are solely seeking the recovery of the amounts to acquire same,as well as any statutory trebling which may result from the claims asserted under the texas deceptive trade practices consumer protection act.the certification of the gonzalez class occurred eight days before the end of the period for the brown settlement.at this time,most members of the gonzalez class were also members of the brown class,except for those who had individually opted out.
on march,the same day as the entry of the texas class certification order,the gonzalez plaintiffs acted to erase this overlap,by moving,in hidalgo county,for a court order opting out all of the unnamed members of the gonzalez class from the brown class.the texas court scheduled a hearing for the next morning.in response,american home products sought a temporary restraining order in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,the mdl court,seeking to prevent the gonzalez class from implementing a mass opt out.
on march,hearings were held in both courts on their respective motions.in texas,the hidalgo county court held its hearing and the same day entered an order partially opting out the gonzalez class from mdl.the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania also issued an order that day,granting american home products motion and entering a temporary restraining order directed against the relief sought at the texas hearing.the federal order denied the effect of the opt out and ordered gonzalez class counsel to refrain from pursuing the opt out.it was to remain in effect for ten days.a hearing was scheduled for march on whether to make the injunction permanent.the district court order was dated,march,at for what it is worth,the hidalgo county court would later issue an order clarifying that its order had been issued before eastern time.
the texas order purported to opt out the gonzalez class from mdl only partially 
i t is ordered,adjudged and decreed that the unnamed members of the certified class in this case be sic are hereby of the proposed settlement in mdl,solely to the effect that their purchase price recovery claims,and potential dtpa trebling of same,will be pursued in this case,accordingly,any and all of their other claims,including but not limited to,claims for medical screening,medical monitoring,personal injury,mental anguish punitive damages are not effected sic by this order 
gonzalez medeva,at.the texas court also ordered that class counsel shall take all other steps necessary,if any,to the entire certified class in this case from the proposed settlement in mdl to the extent,and only to the extent,set forth in the preceding paragraph.id.
on march,american home products took further legal action.first,it filed a second notice of removal to the united states district court for the southern district of texas,contending diversity jurisdiction obtained at that time.it also with lead counsel for the brown motion for a permanent injunction and declaration with respect to the hidalgo county court attempt to opt out the unnamed texas plaintiffs 
on march,the district court held a hearing on american home products motion for a permanent injunction and declaration.one of the gonzalez class attorney,john macpete,was admitted pro hac vice for the purpose of opposing the motion.at the hearing,judge bechtle announced his intention to enter the permanent order sought by american home products and brown class counsel,stating the order of the hidalgo county court would interfere with this court jurisdiction and the administration of this case,as well as the right and obligation of this court to bring this proceeding to a final judgment.on april,the district court issued a written order,pto subject of this appeal.
pto,entitled permanent injunction and declaration regarding purported,contains two main parts.the first is an injunction directed primarily at counsel for the gonzalez class 
counsel for the named plaintiffs in gonzalez medeva pharmaceuticals,et,originally filed in hidalgo county,texas and removed to the united states district court for the southern district of texas on march,and all those acting in concert with them,are hereby permanently enjoined from taking any action to effect,secure,or issue notice of any purported class opt out,on behalf of the unnamed absent members of any class which may have been certified in gonzalez,from the class action settlement which this court has conditionally certified and preliminary sic approved 
the second part is declaratory in nature.it states,insofar as the hidalgo county order purports to affect or determine the opt out status of any member of the mdl class it is null and void and of no effect.the district court also stated,the hidalgo county order is also null and void and of no effect insofar as it purports to authorize or effect a partial on behalf of any member of the mdl class.id.at.this was because the texas order interfere d with the district court authority to determine the means and methods by which members of such class may elect to opt out of the class.id.at.
on april,the gonzalez plaintiffs moved to remand gonzalez back to state court a second time.the remand motion was considered in the federal district court for the southern district of texas on may.that court declined to rule on the motion,referring it instead to judge bechtle,assuming gonzalez would be referred to his court as part of mdl.on may,the mdl panel transferred gonzalez to the eastern district of pennsylvania.american home products contends the gonzalez plaintiffs made no attempt,following transfer,to seek resolution of the remand motion by judge bechtle in the eastern district of pennsylvania.in any event,no action has been taken directly on the gonzalez matter in federal court since its transfer in may.
the day after they filed their motion to remand,the gonzalez plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of pto.both american home products and brown class representatives are appellees.
on august,judge bechtle issued a final order certifying the brown class and approving the settlement the gonzalez case was,at that time,one of the cases consolidated settled as part.judge bechtle also issued,concurrently,a blanket injunction against commencement or prosecution of parallel actions in other courts.
appellants challenge pto on several grounds.their principal arguments address whether the district court overstepped the limitations on its power with respect to state court actions.appellants contend the district court order violates the limitations on federal courts enjoining state court proceedings under the act fails to afford the texas order full faith and credit and violates the doctrine prohibition on lower federal courts reviewing state court decisions.additionally,they challenge the district court personal jurisdiction over the gonzalez plaintiffs and their counsel 
because there exists a strong policy to conserve judicial time and resources,we have held that preliminary matters such as personal jurisdiction should be raised and disposed of before the court considers the merits or of a controversy.chemrite pty,cir quoting wyrough loser,pelmor,cir.accordingly,we turn first to appellants challenge to the district court in personam jurisdiction 
because the district court enjoined counsel for the gonzalez plaintiffs from pursuing the mass opt out,it must first have obtained personal jurisdiction over these attorneys.appellants deny the court either had jurisdiction over members of the gonzalez class or their attorneys.
ordinarily,in personam jurisdiction depends on sufficient minimum contacts with the forum,such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.quotation omitted.the minimum contacts requirement is satisfied where a class member has received adequate notice of the action and has been afforded an has opt out of the lawsuit.phillips petroleum shutts,d see also carlough amchem,cir p rior to notice and the opt out period,and absent minimum contacts with the pennsylvania forum or consent to its jurisdiction,a federal injunction enjoining state action would violate due process.the court in shutts also stated,t he due process clause of course requires that the named plaintiff at all times adequately represent the interests of the absent class members.at.
appellants do not contest the adequacy of the notice sent to the unnamed class members in texas.because any remaining unnamed class members had not opted out of the brown class,all unnamed brown class members were subject to the jurisdiction of the district court for purposes of mdl,so long as they were adequately represented.the named gonzalez plaintiffs had opted out of the brown class,so they may not be properly deemed to have impliedly consented to jurisdiction under the shutts rule.at.see also carlough,at a plaintiff class member who is afforded an opportunity to opt out,but who fails to exercise that option,may be deemed to have consented to jurisdiction.regardless,the substantial majority of the gonzalez class was subject to shutts jurisdiction,assuming adequate representation.
appellants contend,however,the members of the gonzalez class were not adequately represented by the named brown plaintiffs.they argue the interests of the gonzalez are seeking only at odds with the interests of many of the brown subset of whom seek recovery for injuries,including the possibility of future injuries.appellants cite several cases in which settlements have been rejected for inadequate representation where there were competing subclasses,ortiz fibreboard,d finding impermissible conflict between plaintiffs exposed to asbestos during period manufacturer was fully insured,and those exposed later amchem,windsor,d.appellants also contend the relief contemplated by the settlement is substantially less than that sought in gonzalez.
that various subclasses in the brown class could find themselves in competition does not by itself establish an actual conflict undermining adequacy of representation.in its final certification order,the district court made extensive findings supporting the opposite conclusion.in particular,it found there were no between the classes the benefits had been bargained for separately and there was no conflict between those seeking future benefits and those seeking them immediately.appellants have challenged none of these findings.for this reason alone,there is no basis on which to find actual conflicts sufficient to establish that plaintiffs were not adequately represented.accordingly,the district court had personal jurisdiction over all unnamed members of the brown class,including those also members of the gonzalez class.because the district court had personal jurisdiction over members of the gonzalez class,it also had jurisdiction over attorneys purporting to represent,and act on behalf of,that subset of the brown class.carlough,at affirming finding of jurisdiction underlying injunction aimed at class members and their attorneys and representatives.
furthermore,the relief sought in texas was squarely aimed at mdl and at the status of the texas plaintiffs in that action.as such,the therefore,the named gonzalez plaintiffs on whose behalf they acted should reasonably have anticipate d being haled into court there.volkswagen woodson,d.consequently,no traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice are offended by the district court asserting jurisdiction over either these plaintiffs or their attorneys.
appellants central based on the anti injunction act,the full faith and credit act,and the address constraints on the district court authority to limit state court actions and their effects.but american home products maintains it is unnecessary to address these arguments because it had removed the case to federal court a second time before entry of pto,thereby dissolving any possible conflict.
american home products contends its filing of the removal notice immediately defeated the jurisdiction of the state court,placing it in the federal court after removal,interlocutory orders of the state court are transformed into orders of the court to which the case is removed thus,they contend,the hidalgo county court order purporting to opt gonzalez class members out of the brown class was,at the time of pto,an order of the federal court.and it remains so,as the gonzalez case has not since been remanded.if there were a jurisdictional conflict,american home products contends,it was between two federal courts,not between a federal and a state court.
we do not believe resolution along these lines is so clear cut.pto was essentially a reiteration of the district court original temporary restraining order,which had been issued before the second removal and was effective for a period.removal,therefore,occurred during the effective period of the district court temporary restraining order blocking the effect of the texas the midst of a conflict between the federal and state courts.by filing a removal notice during the pendency of the temporary restraining order,american home products attempted to resolve a significant existing dispute involving difficult issues of federal and state authority.and it did so in the face of an potentially modifiable ruling remanding the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
this case illustrates the remarkable extent to which lawsuits can be turned into procedural entanglements.one view of this may be that the actions taken here represent nothing more than astute lawyering.another is that the legal jockeying employed by both sides exhibits a proclivity to attempt to manipulate the rules for immediate tactical use at odds with the purposes of these rules,and one dissonant with the equitable nature of class action proceedings.
rather than enter this tenebrous world of procedural machinations,we think it preferable to address the gonzalez plaintiffs main arguments.as we discuss,the district court order was an appropriate exercise of its authority regardless of the status of the texas order.
the district court issued pto under the all writs act,which provides all courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.the power granted by the all writs act is limited by the act,which prohibits,with certain specified exceptions,injunctions by federal courts that have the effect of staying a state court proceeding.appellants contend the district court order was prohibited by the act.american home products and the brown plaintiffs claim the injunction falls under one of the act exceptions.we hold the district court order was not barred by the anti injunction act and was a valid exercise of its power under the all writs act.
the act prohibits most injunctions to stay proceedings in a state court.insofar as pto enjoined gonzalez class counsel,and those working in concert,from pursuing the opt out contemplated by the texas order,it operated to stay the proceedings in the hidalgo county court,if only indirectly.an order directed at the parties and their representatives,but not at the court itself,does not remove it from the scope of the act.it is settled that the prohibition of can not be evaded by addressing the order to the parties atl.coast line of locomotive eng rs,d.therefore,to the extent pto had the effect of staying the hidalgo county court proceedings,it was prohibited by the act,unless it fell within one of the act exceptions.
by its terms,the act allows such injunctions as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.none of the parties suggests the injunction was expressly authorized by an act of congress,or the injunction was aimed at protecting or effectuating a judgment of the district court accordingly,the injunction evades the act restrictions only if it was necessary in aid of its jurisdiction.
the exceptions in the act are to be construed narrowly.any doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed in an orderly fashion to finally determine the controversy.atl.coast,at.these exceptions are narrow and are not to be enlarged by loose statutory construction.chick kam choo,at.citation and alterations omitted prudential,at.
in atlantic coast,the court emphasized an order directed at a state court proceeding must be necessary in aid of jurisdiction it is not enough that the requested injunction is related to that jurisdiction.at.acknowledging the language is nonetheless broad,the court elaborated an injunction is necessary in aid of a court jurisdiction only if some federal injunctive relief may be necessary to prevent a state court from so interfering with a federal court consideration or disposition of a case as to seriously impair the federal court flexibility and authority to decide that case.id.
without more,it may not be sufficient that prior resolution of a state court action will deprive a federal court of the opportunity to resolve the merits of a parallel action in federal court.the traditional notion is that in personam actions in federal and state court may proceed concurrently,without interference from either court,and there is no evidence that the exception to was intended to alter this balance.vendo,d plurality opinion.in ordinary actions in personam,e ach court is free to proceed in its own way and in its own time,without reference to the proceedings in the other court.whenever a judgment is rendered in one of the courts and pleaded in the other,the effect of that judgment is to be determined by the application of the principle of res adjudicata by the court in which the action is still pending kline burke constr.therefore,it may not be sufficient that state actions risk some measure of inconvenience or duplicative litigation.in re,cir.an injunction may issue,however,where the state court action threatens to frustrate proceedings and disrupt the orderly resolution of the federal litigation.winkler eli lilly,cir.in other words,the state action must not simply threaten to reach judgment first,it must interfere with the federal court own path to judgment.
several factors are relevant to determine whether sufficient interference is threatened to justify an injunction otherwise prohibited by the act.first,we look to the nature of the federal action to determine what kinds of state court interference would sufficiently impair the federal proceeding.second,we assess the state court actions,in order to determine whether they present a sufficient threat to the federal action.and finally,we consider principles of federalism and comity,for a primary aim of the act is to prevent needless friction between the state and federal courts.packing.gas.
we turn first to the nature of the federal action.while,as noted,the necessary in aid of jurisdiction exception does not ordinarily permit injunctions merely to prevent duplicative actions in personam,federal courts are permitted to stay state court proceedings over the same res in actions in rem,because the exercise by the state court of jurisdiction over the same res necessarily impairs,and may defeat,the jurisdiction of the federal court already attached.kline,at.see also in re motors.truck fuel tank prods.liab,cir gm trucks ii.federal courts may also issue such injunctions to protect exclusive federal jurisdiction of a case that has been removed from state court.gm trucks ii,at.
we have recognized another category of federal cases for which state court actions present a special threat to the jurisdiction of the federal court.under an appropriate set of facts,a federal court entertaining complex litigation,especially when it involves a substantial class of persons from multiple states,or represents a consolidation of cases from multiple districts,may appropriately enjoin state court proceedings in order to protect its jurisdiction.carlough amchem,cir.carlough involved a nationwide class of plaintiffs and several manufacturers of insurance providers.we found the complexity of the case to be a substantial factor in justifying the injunction imposed.id.at.
implicit in carlough is the recognition that maintaining the federal court flexibility and authority to decide such complex nationwide cases makes special demands on the court that may justify an injunction otherwise prohibited by the act.several other courts have concurred see,hanlon chrysler,cir winkler,at t he act does not bar courts with jurisdiction over complex multidistrict litigation from issuing injunctions to protect the integrity of their rulings.wesch folsom,cir battle liberty life ins,cir,at in re corrugated container antitrust,cir.unit a approving injunction in a complicated antitrust action that has required a great deal of the district court time and has necessitated that it maintain a flexible approach in resolving the various claims of the many parties.in re healthcare.billing practices,d in re lease oil antitrust litig.no.ii,d,harris wells.in re asbestos sch,wl,aff,cir in re joint dist.asbestos.
this is not to say that class actions are,by virtue of that categorization alone,exempt from the general rule that in personam cases must be permitted to proceed in parallel.see in re glenn turner enters,cir.federal courts ordinarily refrain from enjoining a state action even where the state court is asked to approve a settlement substantially similar to one the federal court has already rejected.gm trucks ii,at.that a state court may resolve an issue first which may operate as res judicata,is not by itself a sufficient threat to the federal court jurisdiction that justifies an injunction,unless the proceedings in state courts threaten to frustrate proceedings and disrupt the orderly resolution of the federal litigation.winkler,at.still,while the potentially preclusive effects of the state action may not themselves justify an injunction,they might do so indirectly.if,for example,the possibility of an earlier state court judgment is disruptive to settlement negotiations in federal court,the existence of the state court action might sufficiently interfere with the federal court flexibility to justify an injunction.
the threat to the federal court jurisdiction posed by parallel state actions is particularly significant where there are conditional class certifications and impending settlements in federal actions.carlough,at.not the cases permitting injunctions in complex litigation cases involve injunctions issued as the parties approached settlement,carlough baldwin united,at corrugated container,at asbestos sch,wl,at joint dist.asbestos,at.but see winkler,at protecting effect of discovery ruling harris.at same.complex cases in the later,for instance,settlement negotiations are an enormous amount of time and expenditure of resources.it is in the nature of complex litigation that the parties often seek complicated,comprehensive settlements to resolve as many claims as possible in one proceeding.these cases are especially vulnerable to parallel state actions that may frustrate the district court efforts to craft a settlement in the litigation before it,carlough,at quoting,at,thereby destroying the ability to achieve the benefits of consolidation.in complex cases where certification or settlement has received conditional approval,or perhaps even where settlement is pending,the challenges facing the overseeing court are such that it is likely that almost any parallel litigation in other fora presents a genuine threat to the jurisdiction of the federal court.see id.
this case amply highlights these concerns.mdl represented the consolidation of over two thousand cases that had been filed in or removed to federal court.the brown class finally certified comprised six million members.the district court entered well over one thousand orders in the case.this massive consolidation enabled the possibility of a global resolution that promised to minimize the various difficulties associated with duplicative and competing lawsuits.the central events in this dispute occurred after two years of exhaustive work by the parties and the district court,and after a conditional class certification and preliminary settlement had been negotiated and approved by the district court.there can be no doubt that keeping this enormously complicated settlement process on track required careful management by the district court.any state court action that might interfere with the district court oversight of the settlement at that time,given the careful balancing it embodied,was a serious threat to the district court ability to manage the final stages of this complex litigation duplicative and competing actions were substantially more likely to frustrate proceedings and disrupt the orderly resolution of this dispute at the time pto was issued than they would be in ordinary actions in personam.winkler,at.this is especially true where,as here,the litigants in state court have the ability to tailor their state actions to the terms of the pending federal settlement.
determining the applicability of the carlough rule also requires assessment of the character of the state court action,for we must assess the level of interference with the federal action actually threatened by the state court proceeding.in carlough,our approval of the injunction was supported by the direct threat to the federal action the state court action represented.after the district court had provisionally certified the carlough class,and after a preliminary settlement had been negotiated and presented to the court,a parallel action was filed in west virginia.as here,the plaintiffs in that amchem products,an order of the state court opting out the members of the west virginia class from the federal class.at.they also sought a declaration that carlough would not be binding on the members of the west virginia class.id.at.
we viewed the filing of the west virginia action as an intentional preemptive strike against the federal action.id.at.the purpose of the west virginia filing was to challenge the propriety of the federal class action.id.we found it difficult to imagine a more detrimental effect upon the district court ability to effectuate the settlement of this complex and matter then would occur if the west virginia state court was permitted to make a determination regarding the validity of the federal settlement.id.at.
also significant in carlough was the threat posed by the attempt to secure a mass opt out.we noted that permitting a state court to issue such an order would be disruptive to the district court ongoing settlement management and would jeopardize the settlement fruition.id.additionally,we noted the confusion that would likely result among west virginia residents as to their status in the dueling lawsuits.id.all of this amounted to direct interference with the district court ability to manage the federal action effectively.
the interference that would have been caused by the hidalgo county court order implicates the same concerns that animated our decision in carlough.the texas court order directly affected the identity of the parties to mdl and did so contrary to a previous district court order.it sought to declare what the federal court should and should not do with respect to the federal settlement.gm trucks ii,at.furthermore,as in carlough,the texas order would have created confusion among those who were members of both the federal and the state classes.it would be difficult to discern which,if any,action one was a party to,especially since the texas order was entered during,and shortly before the end of,the mdl period.
attempting to distinguish their case from carlough,appellants contend their action can not be characterized as a preemptive strike against the federal action because the gonzalez action was filed before the creation of mdl.gm trucks ii,at distinguishing the state court action there at issue as not falling under this characterization.yet we do not believe a state court action must necessarily be a preemptive strike before meriting the carlough exception.the test,as always,is whether the state court proceeding so interfer es with a federal court consideration or disposition of a case as to seriously impair the federal court flexibility and authority to decide that case.atl.coast,at.of course,where a state court proceeding amounts to an attack on a federal action,we are more likely to find significant interference.we are also less likely to find that comity demands deference to the state court action.but there are any number of factors that may play a role,and we do not understand either carlough or gm trucks ii to hold that this element is necessary,in all cases,for application of the exception.
in any event,appellants attempt to distinguish carlough on this ground fails.while the relative timing of the filing of the actions makes clear that gonzalez was not filed as a preemptive strike on mdl,there is no doubt the motion requesting the texas court to opt gonzalez class members out of the brown class was a preemptive strike.the district court found it necessary to enjoin only the part of the action that by with the federal action 
because an injunction must be necessary in aid of jurisdiction to fall under this application to the anti injunction act,it is important to carefully tailor such injunctions to meet the needs of the case.notably,the relief we approved in carlough was substantially broader than the relief granted by the district court here.the federal order in carlough enjoined the west virginia plaintiffs,as well as their attorneys and representatives,from pursuing the gore action or initiating similar litigation in any other forum.at.the injunction in carlough effectively stayed the entire parallel state action,not only the attempted opt out,or other portions directed squarely at the federal action.here,by contrast,the district court order enjoined only the pursuit of the attempted mass opt part of gonzalez that unquestionably interfered with the management of mdl.it did not prevent the gonzalez plaintiffs from individually opting out.furthermore,the injunction was not directed at a proceeding in which plaintiffs had merely requested relief that threatened to interfere with the federal action,it was directed at a proceeding in which the state court had actually granted such a request,making the interference substantially more manifest.under these circumstances,we find the district court injunction to be well within its sound discretion.carlough,at.
the propriety of an injunction directed at the texas order is also consistent with considerations of federalism and comity.the texas plaintiffs who wished to opt out of the brown class were given an adequate opportunity to individually opt out of the federal action,a factor we found significant in carlough,at.as such,texas residents retained the option to commence lawsuits in the forum of their choice.id.at.furthermore,the injunction only prevented application of a particular order that was directed squarely at the federal action,at to the extent that the impending state court suits were vexatious and harassing,our interest in preserving federalism and comity with the state courts is not significantly disturbed by the issuance of injunctive relief.it did not so much interfere with the state court proceeding as prevent state court interference with the federal proceeding.failing to act on the hidalgo county order threatened to create the very needless friction between state and federal courts which the anti injunction act was designed to prevent.winkler,at quoting.packing,at.while the act is designed to avoid disharmony between federal and state systems,the exception in reflects congressional recognition that injunctions may sometimes be necessary in order to avoid that disharmony.amalgamated sugar nl,cir.
the district court order clearly falls under the necessary in aid of its jurisdiction exception to the act.the complexity of this multidistrict class action in its mature a provisionally certified class and preliminarily approved that the district court required flexibility to bring the case to judgment.the nature of the texas order was such that the required flexibility and eventual resolution were directly threatened.finally,the principle embodied in the anti injunction act that federal courts maintain respect for state court proceedings is not undermined by the issuance of the injunction.
our holding that pto was necessary in aid of the district court jurisdiction for purposes of the anti injunction act necessarily implies it was authorized under the all writs act as well.for the all writs act grants federal courts the authority to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of a court jurisdiction.a.insofar as it also permits writs appropriate in aid of jurisdiction,the court authority to issue writs is,if anything,broader than the exception contained in the act.but since t he parallel necessary in aid of jurisdiction language is construed similarly in both the all writs act and the act,a finding that an injunction is necessary in aid of jurisdiction for purposes of one these statutes implies its necessity for purposes of the other.prudential,at carlough,at.accordingly,the district court was empowered to issue pto under the all writs act,and was not prevented from doing so by the act.
full faith and credit act.
as noted,the hidalgo county court order opting out texas class members supported a finding that its action sufficiently interfered with mdl to justify application of an exception to the act.but appellants contend the texas order invoked the protections of the full faith and credit act.once issued,they argue,the order was entitled to full faith and credit,foreclosing the district court authority to issue a contrary order,even if permitted under the act.
the full faith and credit act provides,the judicial proceedings of any court of any state shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the united states as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state from which they are taken.
where applicable,the act directs all courts to treat a state court judgment with the same respect that it would receive in the courts of the rendering state.matsushita indus.epstein,d.under texas law,c ollateral estoppel will bar relitigation of an issue if the facts sought to be litigated in the first action were fully and fairly litigated in the prior action,those facts were essential to the judgment in the first action,and the parties were cast as adversaries in the first action.texacadian energy,lone star energy storage,christi.but i nterlocutory orders on matters that are simply collateral or incidental to the main suit do not operate as res judicata or collateral estoppel.id.the trial court retains continuing control over interlocutory orders and has the power to set those orders aside any time before a final judgment is entered.fruehauf carrillo.
