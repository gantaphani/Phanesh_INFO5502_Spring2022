defendant usa,mbusa appeals from a judgment in favor of plaintiff azubueze jiagbogu in an action for breach of express and implied warranties under the consumer warranty act act.all further statutory references are to the civil code unless otherwise specified.mbusa argues the trial court erred by not instructing on waiver of right to rescind,on statutory offsets for postrescission use of a product,on the presumption under section,subdivision b,and on other matters.mbusa also argues the trial court should have awarded it an equitable offset for jiagbogu use of his car after he requested a replacement or refund from mbusa.
we hold that the right of a vehicle buyer under the consumer warranty act to compel a manufacturer to reimburse the purchase price or replace the vehicle is distinct from a rescission that the manufacturer is not entitled to an offset for use of the vehicle except where that remedy is authorized by the statute and that the trial court should not instruct on the presumption that the manufacturer has had an adequate opportunity to correct defects in the vehicle where the conditions for claiming the presumption are not shown by the evidence,and the buyer does not assert it.finding no error,we affirm.

discussion 
mbusa argues the trial court should have instructed the jury that jiagbogu continued use of the car after he requested replacement or restitution could have waived his right to rescind.in a related argument,mbusa claims the court should have instructed that jiagbogu use of the car after his buyback request entitled mbusa to an offset against jiagbogu damages under section.
under the act,a buyer who discovers a nonconformity in a manufacturer goods shall deliver the nonconforming goods to a repair facility maintained by the manufacturer within the state,subd.c.if the nonconforming product is a new motor vehicle and the manufacturer is unable to service or repair the vehicle to conform to applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts,the manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new motor vehicle or promptly make restitution to the buyer,subd.d.the buyer may elect restitution in lieu of replacement,subd.d.
mbusa contends that jiagbogu request for restitution amounted to a rescission.but section does not refer to rescission or any portion of the commercial code that discusses rescission.the act does not parallel the commercial code it provides different and more extensive consumer protections.krotin porsche cars north america,th,d krotin.jiagbogu did not invoke rescission,or any of the common law doctrines or commercial code provisions relating to that remedy.it would not matter if he had referred to rescission in his buyback request,as long as he sought a remedy only under the act,which contains no provision requiring formal rescission to obtain relief.see krotin,at,d.mbusa acknowledges in its brief that jiagbogu requested refund or replacement.that comports with a claim under the act,not with a traditional cause of action for rescission.
mbusa cites ibrahim ford motor d.ibrahim,for its argument that continued use after a request for buyback can constitute waiver of the right to rescind.in ibrahim,the plaintiff filed a verified complaint for rescission,restitution and damages,breach of express and implied warranties,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation under the act,the california uniform commercial code ucc,and a federal consumer protection statute.ibrahim,at.in considering whether continued use waived the right to revoke acceptance under the ucc,the ibrahim court discussed the nationwide consensus that reasonable continued use of motorized vehicles does not,as a matter of law,prevent the buyer from asserting rescission or its equivalent,revocation of acceptance.id.at.as part of this consensus,the court explained that a seller is entitled to a setoff for the buyer use after revocation of acceptance.the court held that n othing in the language of either the ucc or the act suggests that abrogation of the common law principles relating to continued use and waiver of a buyer right to rescind was intended the legal principles governing continued use are thus still applicable.id.at.
ibrahim did not hold that waiver of the right to rescind applies to actions brought solely under the act.nor did it rule that any analogous common law principle applies to or limits the act.rather,the court held that the act did not abrogate common law principles applying to causes of action brought under the ucc.by including a cause of action for rescission and invoking the ucc in her complaint,ibrahim invoked the common law doctrines of waiver of right to rescind and seller offset for buyer use after revocation of acceptance.ibrahim,supra,d at.jiagbogu,who filed claims only under the act,did not.
mbusa contends that regardless of the language in the act,section describes a rescission that should be subject to common law and ucc rules for rescission.in practice,a consumer usually will have to request replacement or restitution
