in,larry storie bought a truck that had been involved in a fatal accident the previous year.claiming that he had been misled about the truck history,he brought suit against a number of companies that had owned the truck between the time of the accident and his purchase of it.the present case concerns storie lawsuit against randy auto sales,llc.he alleges that randy failed to apply for a salvage title,as it was required to do under indiana law.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of randy,finding that e does not require an entity that acquired a wrecked vehicle to apply for a salvage title when it no longer owns the vehicle upon the receipt of the certificate of title.because this case turns on the interpretation of an ambiguous state statute,we certify the case to the supreme court of indiana.
background 
on november,the driver of a western star truck was killed in indiana when the freight he was carrying shifted forward and pierced the cab.the truck was declared a total loss and purchased by its insurer,paul mercury insurance company.paul applied for a tennessee certificate of title as proof of its ownership,but did not apply for a salvage title.
before tennessee issued the title to paul,the truck changed hands several times in quick succession.on january,paul sold the truck to randy,an car dealer,which in turn sold the vehicle nine days later to west side auto parts.west side brought the truck to its headquarters in owensboro,kentucky.the next month,on february,west side sold the vehicle to duckett truck center,in farmington,missouri.
after these transactions,but before the truck was finally sold to plaintiff storie,tennessee issued a certificate of title to paul on march.on or about april,paul sent the title to randy,which duly forwarded the title to west side,which in turn passed it over to duckett.none of these entities applied for a salvage title.
on june,duckett sold the truck to storie,an illinois resident,who applied for an illinois title on the truck.after driving the truck for more than eighteen months and thousand miles,storie claims that he learned of the vehicle involvement in a fatal accident for the first time.on august,storie brought suit against paul,randy,west side and duckett in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri.storie voluntarily dismissed his claims against randy and west side for lack of personal jurisdiction.he then refiled his claims against randy and west side in the united states district court for the southern district of indiana.
the present case concerns storie action against randy only.he contends that randy violated e,which provides 
any other person acquiring a wrecked or damaged motor vehicle,motorcycle,semitrailer,or recreational vehicle that meets at least one of the criteria set forth in section of this chapter,which acquisition is not evidenced by a certificate of salvage title,shall apply to the bureau within days after receipt of the certificate of title for a certificate of salvage title 
storie argues that randy acquired the truck on january,when it purchased the vehicle from paul.he submits further that randy lack of continuing ownership at the time it received the certificate of title is of no moment.storie thus contends that the provisions of e were triggered and that randy failure to apply for a salvage title violated the statute.
the district court was not convinced.it held that randy had no obligation under indiana law to obtain a salvage title,opining that b y the time it received the title from paul,it no longer owned the truck,and therefore could not have obtained any indiana title for it.storie randy auto sales,llc,wl,at.it thus granted summary judgment in favor of randy.id.in doing so,however,the court noted that its holding is not necessarily consistent with the presumed purpose of the salvage title requirement,which is to protect consumers against the risks associated with purchasing previously wrecked vehicles without knowledge of their history.id.at.nevertheless,the court felt unable to impose a statutory duty where none exists.id.
in its opinion,the district court omitted reference to four arguments advanced by randy in its motion for summary judgment,namely that indiana salvage title applies only to vehicles that will be owned and operated within indiana,that indiana law would follow the law of the titling state,that insurance companies are gatekeepers upon whom dealers can legally rely and that e does not apply to dealers.
storie now appeals from the entry of summary judgment against him.
ii.discussion 
summary judgment is proper only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see petts rockledge furniture llc,cir.to the extent we are called upon to review the district court interpretation of a statute,the standard of review is likewise de novo.see boyd illinois state police,cir.
a.the application of e to randy 
does e reference to any other person capture a former owner that sells a salvage vehicle before it receives the certificate of title according to storie,it is immaterial whether an entity that acquired a wrecked vehicle actually owns it upon receipt of the title.its obligation to apply for a certificate of salvage title remains unaffected.the district court,in contrast,found that a lack of continuing ownership absolves an acquiring person of any obligation to apply for a salvage title when it receives the certificate of title.
e is not a model of clarity.literally,its command that a ny other person acquiring a wrecked or damaged motor vehicle shall apply to the bureau after receipt of the certificate of title for a certificate of salvage title might capture current and former owners alike,as long as they once acquired the vehicle.section makes no explicit reference to an ongoing requirement of ownership.yet,a variety of arguments suggests that former owners might nevertheless be exempt.
competing interpretations of the statute lead us to conclude that it is ambiguous and that it should be certified to the indiana supreme court pursuant to our circuit rule.we consider the reasoning that supports the district court conclusion before considering that which opposes it.
there are a number of reasonable arguments that the obligations imposed by e are limited to current owners.
first,states that the bureau will issue a certificate of salvage title as proof of ownership.this might suggest that an entity can not or should not apply for such a certificate if it no longer owns the salvage vehicle when it receives the certificate of title.indeed,section only allows the acquiring insurance company,disposal facility,or person to apply for a certificate of salvage title.if the vehicle has been subsequently sold to a new party,it is not entirely clear how the former owner can then be characterized as the acquiring party.
second,being a present participle,acquiring implies that the legislature envisioned some form of simultaneity between the act of acquiring a salvage vehicle and receiving the certificate of title this might suggest that indiana never intended for companies that acquire salvage vehicles to be bound by e if they receive the certificates of title after they have sold the vehicles.
third,and perhaps most importantly,the indiana court of appeals has held that acquisition denotes ownership.see larkin body shop,at.if these terms are in fact synonymous,then e requires any other person owning a wrecked or damaged motor vehicle to apply for a salvage title within days of receiving the certificate of title.if a person does not own the vehicle when she receives the title,then she would not be obliged to apply for a salvage title.
before proceeding,a few words of caution are in order.one might be tempted to look to the section purported title for guidance.after all,the supreme court has observed that the title of a section can clarify ambiguities in the legislation text.see ins national center for immigrants rights,d the official title on the website is application by insurer or owner for certificate
