plaintiff greg donlen appeals from the trial court grant of a new trial following a jury verdict awarding him damages in his lemon law action against defendant ford motor company ford.he claims the court committed no error at trial and thus had no jurisdiction to grant a new trial on that basis.ford also appeals,asserting that if we reverse the new trial order,we should reverse the judgment on the basis of lack of substantial evidence and evidentiary error.we conclude the trial court erred in granting a new trial,and we reverse its order.we also affirm the judgment and reject ford appeal.
plaintiff purchased a new ford f super duty truck in july.the truck was covered by an express limited warranty for a period of three years or miles,whichever came first.
repair history 
plaintiff took the truck to a dealer four times during the warranty period to have it repaired or checked for problems.the first warranty repair,in august of at miles,occurred pursuant to a recall notice plaintiff received from ford.the recall concerned the truck transmission.the notice stated t he torqshift transmission in your vehicle may have a gear set pinion shaft s that may become loose,causing metallic particle contamination.if this condition occurs,it may lead to shifts engagements.
for this repair,the technician removed and disassembled the truck transmission.he determined a planetary pin,a pin used to hold a gear in place,had come out.he made the repair as required by the recall,and he reassembled and installed the transmission.
the truck second visit to the dealer during the warranty period occurred approximately two months later in october at miles.this visit was also the result of a recall notice.the recall concerned components in the engine.an exhaust pressure sensor was experiencing corrosion,and the onboard diagnostic system may not have been properly monitoring the performance of the emissions control systems.
for this repair,the technician installed a newly designed exhaust pressure sensor and reprogrammed various control modules,including the transmission control module,to enhance the function of the onboard diagnostic and other systems.the transmission control module was reprogrammed to reflect and coordinate with updates made in the power control module,the main computer on the vehicle.
the truck third visit to the dealer during the warranty period occurred one month later in november at miles.plaintiff complained that when he was driving downhill and he put the truck into mode,it felt like the transmission went into neutral before it would downshift,and it would not upshift he said this happened whether or not he was pulling a trailer.on one occasion,when he came to a stop,the transmission went into neutral and would not accelerate for a moment before it engaged.
the technician and the service manager took the truck on road tests to see if they could duplicate the problem with the truck in mode.they could not,and they found no problem with it.
the truck fourth visit to the dealer during the warranty period occurred approximately four months later in march at miles.plaintiff complained the truck made what he described as a loud thunk when the transmission engaged in reverse.he also complained the transmission intermittently acted like it wanted to go into neutral when it was in mode,or it intermittently engaged in mode by itself.
the technician verified plaintiff concerns.the transmission had reverse and forward engagement.it also intermittently would not upshift from first gear to second gear.after replacing a shift solenoid the technician tested the truck and found it still had the intermittent shift problem from first to second gears.he replaced the power control module.that fixed the problem somewhat,but he noticed the truck still intermittently delayed when shifted into reverse.ultimately,based on directions he received from ford,the technician removed and tore down the transmission.he found that a lip seal was coming apart on the reverse piston drum.he replaced the drum and reassembled and installed the transmission.his road test of the truck was successful.
after this last repair,plaintiff did not hear the thunk noise.plaintiff made no complaints to ford up to and beyond the limited warranty expiration.the limited warranty expired no later than july,some months after the last warranty repair was performed.
in july,at miles,plaintiff took his truck to the dealer.at this point,plaintiff truck had been out of warranty for at least one year,and plaintiff had driven it for months and over miles since the last repair.on this occasion,plaintiff complained the truck once again made a thunk noise and he was unable to put it into reverse.he also stated the light was flashing.he had experienced these problems for three weeks prior to bringing the truck in for repair.
the technician verified plaintiff complaints.the transmission had a long engagement in all gears,and the transmission fluid was dark.the technician tore down the transmission and discovered the reverse clutch piston a seal was leaking and its edge was worn off.he overhauled the transmission and installed it into the truck.the repair cost plaintiff approximately.
by letter dated august,plaintiff demanded ford repurchase his f truck pursuant to california lemon law,the song beverly consumer warranty act,et the act.ford refused,and plaintiff filed this action.plaintiff alleged ford breached the express limited warranty as well as implied warranties of merchantability and fitness.he demanded rescission and restitution,along with damages and a civil penalty.
ford filed two in limine motions at issue here.the first,in limine motion,sought to exclude evidence of any other vehicle other than plaintiff truck.the second,in limine motion,sought to exclude all evidence of the july repair.ford argued evidence of other vehicles and the repair was inadmissible because it was irrelevant under evidence code section and unduly prejudicial under evidence code section.the court denied both motions,and the jury received evidence of other similar vehicles and the repair.
plaintiff expert witness,james hughes,testified the problems addressed by the repair were similar to the problems addressed by the warranty repairs ford had overhauled the transmission previously for a similar problem.it was inconceivable to him for a transmission that had no design defects and had been repaired properly to go belly up in miles,as a properly designed and maintained transmission would in a heartbeat go a hundred thousand miles or more.he stated the transmission had not been fixed by any of the repairs it underwent.in his opinion,each repair was only a repair,and the repair related back to one of the original repairs.
hughes believed the transmission was defective before plaintiff bought the truck.he stated the transmission installed in plaintiff truck was known in the automotive repair industry as problematic.he based these opinions on the fact that ford had issued a special service message to dealers in march,some four months before plaintiff bought the truck,informing them the transmission could experience engagements,upshifts downshifts if its adaptive shift strategy was temporarily lost hughes also derived his opinion from speaking with personnel at two independent transmission shops,a ford dealer,and two research facilities,the automatic transmission rebuilders association and an entity named transco.
ford issued other notices to dealers concerning problems with this transmission.in august,about the time ford issued its first recall,it issued a technical service bulletin noting trucks with this transmission could experience harsh shifting.it recommended technicians reprogram the power control module to remedy this.
in july,about the time the warranty expired on plaintiff truck,ford issued another technical service bulletin concerning the transmission.according to this bulletin,this transmission may exhibit erratic shifts at certain speeds,an engagement shudder when shifting from drive to reverse or reverse to drive,and what ford described as a downshift clunk while coasting to a stop.the bulletin stated these concerns might be caused by the power control module or transmission control module calibration.
hughes test drove the truck a few months before trial.the shifting was a little harsh,and when he put it in reverse,he heard a loud bang.it happened two or three other times during the test.he also heard what he called a clunk once while coming to a stop.the function worked fine,the computer sensor showed no trouble codes,and he found no metal in the transmission fluid.the lack of trouble codes did not mean there was no problem the bangs and clunks indicated there was a problem.
plaintiff noticed the transmission continued to act up after hughes test drive.the noise was occurring more often,and it was happening while the car was in drive.
the jury considered only plaintiff express warranty claim,the trial court apparently having granted ford motion for a nonsuit on the implied warranty claims.the jury found for plaintiff.it concluded ford failed to repair the truck to match the written warranty after a reasonable number of opportunities to do so.it awarded plaintiff restitution damages of,incidental damages of,and a civil penalty of.
posttrial motions 
ford moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov and a new trial.in its jnov motion,ford claimed plaintiff failed to produce substantial evidence showing his truck had a defect covered by the warranty that impaired the truck use,or that ford failed to repair any defect covered by the warranty.
in its motion for new trial,ford claimed plaintiff failed to produce substantial evidence showing his truck was substantially impaired or that ford failed to repair the vehicle to match the written warranty.ford also claimed the trial court committed an error in law when it denied ford in limine motion and allowed plaintiff to introduce evidence of the july repair.
the trial court denied the jnov motion.it found sufficient evidence supported the jury verdict.
however,the trial court granted the new trial motion.it ruled it had made an error of law in denying ford in limine motion and in allowing plaintiff to introduce evidence of the july repair.it found the alleged error of law in the admission of the july repair visit confused and misled the jury and resulted in undue prejudice to defendant ford.
the court wrote plaintiff did not report to ford any further problems with his truck after the february repair during the balance of the warranty period.it was not until july,at miles about one year and miles after the expiration of the written warranty that plaintiff took his truck to the local ford dealership for additional transmission repairs.he testified he began experiencing problems with the transmission about three weeks before it was taken to the shop and he has continued to have problems with the transmission following the repair.plaintiff truck was driven over miles during the months between the fourth warranty repair and the subject repair in july.the fact plaintiff experienced transmission problems in july at miles constitutes marginal evidence,if any,that ford breached the written warranty during the applicable warranty period.introduction of this evidence likely led the jury to conclude the fourth warranty repair in february failed to repair a defect in the transmission.the court,over defendant objection,erroneously allowed into evidence testimony concerning the july repairs.this evidence is highly prejudicial to defendant and warrants a new trial.original italics.
plaintiff appeals.he contends the trial court erred in granting ford motion for new trial.he asserts the court did not err in denying ford in limine motion and in admitting evidence of the july repair because,among other arguments,the evidence was relevant and it was not unduly prejudicial.he also disagrees with ford assertion that the court granted a new trial on the basis of lack of substantial evidence 
ford also appeals.it contends that in the event we reverse the trial court new trial order,we should reverse the judgment in favor of plaintiff or at least remand for new trial due to a lack of substantial evidence supporting the judgment and because the court denial of ford in limine motions was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
discussion 
iplaintiff appeal from the order granting a new trial 
plaintiff claims the trial court abused its discretion by granting a new trial.he contends there was no error in law on which the court could grant a new trial because its denial of ford in limine motion was not error.he also argues we can not affirm the new trial order on the ground of lack of substantial evidence,as the court did not specify that as a ground for granting the motion.we agree with plaintiff on both points,and we reverse the trial court order.
standard of review 
where a new trial is granted on the basis of legal error,we must first determine whether the ruling the trial court claims was made in error is as a matter of law truly error.it is true that,as a general matter,orders granting a new trial are examined for abuse of discretion.citations.but it is also true that any determination underlying any order is scrutinized under the test appropriate to such determination.citations.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.if there were no legal errors at trial,the order granting a new trial on the basis of error in law will be reversed.treber superior court cal d.a trial court has no discretion to grant a new trial on the basis of error in law unless its original ruling was erroneous as a matter of law.ramirez usaa casualty ins.d.

the determination underlying the trial court order granting a new trial was the asserted error in denying ford in limine motion,where it concluded evidence of the repair was not unduly prejudicial.rulings regarding relevancy and evidence code section are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.people lee cal th.we thus apply that standard to determine whether the court erred in denying ford in limine motion.
error in law in admitting evidence of repair 
the issue raised by the complaint was whether ford had repaired the truck to conform to the express warranty.if it had not after a reasonable number of attempts to do so,the act required ford to replace the truck or make restitution.the pertinent provision of the act,civil code section,subd.d,states if the manufacturer or its representative in this state is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts,the manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new motor vehicle or promptly make restitution to the buyer 
ford contended evidence of the repair was not relevant to this issue or,even if relevant,was unduly prejudicial.the trial court originally disagreed with ford,finding the evidence relevant and not unduly prejudicial.we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion when it made this ruling.

ford contends the repair evidence was not relevant because there was no evidence the repair was causally related to the warranty repairs or that it was for the same defect.ford claims that for repair evidence to be relevant in this case,plaintiff must show the evidence relates to warranty repairs or to the same defect previously repaired under warranty.ford calls this requirement obvious,although it cites no authority to support its position.
the court did not abuse its discretion in determining evidence of the repair was relevant.the evidence has a tendency to establish that the transmission was not fully repaired in conformance with the express warranty.prior to the expiration of the warranty,the transmission was torn out,disassembled,repaired,and reassembled twice.for the repair,the transmission was disassembled a third time,and,as in the last warranty repair,the repair uncovered a deteriorating seal.the evidence is relevant to establishing the transmission was not repaired to match the warranty while the warranty was in effect.
ford argues allowing evidence of repairs extends the term of its warranty to whatever limit an expert is willing to testify.we disagree.evidence that a problem was fixed for a period of time but reappears at a later date is relevant to determining whether a fundamental problem in the vehicle was ever resolved.jensen bmw of north america,th.indeed,that a defect first appears after a warranty has expired does not necessarily mean the defect did not exist when the product was purchased.mexia rinker boat,th.repair evidence may be admitted on a case by case basis where it is relevant to showing the vehicle was not repaired to conform to the warranty during the warranty existence.
ford standard of relevance is too strict for purposes of the act.the act is a remedial measure intended for protection of consumers and should be given a construction consistent with that purpose.robertson fleetwood travel trailers of california,th.as a result,the plaintiff is not obligated to identify or prove the car defect.rather,he is required only to prove the car did not conform to the express warranty.oregel american isuzu motors,th,fn.oregel.the repair,affecting the transmission for a third time and a worn seal for a second time,tends to show the truck did not conform to the express warranty after the last warranty repair and thus was relevant.plaintiff was not required to show a closer causal relationship in order for the evidence to survive an objection based on relevance.
unduly prejudicial 
having originally concluded the evidence was relevant,the trial court next determined the repair evidence was not unduly prejudicial.evidence code section vests a trial court with discretion to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will create substantial danger of undue prejudice,of confusing the issues,or of misleading the jury.ford contends the court erred,as the evidence was of little probative value,and its remoteness from the last warranty repair would confuse the issues and mislead the jury.
this court has noted that t he prejudice which exclusion of evidence under evidence code section is designed to avoid is not the prejudice or damage to a defense that naturally flows from relevant,highly probative evidence.a ll evidence which tends to prove guilt is prejudicial or damaging to the defendant case.the stronger the evidence,the more it is prejudicial.the prejudice referred to in evidence code section applies to evidence which uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against the defendant as an individual and which has very little effect on the issues.people karis cal d,see vorse sarasy th.people escudero th,italics added escudero.
next,we look to the plain language of evidence code section and the sometimes overlooked words,substantially and substantial danger.evidence is not inadmissible under evidence code section unless the probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability of a substantial danger of undue prejudice or other statutory counterweights.our high court has emphasized the word substantial in evidence code section.people tran cal th,but evidence code section requires the exclusion of evidence only when its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.people geier cal th.
trial courts enjoy broad discretion in deciding whether the probability of a substantial danger of prejudice substantially outweighs probative value.people michaels cal th,people perry cal th,see people memro cal th.a trial court exercise of discretion will not be disturbed except on a showing the trial court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary,capricious,or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.people rodriguez cal th.people holford th,fn.omitted,original italics.
we can not say the trial court admission of the repair evidence was so arbitrary or patently absurd it resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.the court was within its discretion when it determined the evidence probative value was not substantially outweighed by its probability of creating undue prejudice or confusing the issues.we disagree with ford assertion that the evidence was of little probative value.the evidence was admitted to show the truck needed a repair after the warranty expired that was similar to one the truck underwent before the warranty expired,and it tended to show the truck transmission had not been repaired to conform to the warranty during the warranty period.
ford argues the evidence would confuse the jury because plaintiff failed to connect the repair to the last warranty repair.we disagree with this assertion as well,for the repair by its nature is connected to the last warranty repair.the transmission had been overhauled twice while under warranty,and the overhaul was caused by a similar malfunction as that which necessitated the second overhaul.plaintiff expert testimony that the repairs were related certainly was damaging to ford,but it would not invoke a uniquely emotional bias to the jurors against ford unrelated to the evidence relevance.its force did not create confusion.under the facts of this case,the possibility that the evidence of the repair could confuse the issues or mislead the jury did not substantially outweigh the evidence probative value.
because the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied ford in limine motion and admitted the repair evidence,it did not commit an error in law,and,thus,it did not have discretion to grant a new trial on that basis.
insufficient evidence as ground for new trial 
ford asserts that error in law was not the only basis for the trial court grant of a new trial.it contends the court also granted a new trial on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence,one of the statutory grounds upon which a court is authorized to grant a new trial.code civ.we are required to affirm an order granting a new trial if it should have been granted upon any statutory ground stated in the motion,with one exception applicable here.we may not affirm the order on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence unless such ground is stated in the order granting the motion code civ.
here,the trial court order does not state it granted the new trial motion on the ground of insufficient evidence.rather,it states it granted the motion due to an error in law namely,the admission of unduly prejudicial evidence.because the order does not specifically state it is granted based on insufficiency of the evidence,we can not affirm the order on that basis.code of civ.the right to move for a new trial is a creature of statute and the procedure prescribed by law must be closely followed.citation.collins sutter memorial hospital th.
ford contends the court effectively stated it granted the motion on the ground of insufficient evidence.it bases this assertion on the court statement that the fact plaintiff experienced transmission problems in july at miles constitutes marginal evidence,if any,that ford breached the written warranty during the applicable
