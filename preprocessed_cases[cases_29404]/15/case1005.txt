in this second appeal between these two parties we are asked to decide if roofing shingles purchased by pacific coast roofing hereinafter pacific pursuant to a contract to an existing dwelling for james atkinson are consumer goods under the trade commission improvement act,stat,et hereinafter.in addition,we must decide whether atkinson claim for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability under is barred by the statute of limitations.
facts and proceedings below 
on august,atkinson contracted with pacific to his family home.atkinson chose prestique i shingles manufactured by elk as the roofing material.the brochure in which the shingles were advertised contained the following language when you upgrade to prestique i high definition,you get the protection and durability to match the beauty.elk limited warranty covers both labor and shingles,plus you get a limited wind warranty.the last page of the brochure contained a comparison chart of elk products,including the applicable limited warranties.the warranty for the prestique i shingles stated that it was years years wind.however,the brochure did not contain any disclaimers or other limitations and atkinson did not see or receive any other warranty.when atkinson went to the building supply facility from where the shingles were purchased,there was no other limited warranty on display,nor was he given one based on the written warranty he saw in the brochure,atkinson instructed pacific to use elk prestique i shingles to his home.atkinson paid pacific for the work.included in that price was the cost of the shingles 
in january,while cleaning the gutters in his roof,atkinson noticed cracks in many of shingles.immediately,he contacted pacific.pacific contacted elk.in february,elk telephoned atkinson requesting a copy of the contract between atkinson and pacific.atkinson faxed the contract that same day.
in march,brian woods from elk called atkinson to set up an appointment to visit atkinson home in order to take a sample of the damaged shingles to be tested and evaluated by elk.the analysis conducted by elk revealed that the shingles were defective and had to be replaced.
in april,atkinson received a letter and check from elk for.atkinson called elk and spoke to kim gutierrez.he asked gutierrez to explain how elk arrived at that number.in may,atkinson received a letter from gutierrez explaining that the was a prorated amount for materials and labor for the shingles applied to his roof in.atkinson did not respond to gutierrez letter until november,he wrote to gutierrez to dispute the settlement amount and return the check.he explained that the settlement amount did not cover the actual cost of materials and labor in his geographic area.
gutierrez responded on december.included with her letter was the original check that atkinson had returned,and a copy of a lengthy document entitled limited warranty.atkinson had never seen this limited warranty before.between december and april,atkinson sought the aid of a consumer legal advocate from a local television station to help his efforts to resolve this matter with elk.
on april,atkinson left a message for linda frazier,an elk field service representative.on april,bonnie dlabaj,an elk technical administrative assistant,telephoned atkinson and informed him that frazier was out and that the case was closed.atkinson asked that frazier call him the following monday.
on april,frazier called to say she would reevaluate the settlement.she asked atkinson to obtain three bids to reroof his home.she asked that the bids be broken down to include the individual costs for tear off,materials and labor.in addition,she requested that the roofers not be allowed to see the roof before they bid.atkinson obtained three bids as requested.
on july,atkinson sent a letter to frazier with the three bids,which ranged from a low bid of to a high bid of.
on august,atkinson received a letter from frazier offering the same refund as before.frazier stated that according to the terms of the limited warranty,atkinson was not entitled to the cost associated with of the defective shingles,flashings,nails,stuccowork,or any other related costs of replacing the shingles.
atkinson filed a complaint on december,against elk and lyle thomas doing business as pacific coast roofing.the first cause of action alleged breach of express warranty under the consumer warranty act hereinafter,et against elk.the second cause of action alleged breach of implied warranty under against elk.the third cause of action alleged violation of the consumers legal remedies act,et against elk and pacific 
on april,atkinson filed a motion to amend the complaint to add two causes of action under a cause of action for fraud and a cause of action for violations of the unfair practices act.bus,et at the same time,he moved to continue the trial.
shortly thereafter,elk filed a combined opposition to atkinson motion to amend and to continue the trial.on may,the court denied both of atkinson motions.on may,the trial court heard and ruled on the various pending motions.after considering the argument of counsel,conducting research and,pursuant to the facts as stipulated by both atkinson and elk on its own motion,the trial court ruled that atkinson was not a buyer of consumer goods within the meaning of.as such,he did not have standing to assert his two remaining causes of action thereby entitling elk to nonsuit.
atkinson appealed the trial court ruling.on june,this court issued a published opinion that upheld the trial court ruling that atkinson was not a buyer of consumer goods,reasoning that roof shingles are not consumer goods within the meaning of.atkinson elk,supra,th at,d.however,we reversed the trial court ruling that denied atkinson the right to file an amended complaint to add allegations under.id.at,d.
subsequently,on may,atkinson filed a second amended complaint that included four causes of action.the first cause of action was for breach of express warranty under.the second cause of action was for breach of implied warranty under.the third cause of action was for fraud.finally,the fourth cause of action was for unlawful and deceptive practices under business and professions code section.
on july,elk filed a motion for summary judgment or in the alternative summary adjudication contending that the roofing material purchased from elk as part of the reroofing of atkinson house were not consumer goods within the meaning of.as to atkinson second cause of action for breach of implied warranty,elk argued that it was barred by the statute of limitations.
on october,the trial court heard argument on elk summary judgment motion.the court granted elk motion as to the first two causes of action,but allowed the third and fourth causes of action to go forward.as to the first cause of action,commissioner irwin reasoned that because the contract was for a lump sum with no separate charge for materials,and the shingles were incorporated into a dwelling,the shingles were not consumer goods under.as to the second cause of action,commissioner irwin reasoned that it was barred because the breach occurred after the expiration of the one year implied warranty period governed by civil code section.
thereafter,on february,atkinson filed a voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the third cause of action for fraud and fourth cause of action for violation of business and professions code section 
the court entered judgment on april.atkinson filed his notice of appeal on june.atkinson raises two issues on appeal.first,he contends that roofing shingles are consumer goods under.second,he contends that his breach of the implied warranty of merchantability claim under is not barred by the statute of limitations.we agree with atkinson first contention,but disagree with the second.accordingly,we will reverse the summary adjudication of atkinson breach of express warranty cause of action and remand for further proceedings.
discussion 
in his first assignment of error,atkinson argues that the roofing materials he purchased as part of the contract with pacific are consumer goods under.
as noted,the trial court granted elk motion as to atkinson first cause of action under,reasoning that because atkinson contract with pacific was for a lump sum with no separate charge for materials,and the shingles were incorporated into a dwelling,the shingles were not consumer goods under.
any party to an action may move for summary adjudication.code civ,subd.f.the object of the summary adjudication procedure is to expedite litigation by eliminating the unnecessary trial of claims.see,catalano superior court th,d summary adjudication,aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,summary judgment.
a motion for summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action,an affirmative defense,a claim for damages,or an issue of duty.code civ,subd.f.to dispose of a cause of action,the moving party must show that it has no merit.code civ,subd.p.a cause of action has no merit if either of the following exists one or more of the elements of the cause of action can not be separately established,even if that element is separately pleaded.a defendant establishes an affirmative defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.o.

to the extent that the decision turns on factual questions,the trial court assesses the evidence in light of the parties respective burdens.ultimately,the moving party bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.initially,however,the movant carries the lighter burden of production,which requires only a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact ibid.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.no more is called for.id.at,d.a burden of production entails only the presentation of evidence.citation.a burden of persuasion,however,entails the establish ment through such evidence of a requisite degree of belief.citation.id.at,d.
if the moving party makes the necessary initial prima facie showing,the burden of production shifts to the opposing party to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.code civ,subd.p see,aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.if the party opposing summary adjudication presents evidence demonstrating the existence of a disputed material fact,the motion must be denied.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.
throughout this process,the court must consider all of the evidence and all of the inferences drawn therefrom.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.the moving party evidence is strictly construed,while that of the opponent is liberally construed.id.at,d.

unlike,which allows only a buyer of consumer goods to bring an action,permits a consumer to bring an action for damages and other relief when a warrantor breaches its obligations under a warranty or under the act.d.the term consumer includes not only a buyer other than for purposes of resale of any consumer product,but also any person to whom such product is transferred during the duration of an implied or written warranty or service contract applicable to the product,and any other person who is entitled by the terms of such warranty or service contract or under applicable state law to enforce against the warrantor or service contractor the obligations of the warranty or service contract.
defines a consumer product as any tangible personal property which is distributed in commerce and which is normally used for personal,family,or household purposes including any such property intended to be attached to or installed in any real property without regard to whether it is so attached or installed.
is interpreted in code of federal regulations part,which provides in pertinent part a the act applies to written warranties on tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,family,or household purposes.this definition includes property which is intended to be attached to or installed in any real property without regard to whether it is so attached or installed.this means that a product is a consumer product if the use of that type of product is not uncommon.the percentage of sales or the use to which a product is put by any individual buyer is not determinative.for example,products such as automobiles and typewriters which are used for both personal and commercial purposes come within the definition of consumer product.where it is unclear whether a particular product is covered under the definition of consumer product,any ambiguity will be resolved in favor of coverage.c the definition of consumer product limits the applicability of the act to personal property,including any such property intended to be attached to or installed in any real property without regard to whether it is so attached or installed.this provision brings under the act separate items of equipment attached to real property,such as air conditioners,furnaces,and water heaters.d the coverage of separate items of equipment attached to real property includes,but is not limited to,appliances and other thermal,mechanical,and electrical equipment.it does not extend to the wiring,plumbing,ducts,and other items which are integral component parts of the structure.state law would classify many such products as fixtures to,and therefore a part of,realty.the statutory definition is designed to bring such products under the act regardless of whether they may be considered fixtures under state law.e the coverage of building materials which are not separate items of equipment is based on the nature of the purchase transaction.an analysis of the transaction will determine whether the goods are real or personal property.the numerous products which go into the construction of a consumer dwelling are all consumer products when sold over the counter,as by hardware and building supply retailers.this is also true where a consumer contracts for the purchase of such materials in connection with the improvement,repair,or modification of a home for example,paneling,dropped ceilings,siding,roofing,storm windows,remodeling.however,where such products are at the time of sale integrated into the structure of a dwelling they are not consumer products as they can not be practically distinguished from realty.thus,for example,the beams,wallboard,wiring,plumbing,windows,roofing,and other structural components of a dwelling are not consumer products when they are sold as part of real estate covered by a written warranty.f in the case where a consumer contracts with a builder to construct a home,a substantial addition to a home,or other realty such as a garage or an swimming pool the building materials to be used are not consumer products.although the materials are separately identifiable at the time the contract is made,it is the intention of the parties to contract for the construction of realty which will integrate the component materials.of course,as noted above,any separate items of equipment to be attached to such realty are consumer products under the act.italics added.
elk contends that atkinson did not purchase the shingles over the counter or specifically contract for the purchase of the shingles in connection with the improvement or repair of the roof.instead,he contracted to have his house completely.elk argues that this distinction is dispositive because pacific purchased the shingles from the supplier,and installed the shingles on the roof along with the other roofing materials in completing the contract.thus,pacific provided an integrated roofing system.according to elk,this means that atkinson did not purchase the shingles or any other consumer product when he contracted for the new roof.therefore pursuant to code of federal regulations part,subdivisions e and f,the roofing shingles are not consumer products under.
in muchisky frederic roofing muchisky,division of the missouri court of appeals,eastern district,was faced with the question of whether of a home is a consumer product as defined by the act so that an action based upon a written contract for of a home may lie as a matter of law where the written contract contains a warranty on workmanship and materials.id.at 
in muchisky,the homeowner brought an action under a contract against a roofing company for breach of contract,breach of warranty and violation of the warranty act.muchisky,supra,at.the suit involved a contract to muchisky home with one layer of intec,modified bitumen,single ply system.a jury entered a verdict for the homeowner and the contractor appealed.specifically,the contractor argued that the court below erred in refusing to direct a verdict at the close of all the evidence as to the count asserted under because the contract sued upon was a services contract,not a sales contract,and being a services contract,the provisions of did not apply.ibid.
the muchisky court conducted an in depth analysis of code of federal regulations part e and f and concluded that it was apparent from the ftc regulations that products intended to be attached to or installed in any real property are consumer products subject to the act.section e attempts to specify what products which become a part of the realty are consumer products and which are not.if the consumer contracts for the purchase of such materials in connection with the improvement,repair or modification of a home including roofing then the materials are consumer products subject to the act.however,if at the time of sale the products are integrated into the structure of the dwelling,they are not consumer products as they can not be practically distinguished from realty.the succeeding subsection provides that where the consumer contracts with a builder to construct a home or a substantial addition to a home or similar types of structures,it is deemed to be the intention of the parties to contract for the construction of the realty which will integrate the component materials removing them from coverage under the act.muchisky,supra,at.
ultimately,the muchisky court concluded that roofing was a consumer product under.muchisky,supra,at.
elk asserts that muchisky has no precedential value here.furthermore,elk argues that muchisky was wrongly decided because it renders code of federal regulations part f pointless.we disagree.
as we explained in atkinson elk,supra,th at page,footnote,d,under certain circumstances roof shingles are consumer products under.accordingly,we must decide if this case presents one of those circumstances.
as noted,is interpreted in code of federal regulations,part.a close examination of this section reveals that some items that normally or usually become a part of realty when incorporated into a structure are still considered consumer products when their incorporation is part of an improvement,modification or repair of a home.e,the numerous products which go into the construction of a consumer dwelling are all consumer products when sold over the counter,as by hardware and building supply retailers.this is also true where a consumer contracts for the purchase of such materials in connection with the improvement,repair,or modification of a home for example,paneling,dropped ceilings,siding,roofing,storm windows,remodeling.
the house report on reinforces this interpretation.under concepts of property law,fixtures such as hot water heaters and air conditioners when incorporated in a dwelling become part of the real property.it is intended that the provisions continue to apply to such products regardless of how they are classified,cong d,reprinted in cong.admin news.
with respect to products that are incorporated into realty,we find that the crucial distinction is the time of sale.if the products are purchased in order to add them to an existing dwelling,then the products are consumer products.if,on the other hand,the products are purchased as part of a larger real estate sales contract,or contract for a substantial addition to a home,they are not.e and f,italics added.
as the muchisky court explained,it appears that as to products which are becoming a part of realty the distinction drawn is whether the product is being added to an already existing structure or whether it is being utilized to create the structure.muchisky,supra,at.
here pacific purchased the roof shingles at atkinson behest,in order that pacific would add them to atkinson existing home.although the intent was to incorporate the shingles into the realty,they were not purchased as part of real estate covered by a written warranty.
consequently,we conclude that under the facts of this case,roofing shingles are consumer products under.accordingly,we reverse the trial court summary adjudication on this point.
in his second assignment of error,atkinson contends that his breach of the implied warranty of merchantability under is not barred by the statute of limitations.
as noted,in granting summary adjudication of atkinson second cause of action under for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability,the trial court reasoned that it was barred because the breach occurred after the expiration of the one year implied warranty period governed by civil code section.
elk argues that atkinson cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability is barred because the alleged breach occurred approximately five and one half years after the expiration of the warranty period 
atkinson counters that is clear that civil code section is not applicable in this case.states the duration of the implied warranty is the length of the express warranty,and that any contrary provision is void.thus,limitation can not limit the implied warranty under as a matter of law.
atkinson has misread the statute.title of united states code section provides that n o supplier may disclaim or modify except as provided in subsection b of this section any implied warranty to a consumer with respect to such consumer product if such supplier makes any written warranty to the consumer with respect to such consumer product,or at the time of sale,or within days thereafter,such supplier enters into a service contract with the consumer which applies to such consumer product.a.subsection a does not speak to the duration of the implied warranty of merchantability.however,subsection b of section does speak to the duration of an implied warranty where a written warranty is given.for purposes of this chapter other than section a of this title,implied warranties may be limited in duration to the duration of a written warranty of reasonable duration,if such limitation is conscionable and is set forth in clear and unmistakable language and prominently displayed on the face of the warranty.b,italics added.
contrary to atkinson assertions title united states code section b does not mandate that the length of the implied warranty is the length of the express warranty.ordinarily may is a permissive not a mandatory term.bennett panama canal.it is true that in statutes the word may is sometimes construed as shall.but that is where the context,or the,compels such construction.citatio
