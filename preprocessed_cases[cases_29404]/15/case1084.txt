under california unfair competition law ucl bus,et a private plaintiff who has itself suffered no injury may file an action for restitution injunctive relief against a person or business entity alleged to be engaged in any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.as our courts have liberally construed the ucl,virtually the only limitation on such actions is that the plaintiff must be acting on behalf of itself,its members or the general public.in this proceeding,we hold that the purported victims in this case,all large fortune corporations that have individually negotiated written contracts with the defendant,are not the general public for purposes of the ucl.
facts and procedural history 
plaintiff,jose serrano,filed this action on august.purporting to act on his own behalf and for the interests of the general public under the unfair competition law,serrano alleges that rosenbluth,a travel agency serving large corporate clients,uses fraudulent accounting methods in order to understate significantly the amount of rebates,or overrides,that are due to its customers.as a result,rosenbluth is wrongfully taking from its customers millions of dollars that rightfully belong to them.
on february,rosenbluth filed a motion for summary judgment,alleging,among other grounds,that serrano lacked standing as a competent plaintiff to bring the action on behalf of the parties alleged to be injured,because he was not a party to any contract with rosenbluth.see kraus trinity management services,cal th,d.in support of the motion,rosenbluth submitted a declaration from michael boult,its vice president of supplier and customer relations boult stated that rosenbluth large corporate customers have substantial leverage in negotiating their travel contracts,and only rosenbluth largest corporate customers have the negotiating power to procure contracts with override sharing provisions of the type at issue in this lawsuit.each contract is individually negotiated,usually over a period of months.the evidence before respondent court,including serrano responses to rosenbluth statement of undisputed facts,established that serrano was not a rosenbluth customer,was not a party to any contract with rosenbluth,and personally did not suffer any injury as the result of rosenbluth alleged actions.in fact,none of rosenbluth customers are parties to this action.
respondent court denied the motion after a hearing on april.in so doing,the court stated t he real issue here,as i see it,is one of equity,whether or not it would be inequitable here to find that the plaintiff can not bring this action.i have not really seen anything which demonstrates to me that kind of unfairness evident here.
having conducted the appropriate de novo review of respondent court order union bank superior court th,d,we conclude,as a matter of law,that serrano lacks standing as a competent plaintiff to bring this action because he has failed to demonstrate that he filed the action on behalf of the general public.
discussion 
the unfair competition law ucl,permits any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public to file an action for restitution injunctive relief against a person or business entity alleged to be engaged in any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice as interpreted by our supreme court,the ucl allows a private plaintiff who himself has suffered no injury to file a lawsuit under the ucl in order to obtain relief for others.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d.the representative plaintiff need only show that members of the general public are likely to be deceived.allegations of actual deception,reasonable reliance,and damage are unnecessary.committee on children television,general foods cal d,see also bank of the west superior court cal th,d.
class actions and representative ucl actions make it economically feasible to sue when individual claims are too small to justify the expense of litigation,and thereby encourage attorneys to undertake private enforcement actions.kraus trinity management services,supra,cal th at,d.where the ucl action is based on a contract,the representative plaintiff may seek to vindicate the rights of individual consumers who are parties to the contract.see prata superior court th,d creditor falsely advertised credit program as same as cash without advising consumers that the program required minimum monthly payments aicco,insurance of north america th,d suit against insurance company alleging improper transfer of policies and assignment of liabilities without consent of policyholders hernandez atlantic finance d.suit against used car dealership and finance company for violations of the rees levering automobile sales financing act.however,a ucl action based on a contract is not appropriate where the public in general is not harmed by the defendant alleged unlawful practices.see south bay chevrolet gmac th,d no showing members of the public were likely to be deceived by wholesale security agreement between lender and automotive dealers.
the prata court drew a fitting distinction between actions brought to assert the claims of individual consumers under section,which lend themselves well to representative ucl cases,and actions that involve sophisticated business finance issues,which do not.prata,supra,th at,d.where the subject of the action is an unlawful business practice or false advertising that harms individual consumers,the,powerless individually,may welcome the opportunity to have their rights vindicated in a representative action under the ucl.this is not such a case,however.the alleged victims here are not unwary targets of false advertising committee on children television,supra,innocent youths corrupted by lawbreaking retailers stop youth addiction,supra,aggrieved used car purchasers hernandez,supra or a singularly dense group of consumers who fall prey to misleading advertising designed to lure them into loan contracts.see beneficial corporation federal trade commission cir.to the contrary,rosenbluth undisputed evidence establishes that its only customers are sophisticated corporations,most in the fortune,each of which negotiates contracts individually with rosenbluth and each of which presumably has the resources to seek damages or other relief from rosenbluth should it choose to do so.
indeed,serrano effort to act as the representative of these alleged victims not only raises significant logistical and constitutional issues,it may well leave the victims worse off than they would be if they filed individual actions against rosenbluth.the case of bronco wine frank logoluso farms d,amply illustrates the problem.in bronco wine,a grape grower who,unlike serrano,was actually damaged by the defendant acts,filed suit on behalf of itself and other grape growers who had contracts with the defendant winery.in its cause of action under the ucl,the plaintiff alleged the defendants had committed unlawful business practices that included wrongfully rejecting and refusing to accept grapes,adopting arbitrary quality standards,applying quality standards unreasonably in order to pay less for accepted grapes than the price agreed to by bronco,threatening to sue and suing growers who complained of bronco conduct.id.at.the plaintiff did not seek to join the nonparty growers in the action,and t the only nonparty grower who appeared as a witness at trial testified he had no objection to the amount received from bronco for his grape crop.id.at.
