plaintiff filed this action to challenge the failure of defendants to place health warnings mandated by california proposition on products containing nicotine sold over the counter as aids to stop smoking.the trial court granted summary judgment to defendants,ruling that in this setting the requirements of proposition were impliedly preempted by the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca et.the court of appeal reversed we granted review.
we conclude notwithstanding language in the fdca exempting proposition from the preemptive effect of the federal act,when the warning mandated by california law directly conflicts with the one that the federal food and drug administration fda requires,the federal requirement prevails this is a case of direct conflict and the fda has authority to prohibit use of the proposition warning,even though that warning is literally truthful,if the fda concludes that it would have the effect of misleading consumers.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
factual and procedural background 
on november,the voters of this state enacted proposition as an initiative measure.proposition added section to the health and safety code no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual this provision does not apply,however,to a n exposure for which federal law governs warning in a manner that preempts state authority.health.
the regulations adopted to implement health and safety code section state that the required warning must clearly communicate that the chemical in question is known to the state to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm,tit,subd.a.the regulations also describe optional safe harbor warnings that are deemed to be clear and reasonable,subd.b.one of the safe harbor warnings reads warning this product contains a chemical known to the state of california to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm,subd.b b.the warning may be communicated through product labeling,signs,or public advertising,subd.b a c.
on april,the state of california listed nicotine as a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity,tit,subd.c.this listing was based on the then current determination by the fda that because of the dangerous consequences of fetal nicotine exposure,nicotine delivery products should be rated in category x not for use by pregnant women consequently,to conform to proposition,defendants products must carry a warning that this product contains nicotine,a chemical known to the state of california to cause reproductive harm,or words to that effect.
the fda,however,has never permitted defendants to use the proposition warning.the fda currently approved warning does not state that nicotine can cause reproductive harm.it requires the product label to state if you are pregnant or,only use this medicine on the advice of your health care provider.smoking can seriously harm your child.try to stop smoking without using any nicotine replacement medicine.this medicine is believed to be safer than smoking.however,the risks to your child from this medicine are not fully known.the difference between the two warnings is the focus of this case.
the fdca prohibits a drug manufacturer from marketing a new drug unless the fda has approved the drug as both safe and effective for its intended use.in addition to scientific and experimental data,a new drug application must include a proposed label.b f.if the fda determines that the labeling is false or misleading in any way,the drug is deemed misbranded,and the fda will reject the application for approval of the drug.a.once an application has been approved,any change in the labeling requires a supplement to the application and approval by the fda,either before or after the change.
the issue here is whether california proposition requirements are preempted by the fda regulation,or preserved by the savings clause,section d,of the food and drug administration modernization act of modernization act,stat.section a establishes the preemptive effective of federal regulation it states in part n o state or political subdivision of a state may establish or continue in effect any requirement that is different from or in addition to,or that is otherwise not identical with,a requirement under this chapter the modernization act,however,contained a savings clause designed specifically to preserve proposition.it provides this section shall not apply to a state requirement adopted by a state public initiative or referendum enacted prior to september.d.proposition is the only state enactment that falls within the savings clause.
defendants here manufacture,market,and distribute products,such as gum and patches,that are designed to help people quit smoking through nicotine replacement therapy nrt originally,the products were available only by prescription.in,defendants sought fda approval to sell them over the counter.defendants application presented a complex labeling issue because the products contain nicotine,a substance that if taken by a pregnant woman could cause harm to the fetus.on the other hand,the purpose of the products is to help individuals stop smoking,and smoking is even more dangerous to the fetus,because it may deliver more nicotine than the nrt products,and also exposes the smoker to carbon monoxide and other harmful chemicals.as the chairman of the fda nonprescription drugs advisory committee stated this is one of the few instances where we have a product that has come before this committee that i would like lots of people to use,that i think we are underusing so we want to make sure that we are not introducing barriers that would prevent people from using them,and what is worse,somebody continuing to smoke or not calling their physician and talking with him i think,at least as i am interpreting the sense of the committee is that let be real careful on something we want people to use more of that we do introduce barriers that would reduce their willingness to use the product.mins.fda nonprescription drugs advisory meeting.
partly in an effort to balance these competing concerns,the products underwent an unusually long approval process.as of,the labels for the original nicorette,nicoderm,and nicotrol prescription products carried a required warning nicotine in any form may cause harm to your unborn baby.this is the warning required for prescription drugs containing nicotine in.but when the fda approved sales in,the fda advised defendants that their products could carry the following pregnancy warning nicotine can increase your baby heart rate if you are pregnant or nursing a baby,seek the advice of a health professional before using this product.failure to label the products exactly as requested,the fda warned producers,may render the product mislabeled.
in january,defendant mcneil asked the fda for permission to change the label for its product nicotrol to add the proposition safe harbor warning this product contains nicotine,a chemical known to the state of california to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.the fda denied the request,telling mcneil it m ust use the labeling that was approved at the time of approval.
the california attorney general,however,determined in a letter issued july,that the increased heart rate warning did not comply with proposition,because it failed to warn that nicotine can harm the fetus,and suggested that nicotine only posed a narrow risk of an increased fetal heart rate when the true risks appear to be significantly broader and more serious.
in august,after the enactment of the modernization act,plaintiff paul dowhal,acting on behalf of the public,filed the complaint here.plaintiff alleged defendants violated health and safety code section because they placed products containing nicotine into the stream of commerce without the pregnancy warning required by proposition.plaintiff also alleged that by failing to provide an adequate warning,defendants committed an unfair business practice in violation of business and professions code section et.he asked for an injunction barring defendants from offering their products for sale in california without providing an adequate proposition warning.
in november,while this case was pending,the fda granted permission to novartis consumer health care,novartis to sell an nrt product called habitrol.novartis is not a party to this case.although habitrol is identical to some of defendants products in nicotine content,indication for use,and method of administration,the fda approved novartis warning to consumers nicotine,whether from smoking or medication,can harm your baby.
when defendant smithkline learned about the habitrol pregnancy warning,it asked the fda whether it should change its warning.the fda responded that it was reviewing its position as it relates to the warnings of nicotine products concerning pregnancy and breast feeding.in may,defendants smithkline and mcneil each wrote to the fda,again pointing out that habitrol carried a different pregnancy warning than their products and that they faced litigation over the adequacy of their warning.in june,the fda responded to smithkline that while the fda was reviewing its position on the pregnancy warning,smithkline should continue to use the current warning.
on july,counsel for smithkline wrote to the fda seeking confirmation about the pregnancy warning that was required.the fda responded by letter days later,stating that the products must carry the pregnancy warning that had been specified when they were approved.
in march,the fda sent a letter to smithkline stating that even though habitrol carried a different warning,the instructions concerning defendants products remained unchanged the agency is currently reviewing its position regarding the warning on nicotine replacement products.as we have stated previously,until the agency review is complete,all sponsors of nicotine replacement products should continue to use the warning that was approved by the agency as part of their new drug approval.any additional or modified warning may render the product misbranded.italics added.
while defendants were working with the fda in an effort to clarify their obligation to warn,plaintiff moved for summary adjudication.defendants filed a for summary judgment,arguing that federal law preempted any obligation to warn under proposition.the trial court denied plaintiff motion,granted defendants motion,and entered judgment for defendants.plaintiff appealed.
while this appeal was pending,the fda responded to a citizen petition that plaintiff had filed with the agency on august.in a letter to plaintiff mailed august,hereafter sometimes referred to as the august letter the fda reviewed the medical literature,and said it would grant plaintiff request for a consistent pregnancy warning for all nrt drug products that clearly and reasonably communicates all of the known harm and conveys the relative reproductive harm of smoking,use of nrt drug products,and total abstinence from nicotine.the fda denied plaintiff request to require a warning on all nrt drug products similar to the can harm your baby warning on habitrol.that warning,the fda asserted,overstates what is actually known about nicotine and its effect on the unborn child.it also rejected a proposal to use a label similar to that required for prescription drugs on the ground that the warning to doctors was not easily translated into consumer friendly language.the fda agreed that the can increase your baby heart rate warning was insufficient,because it might lead consumers to believe that this was the only possible effect of nicotine.it proposed,instead,that all nicotine replacement products,including the products at issue and habitrol,bear the uniform pregnancy warning quoted earlier in this opinion.ante,d at,at.this warning advised pregnant women to consult their health care provider,recommended that they try to stop smoking without using an nrt product,and told them that the medical risks to their child from the product were not fully known.
the court of appeal majority here reversed the judgment of the trial court.it concluded that the savings clause in the modernization act precluded federal preemption of proposition warnings,even if there was a direct conflict between those warnings and fda requirements.the concurring opinion found no conflict between proposition and the fda requirements on three grounds a truthful proposition label would not conflict with the policy of the fdca the informal letters from the fda to defendants were insufficient to create a preemptive federal policy and proposition warnings need not be placed on the package,but could be posted elsewhere where consumers could see them.
we granted defendants petition for review.
ii.does the modernization act preclude conflict preemption 
the supremacy clause of article vi of the united states constitution grants congress the power to preempt state law.state law that conflicts with a federal statute is without effect.cipollone liggett group,d cipollone,quoting maryland louisiana,d.it is equally well established that c onsideration of issues arising under the supremacy clause start s with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superseded by federal act unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.cipollone,at.thus,t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone of analysis.ibid.
the united states supreme court has explained that federal preemption arises in three circumstances first,congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citation.fundamentally is a question of congressional intent,citation and when congress has made its intent known through explicit statutory language,the courts task is an easy one.second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.such an intent may be inferred from a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,or where an act of congress touch es a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.citation.although this court has not hesitated to draw an inference of field where it is supported by the federal statutory and regulatory schemes,it has emphasized where the field which congress is said to have includes areas that have been traditionally occupied by the states,congressional intent to supersede state laws must be clear and manifest.citations.finally,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.thus,the court has found where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,citation or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.english general electric,d,fn.omitted see crosby national foreign trade council,d olszewski scripps health cal th,d.
the first and second forms of preemption are inapplicable here.the savings clause in the modernization act demonstrates both that congress did not expressly preempt california law,and that it did not occupy the field of labeling of drugs.thus the issue here concerns the third form of preemption,referred to as conflict preemption.
congress has the power to preclude conflict preemption,allowing states to enforce laws even if those laws are in direct conflict with federal law or frustrate the purpose of federal law.geier american honda motor,d geier.the court of appeal here,relying on the language of the modernization act,concluded that congress had so exercised its power.
the modernization act,in united states code section a,prohibits states from enacting any requirement that is different from or in addition to,or that is not identical with,a requirement under this chapter.section d then provides that section does not apply to certain state initiative measures proposition comes within this exemption.from this language the court of appeal reasoned that california may establish requirements different from,and thus in conflict with,the fda requirements.
a proposition requirement,however,may be different from,in addition to,or not identical a to an fda requirement,without actually conflicting with the federal requirement.here,for example,if the fda had simply required the warning that n icotine can increase your baby heart rate,but had not prohibited other warnings,a proposition warning that nicotine is known to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm,tit,subd.a would not conflict with the federal requirement.the product label could simply contain both warnings.thus,contrary to the court of appeal view,recognizing conflict preemption would not nullify the savings clause of section.
the united states supreme court decision in geier,supra,established a strong presumption that congress does not ordinarily intend to bar conflict preemption.the issue in that case was whether the version of the federal motor vehicle safety standard promulgated by the department of transportation relating to airbags preempted a state common law tort action alleging that the defendant manufacturer should have equipped its car with airbags.the federal standard provided for a variety of passive restraints and a gradual of airbags.it was based in part on the transportation department fear of a consumer backlash if it were to require airbags on all cars at that time.
the controlling statute in geier,supra,like the statute in the case here,prohibited states from establishing standards not identical to federal standards.former d.it further provided,however,that compliance with a federal safety standard does not exempt any person from any liability under common law.former k.the united states supreme court held that this savings clause removed tort actions from the scope of the express preemption clause,but did not foreclose conflict preemption.geier,supra,at.
the high court went on to say nothing in the language of the savings clause suggests an intent to save actions that conflict with federal regulations.the words compliance and does not exempt citation sound as if they simply bar a special kind of defense,namely,a defense that compliance with a federal standard automatically exempts a defendant from state law whether the federal government meant that standard to be an absolute requirement or only a minimum one.citation.it is difficult to understand why congress would have insisted on a compliance precondition to the provision applicability had it wished the act to save all tort actions,regardless of their potential threat to the objectives of federal safety standards promulgated under that act.geier,supra,at.
geier also gave some weight to the department of transportation conclusion that allowing tort suits against manufacturers who had complied with the department airbag rules would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of federal objectives.geier,supra,at.it explained its deference to the department conclusion congress has delegated to dot authority to implement the statute the subject matter is technical and the relevant history and background are complex and extensive.the agency is likely to have a thorough understanding of its own regulation and its objectives and is uniquely qualified to comprehend the likely impact of state requirements.ibid.
geier concluded that the savings clause in that case preserved state tort law only when the federal regulation was intended to provide a minimum standard,not when it was intended to establish an absolute standard.plaintiff here seeks to confine geier by pointing to differences between the savings clause at issue in geier and the savings clause in the modernization act.he notes also the difference between preempting a common law tort action,as was involved in geier,and preempting a state regulation.but later cases confirm that geier is not a narrow holding limited to automobile safety standards instead it established a general rule upholding conflict preemption even if the applicable federal law contains a savings clause.see sprietsma mercury marine,d buckman plaintiffs legal comm,d.the united states supreme court has never interpreted a savings clause so broadly as to permit a state enactment to conflict with a federal regulation scheme 
the language of the modernization act savings clause does not express an intention to preclude all conflict preemption.the legislative history suggests an intent to preclude conflict preemption in pursuit of national uniform labeling in light of that language,history,and the principles established by geier,supra.and other united states supreme court decisions,we conclude that the savings clause of united states code section d,does not entirely exclude conflict preemption.
we do not,however,go as far as the united states attorney general urges in his amicus curiae brief and hold that the savings clause,by nullifying the preemptive effect of united states code section a,left the law of implied preemption,so far as proposition is concerned,as if neither were enacted.such an interpretation would allow the fda to pursue a goal of national uniformity in warnings,and to further that goal by preempting all proposition warnings.section a and d,however,establishes that a proposition warning can not be preempted solely because it is not identical with the federal requirement.if the fda directive here prohibiting nonidentical labels is to be sustained,it must be on a basis relevant to consumer health,and not because the proposition label would frustrate the fda policy favoring national uniformity.
iii.is there a direct conflict between the warning required by proposition and the orders of the fda 
the language required by the fda august,letter is not necessarily inconsistent with a proposition warning to consumers that defendants products contain nicotine,a chemical known to cause reproductive harm.the apparent conflict arises from the fda insistence that defendants must use the warning it has promulgated unless they have data to support a different warning.the fda has rejected plaintiff claim that his data justify a different warning,and defendants do not claim to have any additional data.thus,if a defendant were to add a warning to its label advising that nicotine can cause fetal harm,it would violate the fda determination and would risk legal sanctions.
plaintiff contends,however,that the fda action is not sufficiently definite and authoritative to create a conflict with state law.before august,the fda had regularly sent letters instructing defendants not to add any additional warnings to the warning,and cautioning them that adding such additional warnings might render the product misbranded.some letters advised the recipient that the matter was still under consideration.but amicus curiae united states attorney general,on behalf of the fda,acknowledges before its disposition of dowhal citizen petition by the august,letter,fda had not issued definitive advice concerning whether use of dowhal proposed warning labeling would render defendants products misbranded under the fdca.the fda takes the position that its august letter was the first definitive ruling on the subject.
the fda august letter specifically rejected plaintiff proposed can harm your baby warning,letter.it did not expressly reject all possible proposition warnings.it announced,however,that the fda had developed a uniform warning that manufacturers will be requested to implement.id.at.rejecting all earlier warnings,including both the fetal heart rate warning used by defendants and the can harm your baby warning used on habitrol,the fda said that the label should instead tell the buyer to consult her health care provider for advice.manufacturers were requested to submit a supplement changing their warning to conform to the warning in the august letter.id.at.
plaintiff argues that the fda august letter did not establish a required federal warning,but merely requested defendants to submit supplements.but the term requested appears to be simply a matter of courtesy it is apparent from the tenor of the letter that it imposes a duty on defendants.a company can not use warnings the fda considers misleading simply because it chooses not to comply with an fda request to submit the forms required to change its warnings to the one adopted by the fda.
plaintiff and his amici curiae point to language in the fda august letter stating that a ny other warnings proposed by the sponsor must be supported by data,as showing that defendants are not required to use warnings identical to the fda warning.but this is standard language that appears,or is implied,in all fda labeling decisions.a company is always free to change its label,after notifying the fda,if it has new data showing the former warning was inappropriate.see.the possibility that new data may justify a change in the warning does not invalidate the approval of the existing warning that warning continues to be binding until the new data emerge and a change is requested.
plaintiff and his amici curiae point out that the fda august letter has not been published in the federal register.there is no requirement,however,that it be so published to be effective.congress was undoubtedly aware that one common means of fda regulation is to publish rulings through letters to the parties requesting the rulings.when congress granted preemptive effect to fda regulation as to all state regulation except proposition regulation,it probably had in mind regulation through fda advisory letters.
in geier,supra,the united states supreme court gave preemptive effect to a federal policy expressed in a less formal manner than the fda policy here.rejecting a contention that formal rulemaking should be required before an agency action has preemptive force,the high court found federal policy to be sufficiently definite as to create a conflict when that policy was set out only in comments of the department of transportation accompanying its revision of the airbag rules and in statements in the solicitor general brief submitted on the agency behalf.id.at.
plaintiff here contends that although the fda has rejected several proposed labels based on proposition,defendants can not prevail on their motion for summary judgment unless all possible proposition labels would conflict with the fda determination.see dental amalgam mfrs.distributors stratton cir,chemical specialties mfrs.ass n,allenby cir,people ex rel.lungren cotter th,d.the fda seeks to prohibit any warning not identical to its own,but the absence of identical language is not enough to justify preemption,since the savings clause specifically allows state regulations that are different from or otherwise not identical to fda requirements.a.in this case,however,any warning that conformed in substance to the fda warning would not comply with health and safety code section because it would not provide clear and reasonable warning to the consumer that the product contained a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity.thus,the fda determination has effectively barred all warnings on labels that comply with proposition.
finally,plaintiff and his amici curiae point out that proposition warnings need not appear on labels warnings can also be conveyed through notices or public advertising,tit.because the fda regulates only product labeling,they contend that a proposition warning conveyed through other means can not be preempted.
the fda ruling,however,reflects the concern that proposition warnings on product labels might lead pregnant women to believe that nrt products were as dangerous as smoking,or nearly so,and thus discourage the women from stopping smoking.warnings through posters or public advertising could have the same effect of frustrating the purpose of the federal policy.conflict preemption does not require a direct contradiction between state and federal law the state law is preempted if state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.english general electric,supra,at.
we conclude that the fda august,letter established a federal policy prohibiting defendants from giving consumers any warning other than the one approved by the fda in that letter,and that the use of a proposition warning would conflict with that policy.
iv.can the fda prohibit defendants from using a truthful warning 
plaintiff contends that his proposed warning advising pregnant women that defendants products contain nicotine which can harm your baby or words to that truthful.he argues that the enforcement authority of the fda is limited to prohibiting adulterated or misbranded products a,and that a truthful warning can not render a product misbranded.he points out that not only california,but also the united states surgeon general and the environmental protection agency epa list nicotine as a chemical harmful to the fetus.see reducing tobacco use,a report of the surgeon general at epa determination.defendants dispute the point,arguing that the evidence is insufficient to show that nicotine can harm the fetus.
the fda august,letter sets out its views on the effect of nicotine on the fetus.because of the fda scientific expertise and long administrative experience,these views are entitled to judicial deference.serono laboratories,shalala,see geier,supra,at.but a close reading of that letter shows that the fda is aware that nicotine may endanger the fetus.
the august letter states although some of the pharmacologic effects of nrt products on the mother and unborn child are known,the full range of compliance or risks to the unborn child are not fully known nrt drug products have not been tested in pregnant women extrapolating from the animal data on nicotine exposure and considering the smoking data in humans,the agency believes that chronic nicotine exposure may represent some risk in humans for lethality,but likely presents little risk for teratogenic or adverse development effects while smoking has clearly been associated with fetal harm,the contribution of nicotine has not been clearly delineated.there are numerous other constitutants of cigarette smoke that may be major contributing factors to the harm caused by smoking.there continue to be unanswered questions involving the clinical pharmacology and toxicology of nrt use during pregnancy in humans and additional research should be conducted to answer those questions,letter.
the fda august letter recognized that its approved warning to doctors for prescription products containing nicotine states it is presumed that the product can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women.letter at.but the fda explains this labeling was intended to provide doctors with information to help them make treatment recommendations to their patients.the complexity of the data regarding exposure to nicotine during pregnancy and the relative risks of smoking versus use of nrt products are not easily translated into consumer friendly language on an otc package.letter at.
the august letter rejected the proposal that defendants products use the can harm your baby warning approved for habitrol.it said that this warning overstates what is known about nicotine and its effect on the unborn child.the words can harm may suggest to consumers that harm will occur in most,if not all,pregnant women who use nrt products the harm your baby warning may lead some consumers simply to continue smoking after failed attempts at abstinence because they will be resigned to the belief that use of nrt drug products are just as harmful as smoking.letter at.
contrary to defendants contention,the fda august,letter and its summary of the evidence do not show that the fda considers the evidence insufficient to show that nicotine can harm the fetus.the letter notes both that the effect of nicotine on the fetus is not fully understood,and that it has not been shown that defendants products are harmful.but it does not dispute that the nicotine in defendants products is a potential hazard to the fetus,even though the risks to the unborn child are not fully known.letter at,italics added.the fda objection to labels warning that nicotine can harm the baby is not that they are false,but that consumers may give too much weight to the warnings and decide to continue smoking instead of using an nrt product to stop smoking.
but even though it is p
