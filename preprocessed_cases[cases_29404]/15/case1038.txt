introduction 
plaintiff richard lytwyn appeals an order enjoining prosecution of this action against fry electronics,and various individuals associated with fry collectively fry.the court granted the injunction preventing further prosecution of this case until the resolution of an appeal of a separate case involving fry and a corporation named apex wholesale,apex,entitled apex wholesale,fry electronics,super.san diego county,gic the apex case the court enjoined this action pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,which authorizes the granting of an injunction to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings.
both this case and the apex case include various claims against fry for unfair business practices,including claims seeking restitution for the general public pursuant to the unfair competition law ucl bus,et lytwyn testified as a witness for apex in the apex case regarding his purchase of a piece of computer equipment called a from fry in august.after having the equipment installed on his computer,lytwyn learned that the box in which the came had a sticker that indicated that the might have been returned by a previous purchaser or that it might be a refurbished item.the sticker had been obscured by another sheet of paper on the box.lytwyn also testified that the did not work properly and that fry had failed to adequately respond to his complaints regarding the incident.
in this case,lytwyn moved for summary adjudication of his claims that fry had violated business and professions code section and that such conduct violated business and professions code section.lytwyn motion for summary adjudication was based on evidence that had been presented in the apex case.the trial court concluded that this case should be enjoined pending resolution of the appeal in the apex case because lytwyn had become so identified with the matters litigated in the apex case that t his action,in so far as it seeks to recover on behalf of all others or the public would be a mere rehash of parts of the apex matter.
lytwyn claims the trial court erred in enjoining prosecution of this case pending the resolution of the appeal in the apex case because he is not in privity with apex.we agree and reverse the order.
while lytwyn appeal was pending,the voters of california passed,a measure that amended certain provisions of the ucl bus,et and the false advertising law bus,et.in view of passage,we requested that the parties submit supplemental briefs addressing whether or not applies to this case and,if so,what impact,if any,has on this case,and heard further argument on these issues.
we conclude that amendments of business and professions code sections,and see bus,as amended by,as approved by voters,do apply to this case,and require that we direct the trial court to grant judgment on the pleadings in favor of fry with respect to lytwyn representative claims on behalf of the general public.we also direct the trial court to grant lytwyn leave to amend his complaint to comply with the business and professions code as amended by.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the apex case 
in november,apex,a seller of computer equipment,filed a second amended complaint against fry.apex claimed fry had violated the unfair practices act bus,committed intentional and negligent interference with prospective advantage,published false advertising bus,and violated the ucl.apex sought damages on behalf of itself and the general public.
in june,the court held a bifurcated trial on four of apex claims prior to the commencement of the trial,the court ruled that evidence admitted in the first phase would also be admitted in the second phase,and that the parties would be allowed to present additional evidence during the second phase.the court then held a jury trial on apex legal claims,namely,its unfair practices act claim and its claim of intentional interference with prospective advantage.during the jury trial,lytwyn testified for apex regarding his experience in purchasing a from fry in august.the jury returned a verdict in favor of fry on all of apex legal claims.
between the first and second phases of the trial,apex moved to amend its complaint to conform to the proof presented during the first phase of the trial.apex proposed to amend its complaint to specifically allege that fry had violated business and professions code section by advertising used goods as new.apex acknowledged that its existing complaint alleged that fry advertised secondhand or refurbished goods as new,but noted that the complaint did not specifically allege a violation of business and professions code section.apex contended that the trial testimony of lytwyn and other witnesses demonstrated that fry had violated business and professions code section.fry opposed the motion to amend.the trial court denied the motion.
the second phase of the trial was a court trial on apex false advertising and ucl claims.in october,the court issued a statement of intended decision in which it denied apex relief on all of its claims.in september,the trial court issued a statement of decision and a judgment in favor of fry on all of apex claims,with the exception of one portion of apex complaint not relevant here.in its statement of decision,the trial court did not expressly address business and professions code section.
apex filed a motion for a new trial in which it argued that the court had failed to make findings as to fry alleged violation of business and professions code section.the trial court denied the motion for new trial.apex appeal is currently pending in this court.apex wholesale,fry electronics.
lytwyn complaint in this case 
in may,lytwyn filed a complaint alleging that fry had failed to honor its warranty obligations,sold used goods as new,advertised used goods as new,published misleading advertising,and engaged in unfair competition.in particular,lytwyn alleged that on august,fry had advertised various goods as being on sale when the goods were either not actually on sale,or were offered at a reduced price because they were not first quality goods.lytwyn claimed he purchased a in response to the august advertisement and that after purchasing the,he discovered that fry had failed to adequately disclose that the had been returned by a previous customer and that it did not work properly.lytwyn also alleged that fry had published an advertisement on november,for a particular type of computer scanner,but that consumers who responded to the advertisement were sold an inferior product.
lytwyn alleged that fry conduct violated the consumer warranty act,the consumer legal remedies act,et,and business and professions code sections,and.lytwyn sought numerous forms of relief including restitution to identifiable victims,including plaintiff,among the general public 
fry efforts to prevent this action from proceeding pending resolution of the apex case 
in may,fry filed a notice of related case and request for reassignment in this case.fry requested that this case be reassigned to the trial judge who presided over the apex case.lytwyn opposed the request.the case was not reassigned.in june,fry filed an ex parte application for an order staying this case and reassigning it to the trial judge who presided over the apex case.although the record does not contain the minute order,it is undisputed that the trial court denied the application.
shortly thereafter,fry moved to stay this action pending resolution of the apex case.in july,the trial court issued a tentative ruling granting the motion.the court held oral argument on the motion in early august.after oral argument,the court denied the motion without prejudice.
on august,fry filed a renewed motion to stay this case.on august,fry filed an ex parte application in the apex case requesting that the trial court in that case assume jurisdiction over this case.on september,the court in the apex case denied fry request.
on november,the trial court in this case issued a tentative ruling denying fry august motion for a stay.on november,the trial court held a hearing on the motion to stay and denied the motion.however,during the hearing,after fry counsel presented its arguments as to why the court should enjoin this action,the court said that although it did not believe a stay was appropriate at that time,it would deal with it on an basis.
in december,lytwyn filed a motion for summary adjudication of his claim that fry had violated business and professions code section and his claim that such conduct violated business and professions code section.in his motion,lytwyn claimed fry had violated business and professions code section by failing to disclose in its advertisements that some of the items it was offering for sale were customer returns or open box items,and by failing to sufficiently indicate the used nature of goods at the time of sale.lytwyn claimed such conduct violated business and professions code section,and requested that the court order fry to locate and to provide restitution to all person s sold returned merchandise,where fry did not publish a disclaimer within the advertising indicating that the merchandise was a customer return.
in support of his motion for summary adjudication,lytwyn relied on evidence from the apex case.he submitted trial transcripts of the testimony of a fry employee and a consumer witness from the apex case,as well as the transcript of the deposition of a former fry employee taken in the apex case.in addition,in support of his motion for summary adjudication in this case,lytwyn offered a declaration in which he related his experience in purchasing the.the declaration was virtually identical to his trial testimony in the apex case 
in february,fry filed a motion entitled,motion for preliminary injunction and stay to prohibit conflicting and vexatious litigation based on changed facts or alternatively,motion for reconsideration of november,order denying motion for preliminary.in its motion,fry argued that lytwyn motion for summary adjudication demonstrated that he was seeking to litigate the same issues that had already been litigated and decided in the apex case,using the same evidence.fry argued that although lytwyn was not a party in the apex case,he was virtually represented by apex and apex attorneys in the apex case with respect to the business and professions code s ection claim.fry supported its motion with various documents it lodged in this case that were taken from the apex case.
d.the trial court may,order 
on may,the trial court entered an order that provided in relevant part 
on april,the court granted defendant motion for reconsideration and took under submission the issue of whether an injunction should be granted and a stay issued for the case entitled lytwyn fry et pending the court of appeal ruling in the case entitled apex fry et.
defendant motion for preliminary and reconsideration was brought february,related to the court ruling on november,and is granted on the ground that the plaintiff should be enjoined from going forward in the lytwyn matter until such time as the issues on appeal in the apex matter are resolved,and more particularly,the issues to which i am referring are those relating to the causes of action alleged by lytwyn under the consumer legal remedies act and issues of unfair competition,unfair practices and business and professions code sec tion as it relates the acts sic just cited.
when lytwyn brought his motion for summary adjudication it was a surprise to discover that the declaration of lytwyn in support of the motion for summary judgment was almost identical to the declaration of lytwyn filed in the apex matter.moreover,all of the other evidence offered in support of the motion was testimony from the apex trial or deposition testimony.a review of that testimony lodged documents together with the testimony of lytwyn during the apex trial also lodged reveals that the exact same facts were placed before judge enright in the apex matter.lytwyn,now in control of the litigation has chosen not to expand the subject and scope of his former testimony and offer of evidence.
a review of judge enright statement of decision following the trial lodged with this court reflects that judge enright found all the lay witnesses credible.that means,judge enright believed lytwyn testimony elicited in the apex matter.nonetheless,he denied relief.this action,insofar as it seeks to recover on behalf of all others or the public would be a mere rehash of parts of the apex matter.
discussion was had early on in this case regarding lytwyn personal,individual claims which occurred in and which he alleged in the complaint at issue.on august,discussing the issue of an injunction,the court asked counsel for defendant if he was asserting that lytwyn should be prevented from bringing his own personal claims by reason of his having testified relating to those claims in apex.citation.
at that point plaintiff counsel,on behalf of lytwyn indicated that the plan was to proceed on behalf of the public and not merely for lytwyn personal and unique damages.that being the case,i find plaintiff in the matter of lytwyn fry electronics,et.gic is so identified with the matters litigated in apex fry et gic that upon reconsideration i am granting the injunctive relief requested by defendants under civil code of procedure s ection,subdivision a.the action numbered gic is stayed,and counsel are enjoined from proceeding with or prosecuting that action,pending the outcome of the appeal in gic or until further order of this court.
discussiona.requests for judicial notice 
the parties have requested that this court take judicial notice of various documents in our resolution of this appeal.we deny fry may,request to take judicial notice of this court entire file in the appeal in the apex case.fry overly broad request fails to provide any specificity as to the relevance of these documents to the resolution of this appeal.see mangini reynolds tobacco cal th,d,matter to be judicially noticed must be relevant to a material issue mangini.
we grant lytwyn december,unopposed request to take judicial notice of specified documents from the apex case relating to fry efforts to enjoin stay prosecution of this case.
we grant lytwyn december,fry take judicial notice of documents related to a failed legislative attempt to amend the ucl.the materials are properly subject to judicial notice and may be relied on in interpreting the ucl,subd.c official acts stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d,consistently,just last term,the legislature rejected several pieces of proposed legislation designed to restrict ucl standing in various ways.
finally,we deny lytwyn august,request to take judicial notice of a contempt order and a decision regarding a nonsuit issued in the apex case,and the complaint filed in a separate action entitled bivens fry electronics,et super.san diego county,no.gic because these documents are not relevant to the issues in this appeal.mangini,supra,cal th at,d.
b.the trial court april,ruling granting fry motion for reconsideration and the court may,order granting a preliminary injunction are properly before this court 
lytwyn filed a notice of appeal challenging the trial court may,order granting fry motion for preliminary injunction and stay.in addition,in his brief in this court,lytwyn challenges the trial court april,ruling granting fry motion for reconsideration.we consider whether these rulings are reviewable under the circumstances of this case.
the may,order 
the may,order provided that the trial court was granting the injunctive relief requested by defendants under section subdivision a.the order also provided that t he action numbered gic is stayed,and counsel are enjoined from proceeding with or prosecuting that action 
an order granting a preliminary injunction is an appealable order.waremart foods united food and commercial workers union,local th,fn,d,subd.a.however,an order staying proceedings in the same action is not an appealable order.bailey fosca oil d.bailey,italics added.
in bailey,the respondent moved to dismiss an appeal on the ground that the appeal was taken from a nonappealable order staying a case.bailey,supra,d at.the order provided,it is ordered by the court that the motion for order staying prosecution and extending time to plead be,and it is hereby granted,and the plaintiff shall not apply for a default and the defendant shall not be required to file any pleading until ten days after the defendant motion for security under corporations code section is disposed of.bailey,supra,at.the bailey court noted that when the propriety of an appeal is not free from dubiety,the better practice is to deny the motion to dismiss and permit the appeal to be determined on the merits.id.at.the court broadly construed the restraint preventing the plaintiff from applying for a default as an appealable injunction,and denied the motion to dismiss.ibid.
in this case,fry motion was expressly styled as a motion for an injunction or,in the alternative,a motion to stay the case.further,the trial court expressly stated it was granting an injunction,and cited the statutory provision authorizing the issuance of injunctions.under these circumstances,we conclude that the trial court may,order is appealable as an injunction pursuant to section,subdivision a.
the april,ruling 
fry claims that the april,ruling is not within the scope of this appeal because lytwyn did not refer to that ruling in his notice of appeal.
the april,ruling granting reconsideration was not itself an appealable order.see.however,section provides,upon an appeal pursuant to section or,the reviewing court may review the verdict or decision and any intermediate ruling,proceeding,order or decision which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment or order appealed from or which substantially affects the rights of a party,including,on any appeal from the judgment,any order on motion for a new trial,and may affirm,reverse or modify any judgment or order appealed from and may direct the proper judgment or order to be entered,and may,if necessary or proper,direct a new trial or further proceedings to be had.italics added.
we concluded above that the trial court may,order is an appealable order pursuant to section,subdivision a.further,in its may order,the court stated,on april,the court granted defendant motion for reconsideration and took under submission the issue of whether an injunction should be granted thus,the april,ruling necessarily affects the may,order.pursuant to section,the april,nonappealable ruling granting reconsideration was reviewable in lytwyn appeal from the may,appealable order granting injunctive relief.further,a notice of appeal from an appealable order need not specify prior nonappealable rulings.gavin ymca of metropolitan los angeles th,d.therefore,lytwyn was not required to specify the april,ruling in his notice of appeal from the may,order.accordingly,we conclude the april,ruling is reviewable in this appeal.
c.the trial court did not err in issuing its april,ruling granting fry motion for reconsideration 
lytwyn claims the trial court improperly granted fry motion to reconsider its november,motion because the motion was untimely and because it was not based on new or different facts,circumstances,or law,subds.a,b.
fry brought its motion for reconsideration pursuant to section,subdivisions a and b 
a when an application for an order has been made to a judge,or to a court,and refused in whole or in part,or granted,or granted conditionally,or on terms,any party affected by the order may,within days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,make application to the same judge or court that made the order,to reconsider the matter and modify,amend,or revoke the prior order.the party making the application shall state by affidavit what application was made before,when and to what judge,what order or decisions were made,and what new or different facts,circumstances,or law are claimed to be shown.
b a party who originally made an application for an order which was refused in whole or part,or granted conditionally or on terms,may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what application was made before,when and to what judge,what order or decisions were made,and what new or different facts,circumstances,or law are claimed to be shown.for a failure to comply with this subdivision,any order made on a subsequent application may be revoked or set aside on ex parte motion.
section,subdivision b does not contain a time limitation.accordingly,fry motion for reconsideration was not untimely if it met the requirements set forth in section,subdivision b 
fry motion was premised on lytwyn motion for summary adjudication in this case,which was filed on december.fry previous motion for a preliminary injunction was denied on november.fry motion was clearly based on new or different facts since the basis for its motion for summary adjudication with its supporting not been filed at the time the motion for a preliminary injunction was brought and denied,subd.b.accordingly,we reject lytwyn claim that the trial court erred in granting fry motion to reconsider its november,order.
d.the trial court was not authorized to enjoin this action pursuant to the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction because lytwyn was not in privity with apex 
section,subdivision a provides that an injunction may be granted w here the restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings.lytwyn claims the trial court improperly enjoined this action pursuant to section,subdivision a because the apex case can not have any res judicata effect in this case.fry claims the trial court was empowered to enjoin this action pursuant to section,subdivision a,which is a subset of the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction.fry notes that t he established rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction provides that where two or more courts possess concurrent subject matter jurisdiction over a cause,the court that first asserts jurisdiction assumes it to the exclusion of all others,thus rendering concurrent jurisdiction exclusive with the first court.franklin franklin owners for fair franchising th,d.fry contends that because lytwyn interests are being vindicated in the apex case,pursuant to the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction,lytwyn may not bring a second action seeking to litigate those same interests in this case.
fry acknowledges that a trial court ability to stay an action on the basis of the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction is predicated upon the court finding of privity between the plaintiff in the action to be stayed and the plaintiff in the prior action fry contends that the trial court properly concluded lytwyn was in privity with apex.
we conclude lytwyn was not in privity with apex,and that the trial court was therefore not authorized to enjoin this action pursuant to the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction 
standard of review 
ordinarily,we review an order granting a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d.of course,questions underlying the preliminary injunction are reviewed under the appropriate standard of review.thus,for example,issues of fact are subject to review under the substantial evidence standard issues of pure law are subject to independent review.id.at,d.
as fry acknowledges,the trial court granting of a preliminary injunction in this case rested upon its implied conclusion that lytwyn was in privity with apex.specifically,the court concluded,plaintiff in this case is so identified with the matters litigated in apex fry,et gic that upon reconsideration i am granting the injunctive relief requested by the defendants under section,subdivision a.we review the court conclusion of privity de novo because the issue,which ultimately involves the requisites and limits of due process,is a legal one.victa merle norman cosmetics,th,d.
we reject fry argument that the question whether privity exists in this case is reviewable as an issue of fact.fry contends that the substantial evidence standard applies because the trial court conclusion regarding privity was premised upon its factual assessments regarding the credibility of plaintiff counsel and lytwyn protestations that privity did not exist,and of plaintiff counsel motivations in bringing this action in the name of lytwyn.with regard to the trial court purported credibility determinations,the trial court rejection of arguments regarding the applicability of privity in this case does not create a question of fact.with regard to plaintiffs counsel motivations,the trial court did not find that this litigation was a sham in which plaintiff counsel,rather than lytwyn,was in fact the person bringing this action.
further,even assuming the trial court had made factual determinations in reaching its conclusion that lytwyn was in privity with apex,the question of the applicability of privity in this context is ultimately a legal one,which we review de novo.victa merle norman cosmetics,supra,th at,d.the cases fry cites in favor of the proposition that privity determinations are reviewable for substantial evidence are distinguishable in that they concerned the concept of privity of contract zirker baber d,rogers whitson d,rather than privity in the context of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction,as in this case.
lytwyn was not in privity with apex 
a.the concept of privity 
the doctrine of res judicata rests upon the ground that the party to be affected,or some other with whom he is in privity,has litigated,or had an opportunity to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent jurisdiction,and should not be permitted to litigate it again to the harassment and vexation of his opponent.citizens for open access to sand and tide,seadrift ass th,d coast,italics added.
the concept of privity for the purposes of res judicata or collateral estoppel refers to a mutual or successive relationship to the same rights of property,or to such an identification in interest of one person with another as to represent the same legal rights citations and,more recently,to a relationship between the party to be estopped and the unsuccessful party in the prior litigation which is sufficiently close so as to justify application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.citations.citations.this requirement of identity of parties or privity is a requirement of due process of law.citation.due process requires that the nonparty have had an identity or community of interest with,and adequate representation by,the party in the first action.citations.the circumstances must also have been such that the nonparty should reasonably have expected to be bound by the prior adjudication citations.
our supreme court has recognized that privity is not susceptible of a neat definition,and determination of whether it exists is not a exercise.citations.citations.in the final analysis,the determination of privity depends upon the fairness of binding appellant with the result obtained in earlier proceedings in which it did not participate.citation.whether someone is in privity with the actual parties requires close examination of the circumstances of each case.citation.citation.coast,supra,th at,d.
lytwyn participation in the apex case is not a sufficient basis upon which to premise a finding of privity between lytwyn and apex 
in lynch glass d.lynch,the court of appeal considered whether a prior action decided in favor of the defendants precluded the plaintiffs from bringing an action seeking a public easement to a road.in the prior case,two corporations claimed a road was subject to a public easement.the judgment in the prior case determined that the public had no recorded interest in the road.lynch,supra,d at.although the plaintiffs in the lynch action were not parties to the prior case,one of the plaintiffs in the lynch action had appeared as a witness in the prior case.
the lynch court concluded that the plaintiffs were not bound by the prior litigation because the lynch plaintiffs were not in privity with the corporations in the prior case.the court reasoned 
appellants were apparently identified in interest with the two corporations in the prior case,with a view to developing their respective properties and establishing public access thereto.appellants side of the underlying dispute was urged by the corporations at trial and on appeal.citation.although appellants were fully aware of the prior litigation,the appearance of one of them as a witness gave them no power to control any aspect of the case.citations.moreover,appellants did not stand in a relationship with the two corporations which would put them on reasonable notice that they avoided the prior proceedings at their peril.citation.
it is true that the corporations asserted public rights to the roadway and that appellants stood to gain from any determination in the corporations favor.if the first lawsuit had involved the city of sausalito,which is in a position to safeguard the rights of the public,appellants might be precluded from asserting that a determination adverse to the city should not be binding upon them see rynsburger dairymen fertilizer,d.rynsburger.but collateral estoppel can not fairly be applied on that basis against appellants in this action.appellants are entitled to present at trial their claim that the road is subject to a public easement.lynch,supra,d at.
lytwyn testified as a witness in the apex case regarding the same facts upon which he based his motion for summary adjudication in this case.however,fry presented no evidence that lytwyn controlled the apex case or that he had a relationship with apex sufficient to put him on notice that the apex case would serve as an adjudication of his individual or representative claims against fry.therefore,lytwyn mere appearance as a witness in the apex case was not sufficient to create privity between him and apex.lynch,supra,d at.
the fact that lytwyn was a witness in a representative ucl action brought by apex asserting rights on behalf of the general public does not change the result.under the ucl,prior to the passage of,a private plaintiff who has himself suffered no injury at all may sue to obtain relief for others.citations.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,supra,cal th at,d.in proving such a claim,plaintiffs were entitled to introduce evidence not only of practices which affect them individually,but also similar practices involving other members of the public who are not parties to the action.cisneros registry,th,d.
thus,prior to the passage of,apex was entitled to prosecute its representative ucl action by presenting evidence of injuries suffered by members of the general public,including lytwyn.however,fry has not cited,and we have not found,any cases that state that the first court to gain jurisdiction over a representative ucl claim has exclusive jurisdiction over all claims that members of the general public might bring regarding rights or interests at issue in the representative action.fry specifically acknowledges that t he trial court stay order in no way suggests that other members of the general public whose rights or interests were at issue in the apex case would be precluded from acting as plaintiffs in a new action based on those same rights and interests.thus,fry argument is,essentially,that lytwyn participation as a trial witness for the plaintiff in the apex case precludes him from bringing this action.for the reasons stated above,we reject this contention.
we also reject fry argument that rynsburger,supra,d.and coast,supra,th,d support the conclusion that lytwyn was in privity with apex.the courts conclusions regarding privity in those cases were based on the fact that a public entity had represented a private litigant interests in a former action.see lynch,supra,d at.distinguishing rynsburger on this basis.for example,in rynsburger the court stated,where statutory authority to sue has been given specifically to a public entity by statute,a judgment rendered therein is res judicata as to all members of the class represented.citation.therefore,citizens and residents,to the extent they are in privity with or represented by the city or state,are bound by judgments against the governmental body.rynsburger,supra,d at.similarly,in coast,the court noted,we are persuaded that appellant,along with the public as a whole,was adequately represented by the state agencies vested with authority to litigate the issue of public access to the bolinas sandspit.coast,supra,th at,d.this case,in contrast,involves no action taken by public authorities authorized to represent the general public.
in summary,lytwyn had no control over the apex case and could not reasonably have expected to be bound by the prior adjudication,merely because he was a witness in that case.coast,supra,th at,d.further,apex use of lytwyn testimony to prosecute its representative ucl action on behalf of the general public does not preclude lytwyn use of evidence from the apex case to prosecute his ucl action in this case.we conclude lytwyn was not in privity with apex 
e.the trial court was not authorized to enjoin this action to protect fry from vexatious litigation or to prevent the impairment of the judgment in the apex case 
fry argues that the trial court was authorized to enjoin this action to prevent plaintiff counsel strategy to relitigate the rulings that judge enright made in the apex case on their private attorney general claims against fry.we concluded in part iii d,ante,that lytwyn is not precluded by his participation in the apex case from bringing this action.the fact that lytwyn and plaintiffs in the other actions against fry have chosen to retain apex counsel to pursue their other claims does not render such suits vexatious 
fry also claims the court was authorized to enjoin this action in order to prevent possible impairment of its judgment in the apex case.fry contends that the apex case is a quasi in rem procedure because apex sought restitutionary relief.fry maintains that allowing this action to go forward presents the possibility of conflicting rulings regarding possession of the same identifiable property.fry acknowledges that this argument is contingent upon the plaintiff in the second matter having had a fair opportunity to have its claims regarding the property heard in the first action and that this concern is satisfied by a showing of privity.we concluded in part iii d,ante,that lytwyn is not in privity with apex.thus,even if the apex case were a quasi in rem proceeding akin to the real property cases on which fry bases this claim,fry claim would fail.
f.the trial court was not empowered to stay this action pursuant to its inherent authority to exercise control over its proceedings 
fry also contends that the trial court was empowered to stay this action pursuant to its inherent discretionary power to control its own proceedings.the only argument fry offers in support of this claim is that the collateral estoppel effect of the judgment in the apex case,if upheld on appeal,will render this a ction moot 
among the requirements for the application of collateral estoppel is that the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party to or in privity with a party in the previous proceeding.coscia mckenna cuneo cal th,fn,d.it is undisputed that lytwyn was not a party to the apex case and we have concluded in part iii d,ante,that lytwyn was not in privity with apex.therefore,the judgment in the apex case can not have collateral estoppel effect against lytwyn.accordingly,the trial court was not authorized to stay lytwyn action on this basis.
amendments to the business and professions code apply to this case and require that the trial court grant judgment on the pleadings in favor of fry and allow lytwyn to amend his complaint
