at issue in this case is whether the causation standard for a claimed failure to procure insurance under a negligence theory and under the texas deceptive trade practices act dtpa requires proof of the availability of some insurance that would have covered the plaintiff damages.in a memorandum opinion,the court of appeals held that such proof was not required and reversed the trial court judgment notwithstanding the verdict.we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.
the united states government awarded shihche lin,an electrical engineer,a contract to perform work on a hydroelectric plant in michigan.the contract required lin to provide a performance bond and to procure commercial general liability cgl insurance.lin purchased the bond from a surety company and obtained quotes for cgl insurance from two insurance allied insurance through its agent michael mcglothlin collectively,metro,and elbert insurance.lin testified that he obtained the elbert quote because he did not feel comfortable with the original quote from mcglothlin as it lacked detail.lin forwarded the elbert quote to mcglothlin as an example of the type of coverage he sought.metro claims that the elbert quote is indecipherable,but lin claims that the insurance quoted would have provided coverage for the breach of contract claims against him.
the elbert quote contained a section with a subhead conditions under which terms such as explosion,underground,and host liquor are listed.in addition,it lists contractual with an x marked next to it.lin testified,x meaning that this will be covered.after receiving the elbert quote,mcglothlin advised lin of the premium amount for the coverage,and lin began paying premiums to mcglothlin.however,it is undisputed that metro failed to write or procure a cgl policy for lin.
the federal government later terminated lin contract and required lin surety company to complete the contract under the performance bond.to recoup the money it spent to complete the contract,the surety company sued lin in november.lin appeared pro se,but later asked metro to provide him with an attorney.mcglothlin repeatedly assured him that a cgl policy was in place and that a lawyer would be provided to lin to assist in his defense under lin cgl policy.in,mcglothlin discovered that no policy existed and reported the situation to metro errors and omissions insurer.metro errors and omissions insurance company refused to defend lin,and metro did not provide a defense for lin in the suit filed by lin surety company.lin continued his pro se defense and eventually settled the lawsuit for,which was less than the surety company had paid to the federal government after it terminated lin contract.
lin subsequently sued metro for negligence and a violation of the dtpa for failure to procure a cgl policy,claiming that the surety company suit against him would have been covered by a cgl policy and that he would not have had to settle the surety company lawsuit if metro had procured an insurance policy as it contracted to do.at trial,lin did not present any evidence of the typical terms or coverage in a cgl policy issued by an insurance company utilized by metro,any evidence that a typical cgl policy would provide coverage for breach of an indemnity agreement under a performance bond,or any expert testimony opining on the scope of coverage for an indemnity claim under a surety bond in a typical cgl policy.rather,lin merely argued that he requested a cgl insurance policy that included contractual as one of its covered conditions.
metro acknowledges the failure to procure a cgl policy for lin and that this failure to procure the policy was negligent.however,metro disputes that the negligence caused lin any damages.in this suit,the jury awarded damages against metro mcglothlin of for negligence,actual damages of under the dtpa,and additional damages of for knowingly violating the dtpa.the trial court,however,granted metro motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and rendered a judgment in favor of both metro allied and mcglothlin,holding that lin failed to prove causation under either theory.the court of appeals reversed,holding that sufficient evidence supported the findings that metro allied,through its agent,mcglothlin,knowingly engaged in unconscionable conduct that was the producing cause of lin damages under the dtpa.the court of appeals further stated that for lin to recover,he is not required to prove a specific policy in order to show that he was adversely affected by the failure of the insurance agent to obtain the policy.citing parkins.farmers ins.
metro petitioned this court for review,arguing that both the negligence and dtpa theories require proof of some cgl policy that would have covered the damages,as necessary causation evidence,and that lin provided no such evidence.lin agrees that his negligence theory requires such proof,but argues that the dtpa theory does not.he further argues that,even if both theories require this proof of causation,he provided legally sufficient evidence to uphold the jury verdict.because the parties agree that the negligence theory requires proof that some insurance policy would have covered the losses in question,we begin with an analysis of whether the dtpa likewise requires such proof.
in,the legislature amended the provision in the dtpa to change the causation standard from adversely affected to the current producing cause standard.bus.com.code jacobs danny darby real estate,kilgarin,concurring discussing the amendment.absent other guidance from the legislature indicating the effective date of an amendment,the date the allegedly deceptive act or practice occurred determines which version of the dtpa applies.la sara grain first bank of mercedes.because the misrepresentations in this case occurred over a period of time in the late,the producing cause standard in the current version of the dtpa controls the resolution of this case.bus.com.code,et.that standard requires proof that the act was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury,without which the injury would not have occurred.doe boys clubs of greater dallas,defining producing cause under the dtpa prudential ins.of am.jefferson,same.we have previously endorsed this for the dtpa producing cause standard.in hurst sears,roebuck,the court held that because the misrepresentations in the case arose before the amendment,the controlling version of the dtpa required that the consumer prove he or she had been adversely affected by the defendant actions.however,the trial court mistakenly submitted a producing cause issue to the jury because the case went to trial after the amendments.id.we held that the mistake was not reversible error because the jury affirmative findings on the producing cause issues were sufficient to satisfy the statute requirement that hurst be adversely affected by sears conduct,thereby implicitly holding that the producing cause standard encompassed the lesser,adversely affected standard.id.at.
our previous opinions addressing the evidence required to prove causation in a failure to procure insurance case involved conduct that arose prior to the amendments and thus was governed by the adversely affected causation standard.see parkins,at hurst,at royal globe ins.bar consultants.in royal globe,we held that the injury to bar consultants was that it believed it was covered by a policy of insurance from any loss caused by vandalism when it was not so covered.id.at.we later said in parkins texas farmers insurance,that a plaintiff need not prove a specific policy in order to show that he was adversely affected by farmers conduct.parkins,at.in other words,under the adversely affected standard,plaintiffs only needed to prove that the insurer authorized agent represented there was insurance coverage when there was none,rather than that the terms of another specific policy would have covered the plaintiff damages.see id.
