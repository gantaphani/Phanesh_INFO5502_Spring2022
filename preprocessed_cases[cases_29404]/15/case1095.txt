plaintiff paul emery,brought the underlying action against defendants visa international service association and visa visa for unfair and unlawful business practices and deceptive advertising because foreign lotteries,in written solicitations to california residents,allow payment by visa bank cards.plaintiff,who never purchased a foreign lottery ticket and is not sure he ever received a solicitation,admits that visa played no role in the creation or mailing of the solicitations.nevertheless,plaintiff asserts that visa can be held vicariously liable,both criminally and civilly,for the over million merchants worldwide who accept visa payment cards.
the trial court granted visa motion for summary judgment,rejecting plaintiff theory that visa advertising,licensing of its logo,and utilization of its payment system creates either an actual or ostensible agency relationship with its merchants.the court also rejected plaintiff notion that visa somehow aided and abetted the unlawful solicitation of california residents to play foreign lotteries by failing to prevent the exploitation of its logo and failing to sufficiently repudiate the acts of merchants who accept visa bank cards.
this lawsuit is misconceived legally and factually.as a consumer protection action,it lacks a defendant who has engaged in any wrongful conduct and consumers who have been harmed.because plaintiff,a misguided private attorney general,has failed to identify any triable issues of fact and bases his lawsuit on mistaken legal concepts of expansive civil and criminal liability where none exists,we affirm.
although california sponsors its own lottery,the solicitation or sale of foreign lottery chances is unlawful.such solicitations were sent to at least seven residents of nevada county.these solicitations allow the gambler to pay by choosing one of several credit cards such as american express,mastercard,access,eurocard,visa,or diners.
the alleged victims 
of the seven witnesses who purportedly received the solicitations,only three bought lottery tickets margaret larue was years old and resided in a convalescent home.when john larue,her son and conservator,discovered his mother had purchased over worth of chances in foreign lotteries using her visa bank card,he complained to his mother bank and in charges were reversed.of course,john larue was incompetent to testify to his mother state of mind when she purchased the tickets and to what factors motivated her to play.janet berliner purchased lottery tickets a couple of times by check there is no evidence in the record that the presence of the visa mark on the solicitation influenced her in any way.victory daniels,who had participated in foreign lotteries or sweepstakes to times in the years preceding her deposition,had only recently obtained bank cards and barely used them for lotteries or sweepstakes.she testified at her deposition that the presence of the visa name as a payment option looked impressive and gave the solicitations the appearance of legitimacy.
the others did not purchase any lottery tickets.in fact,the lead plaintiff did not recall if he had ever received a solicitation.james huth had no recollection if any of the solicitations he received contained the visa mark,and he would have ignored it if they had.he owned no credit cards.anita wald tuttle tossed the five solicitations she received in the last years into the recycle bin.foyal sneed received solicitations from germany,but he,like the others,never bought a ticket and did not claim the visa mark had influenced him in any way.
the alleged wrongdoer 
plaintiff,in his role as private attorney general,filed the underlying action in february,naming only visa as a defendant.visa,however,did not issue a bank card to any of plaintiff witnesses.indeed,visa does not issue bank cards to consumers.nor does visa charge consumers fees for its services or contract with merchants to display the visa mark or to accept visa bank cards.simply put,visa has no contractual relationship with consumers or merchants.its relationship is with its members,autonomous financial institutions.
visa provides a medium for interchange and settlement among the financial institutions that lend to consumers and transfer funds to merchants.visa is an international organization of over autonomous financial institutions located in countries and territories.through its worldwide computer system,visa acts as a clearinghouse for credit,debit,and funds transfer transactions among its member financial institutions.it processes over transactions every second during its peak season and is capable of handling transactions denominated in currencies.at the time of the hearing on the motion for summary judgment,over million businesses worldwide accepted visa payments.
visa enters into contractual relationships with member financial institutions,authorizing them to use the visa payment system and the visa mark.acquiring member institutions then enter into separate contracts with merchants to display the visa mark and to accept,in lieu of cash,visa bank cards as a form of payment.issuing member institutions enter into contracts with consumers whereby consumers obtain their visa bank cards.visa does not set the interest rate or any of the terms and conditions of the consumer card.it does,however,publish operating regulations that govern each member institution participation in the visa payment system.those regulations do not permit the use of the visa mark or services in a manner prohibited by applicable law and specifically prohibit any merchant from indicating or implying that visa endorses any goods or services.
as a consequence,visa is not involved either in transferring funds to merchants or in billing cardholders.nor does visa receive any fee from either the cardholder or the merchant involved in a particular transaction.
the foreign lotteries 
plaintiff does not contend that visa either knew about or facilitated the solicitation mailings.in fact,plaintiff admitted visa was not involved in the preparation or distribution of the solicitations.the thrust of plaintiff action is that visa,once learning of the payment option provided in the solicitations,should have done more to stop the solicitations containing its mark.
visa submitted evidence to demonstrate ongoing cooperation with law enforcement in investigating illegal conduct involving the use of bank cards,including investigations of lottery businesses when they engage in unlawful activities.in reply,visa provides some poignant examples as follows i n october of,visa participated in an investigation in cooperation with,canadian and australian law enforcement into a business calling itself sl marketing.citations.after it was determined that this merchant was laundering sales drafts for an illegal canadian lottery business,pools international,visa worked with the merchant bank in australia to terminate sl marketing account,and eventually the merchant was shut down.citations.similarly,in march through may of,visa cooperated with the federal trade commission in investigating another merchant,atms or woofter,that was laundering drafts for canadian lottery telemarketers.citations.the information gathered by visa as part of this identifying the principals behind the passed on to the ftc,which filed for injunctive relief and eventually reached a settlement permanently prohibiting the merchant from providing credit card processing for any other business.citations.visa also assisted the customs service and several state attorneys general in and early in their investigation dubbed project rainbow of canadian telemarketers that were selling canadian and australian lottery tickets to cardholders,and then laundering the drafts through merchants.citations.working with law enforcement and visa canadian group member,visa canada association,visa secured information vital to the investigation and prosecution of the the names of companies and principals involved in the scheme,and the banks and consumers they had succeeded in closing the laundering merchants down.
plaintiff cited the same evidence but drew a different inference.plaintiff suggests that visa involvement indicates complicity,not cooperation.he argues that visa did not send any cease and desist letters to merchants until five months after the complaint in this case was filed.moreover,according to plaintiff,visa has not been proactive in protecting the use of its mark.
the communications expert 
plaintiff asked his communications expert to render his opinion as to whether the presence of the visa trade name or logo increases the likelihood that a reasonable reader of a lottery solicitation will participate in the lottery and whether the trade name or logo legitimizes the lottery.this expert opined that the visa card is seen as a ticket to the good life.therefore,according to classical conditioning theory and research,the trade name and logo are functional equivalents to the use of positive adjectives to favorably dispose the reader to buy a lottery ticket.use of a ticket to the good life legitimizes the lottery.
the expert also emphasized that the presence of the visa trade name or logo unconsciously encourages readers to participate.he provided the results of a sophisticated study.for example,researchers have exposed subjects to photographs of happy and or sad faces for extremely brief durations.these exposures are so short that subjects can not recall having seen the faces.nonetheless,ratings of initially neutral stimuli chinese ideographs made after subliminal exposure to happy faces are more positive,while ratings of initially neutral stimuli made after exposure to sad faces are negative.in other words,the presence of the ticket to the good life provokes a happy face and,in this case,a happy gambler.
the complaint 
the complaint alleges four causes of action.in the first cause of action for false misleading advertising bus,plaintiff alleges that visa authorizes merchant accounts that,in turn,allow the visa logo,trademark,and trade name to be used to solicit california consumers to purchase chances of entry in foreign lotteries.the use of the visa logo,trademark,and trade name falsely advertises the lotteries as legitimate and misleads the consumer to purchase chances based on the visa endorsement.
in the second cause of action,plaintiff asserts that visa conduct constitutes unfair business practices in violation of section.
in the third cause of action,plaintiff seeks to enjoin visa alleged unlawful conduct.he asserts that visa acts in allowing the use of their logos,tradenames,and trademarks in connection with such lotteries and in facilitating and profiting by the conduct of such lotteries constitute aiding,assisting,maintaining,endorsing,legitimizing,promoting and receiving a portion of the consideration from the maintenance of illegal lotteries within the state of california prohibited by california penal code sections through.
whereas the third cause of action asks the court to enjoin the unlawful conduct and to restore the money received by visa to those who purchased lottery tickets,the fourth cause of action seeks forfeiture of the moneys received by visa to the state.there is a prayer for attorney fees.
the ruling 
the trial court rejected plaintiff allegations of actual or ostensible agency as well as agency by ratification.the court also concluded there had been no unfair competition as a matter of law.the court explained there are approximately merchants authorized to use the visa payment system and logo.there are millions of transactions per day.as a matter of law,the fact that a few of those merchants are operating illegally does not impose liability on visa because those merchants use the visa logo in their mailings so that consumers may charge their purchases through the visa payment system.when comparing the use of the payment system and logo by a few unscrupulous merchants to enable consumers to charge illegal lottery purchases against the reasons,justifications and motives of visa,the utility of defendants conduct outweighs the gravity of harm to the alleged victims.as a matter of law,visa conduct is not unfair within the meaning of the unfair competition law.
moreover,the court held that although the scope of liability under the unfair competition statutes was broad,it was not so broad that liability is properly imposed on visa based on the facts that visa states consumers consistently choose visa over other credit cards,advertises itself as a trusted seal of approval to increase consumer confidence in visa merchants,urges merchants to utilize the visa system and to display the visa logo,and authorizes use of its logo by merchants.
finally,the court rejected plaintiff theory that visa had aided and abetted the foreign merchants by failing to stop the solicitations.the court held aiding and abetting requires proof of rendering aid with an intent or purpose of either committing,encouraging,or facilitating commission of the target offense.this requires knowingly aiding with guilty knowledge.the mere facts that visa licenses its logo and mark to member institutions and they in turn allow merchants to utilize the mark,even coupled with knowledge by visa that some of the merchants using the mark are conducting illegal activities,do not equate to aiding and assisting.judgment was entered for visa.
discussion 
plaintiff,presented with the factual obstacles that visa did not help prepare or know about the inclusion of its logo and payment option on the solicitations,asserts a circular agency theory whereby the merchants are visa agents and visa itself is the agent of the member institutions.his argument is fatally flawed on any number of grounds.
we need go no further than to remind plaintiff that his unfair practices claim under section can not be predicated on vicarious liability.the concept of vicarious liability has no application to actions brought under the unfair business practices act.people toomey d.toomey.a defendant liability must be based on his personal participation in the unlawful practices and unbridled control over the practices that are found to violate sections or.d at.unlike toomey,visa exercised no control over the preparation or distribution of the solicitations,nor did it have any relationship with the merchants who did.
plaintiff multiple theories of agency fare no better as a matter of fact or as a matter of law.we,of course,hunt only for triable issues of fact in order to determine whether the summary judgment was properly granted.union bank superior court th,d.as the trial court repeated many times,there are no disputed factual issues.when the essential facts are not in conflict and the evidence is susceptible to a single inference,the agency determination is a matter of law for the court.violette shoup th,d.
there is no actual agency.plaintiff presented no evidence of any agency agreement between visa and the lottery merchants,and while visa does contract with member financial institutions,plaintiff points to no provision establishing an agency relationship.
nor is there evidence that visa exercised a right to control the lottery merchants so as to create an agency by conduct.cislaw southland th,d cislaw.the evidence,in fact,was to the contrary.visa does not approve merchants,does not endorse their activities,does not authorize any particular merchant transactions,and has no say whatsoever in how the merchants operate their businesses.indeed,the unrefuted evidence shows that visa has no regular,direct dealings at all with any of the merchants.visa merely makes available a payment system to member financial institutions,which merchants can use,and adjusts credit transactions among those members.
plaintiff argues that visa delegates its authority over its trademark to its member institutions and relies on those institutions to monitor the legality of the merchants enterprises.again,the law is clear and dispositive.a trademark owner grant of permission to another to use the owner mark,combined with efforts to police such use,do not make the user the agent or intermediary of the owner.cislaw,supra,th at,d.the owner may retain sufficient control to protect and maintain its interest in the mark without establishing an agency relationship.
plaintiff insists that visa cloaks its merchants with ostensible aut
