ii.background 
reverse mortgages 
reverse mortgages have been described as a financial planning device for the elderly who are often house rich,but cash poor.see hammond,reverse mortgages a financial planning device for the elderly elder,hereafter hammond.a reverse mortgage can address this dilemma by providing a means for converting home equity into cash.ibid.in a reverse mortgage,as in a conventional mortgage,the mortgagee or lender advances money to the borrower or mortgagor.however,in a reverse mortgage the borrower is often times not obligated to repay any portion of the loan or the interest on the loan amount until the property is sold,the loan matures or the borrower dies or experiences an extended absence from the premises.id.at see also bb.the interest on the borrowed sums is added to the principal loan amount and the lender acquires a lien against the house in the amount of the initial principal and accumulated interest.hammond,supra,elder at.
b.the blacks reverse mortgage 
on march,the blacks entered into a reverse mortgage with freedom investment,a chartered lender,secured by a deed of trust on their home,then valued at.pursuant to this transaction,the blacks received and freedom investment received an interest equal to of the maturity value of the mortgaged property from the that the blacks borrowed,they paid as a loan origination fee and in other fees,taxes and expenses.
the loan amount of was calculated as the present value of representing of the value of the blacks home using a discount rate over a period of years the blacks joint life expectancy.in other words,brought forward with interest for each year of the blacks joint life expectancy should equal 
the amount ultimately due on the loan,however,would most likely exceed.if the home appreciated in value,freedom investment acquired an interest in a portion of that appreciation,thus increasing the amount ultimately due on the loan and simultaneously increasing the interest rate on the initial borrowed sum.
moreover,the interest rate was only if one of the blacks survived for the length of their joint life expectancy of years and continued to reside at their house.however,if they did not,the effective interest rate would exceed because the blacks liability was of the maturity value of their home regardless of the actual duration of the mortgage subject to a limited exception.
c.the annuity 
the blacks used of the loan proceeds to purchase an annuity from the union labor life insurance company union labor life,the terms of which provided for monthly payments of for life provided that the blacks made a second payment on the annuity four years later in the amount of.if the blacks failed to make the second payment,the monthly annuity benefit was reduced to.the blacks apparently did not make this second payment.
d.this litigation 
the parties 
the blacks filed this action against defendants the blacks contend,without citation to the record,that they dismissed their complaint as to five defendants and took the defaults of four defendants,including freedom investment.the defendants that allegedly remained thereafter,and which are the respondents herein,are ullico,ullico,mrco,mrco,union labor life,financial freedom senior funding corporation financial freedom senior funding,beverly mirtle,and james mahoney.the complaint alleges an intricate relationship between the corporate respondents and freedom investment and concludes that the individuality and separateness of these entities ceased and that they should not be permitted to adhere to the fiction of their separate existence.as to the individual respondents,the complaint alleges that mirtle was a sales person for freedom investment and mahoney the executive of financial freedom senior funding.
the allegations 
the blacks complaint includes causes of action for elder abuse welf,et,unlawful business practices bus,fraudulent concealment and negligent misrepresentation the complaint generally alleges that respondents used deceptive advertising and misleading transactional documents and that the reverse mortgage was written in a manner which was designed to disorient,confuse,and upset the average homeowner the complaint identifies the following representations as false and misleading assurances of uninterrupted monthly annuity income,guarantees of the highest monthly payments and the lowest fees and expenses of any home equity conversion plan being offered,and promises of no prepayment charge and the preservation for the blacks of of the home future value.the complaint also alleges that freedom investment used an unreasonably low projection of home appreciation for its illustrations and inaccurately described the tax characterization of the reverse mortgage transaction.
another component of the complaint is its allegation that freedom investment did not advise the blacks that they would effectively be prepaying interest inasmuch as freedom investment immediately acquired a interest in the home even though the amount disbursed to the blacks was a much smaller amount 
the motion for summary judgment 
respondents moved for summary judgment solely on the ground that the parity act,didmca,tila and their related regulations preempted the blacks causes of action the blacks opposed the motion and interjected numerous objections to the evidence on which the motion relied.the trial court granted the motion,concluding that federal law preempted the subject matter of the action.
iii.discussion 
general principles of preemption 
the supremacy clause of the united states constitution art.vi,cl grants congress the power to preempt state law.crosby national foreign trade council,d.whether federal law preempts state law is fundamentally a question whether congress has intended such a result.citations.the starting presumption is that congress has not so intended.citations.preemption of state law by federal law is found in three circumstances.citations.first,there is express preemption congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citations.second,there is field preemption s tate law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.citations.third,there is conflict preemption s tate law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.citations.such conflict must be of substance and not merely trivial or insubstantial.citation.it exists when it is impossible to comply with both state and federal requirements citations or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives underlying federal law citations.although state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law citation,it is preempted only to that extent and no further citation.peatros bank of america cal th,d.
federal regulations have no less effect than federal statutes.fidelity federal savings loan association de la cuesta,d.an agency may preempt state law through regulations that are within the scope of its statutory authority and that are not arbitrary.id.at.
regardless of whether the alleged preemption arises by statute or by regulation,courts are reluctant to infer preemption in ambiguous cases.see maryland louisiana,d elsworth beech aircraft cal d,elsworth tribe,american constitutional law ed.it is,therefore,the burden of the party claiming that congress intended to preempt state law to prove it elsworth,supra,cal d at.particularly in an area of law traditionally occupied by the states,such as the exercise of a state police powers,congress intent to preempt must be clear and manifest to preempt state law citations.spielholz superior court th,d spielholz.laws concerning consumer protection,including laws prohibiting false advertising and unfair business practices,are included within the states police power,and are thus subject to this heightened presumption against preemption.see california arc america,d unfair business practices smiley citibank cal th,d,consumer protection,affd,d spielholz,supra,th at,d.
alleged preemption under the parity act 
the parity act 
respondents contend that three statutes preempt the blacks claims.the parity act is one of those three statutes.
congress enacted the parity act in after finding that increasingly volatile and dynamic changes in interest rates had seriously impaired the ability of housing creditors to provide consumers with,credit secured by interests in real property a see also,stat.congress concluded that the availability of loans other than traditional,transactions was essential to an adequate supply of loans secured by residential property a and that federally chartered depository institutions had already been given permission to engage in such alternative mortgage financing a.
in light of these findings,congress enacted the parity act to eliminate the discriminatory impact that regulations authorizing federal institutions to engage in alternative mortgage financing have upon nonfederally chartered housing creditors and provide them with parity with federally chartered institutions by authorizing all housing creditors to make,purchase,and enforce alternative mortgage transactions so long as the transactions are in conformity with the regulations issued by the federal agencies.b.
the substance of the parity act is found in title united states code section,which provides in relevant part as follows in order to prevent discrimination against depository institutions,and other nonfederally chartered housing creditors,with respect to making alternative mortgage transactions,housing creditors may make alternative mortgage transactions,except that this section shall apply with respect to banks,only to transactions made in accordance with certain regulations issued by the comptroller of the currency with respect to credit unions,only to transactions made in accordance with other regulations issued by the national credit union administration board with respect to all other housing creditors only to transactions made in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the director of the office of thrift supervision for federally chartered savings and loan associations,to the extent that such regulations are authorized by rulemaking authority granted to the director of the office of thrift supervision with regard to federally chartered savings and loan associations under laws other than this section.a.on the subject of preemption,the parity act provides that a n alternative mortgage transaction may be made by a housing creditor in accordance with this section,notwithstanding any state constitution,law,or regulation.c.
a note to the statute that created the parity act directed the comptroller of the currency,the national credit union administration,and the predecessor to the office of thrift supervision ots,the federal home loan bank board see united states gaubert,fn,d,to identify,describe,and publish those portions or provisions of their respective regulations that are inappropriate for and thus inapplicable to,or that need to be conformed for the use of,the nonfederally chartered housing creditors to which their respective regulations apply,b,stat.the ots current response to the note instruction appears in code of federal regulations part part or section and is as follows pursuant to,housing creditors may make alternative mortgage transactions as defined by that section and further defined and described by applicable regulations identified in this section,notwithstanding any state constitution,law,or regulation.in accordance with section b of public law,note,concerning late charges,concerning treatment of prepayments and prepayment penalties,concerning loan adjustments,and concerning disclosures for variable rate transactions of this part are identified as appropriate and applicable to the exercise of this authority and all regulations not so identified are deemed inappropriate and inapplicable.
the arguments 
the blacks construe title united states code section c in conjunction with part and argue that the parity act only preempts claims concerning the areas identified in part,namely,late charges,prepayments,prepayment penalties,loan adjustments,and disclosures for variable rate transactions.respondents argue that part does not define the scope of preemption.they instead rely on title united states code section c and the purpose of the parity act to argue that chartered institutions should enjoy the same preemption of state claims that federally chartered institutions receive under the statute applicable to home owners loan act of,united states code et.hola.according to respondents,preemption under hola is broad enough to preclude the blacks claims had they been brought against federal institutions and that the parity act extended to housing creditors that same protection.
we begin by considering whether the parity act expressly preempts claims such as the ones presented in this case.the parity act permits an alternative mortgage transaction to be made by a housing creditor in accordance with section,notwithstanding any state constitution,law or regulation.c see also.transactions that are in accordance with section are those that are made in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the director of the ots for federally chartered savings and loan associations a.had that language been included expressly in the preemption provision rather than by inference only,the provision would have read an alternative mortgage transaction may be made by a housing creditor in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the director of the ots for federally chartered savings and loan associations,notwithstanding any state constitution,law or regulation.
this language is susceptible to at least two interpretations.on one hand,the phrase state constitution,law,or regulation is modified with the adjective any,supporting the argument that the preemption provision precludes all state regulation of alternative mortgage transactions involving housing creditors.
on the other hand,the phrase any state constitution,law,or regulation can be interpreted as implicitly limited to those that prohibit or impede alternative mortgage transactions or that conflict with federal regulations deemed applicable to chartered housing creditors,the regulations that the transaction must be made in accordance with.this interpretation would leave broad room for state regulation because there are only four federal regulations with which the transactions of housing creditors must comply.see.
other provisions of the parity act support the latter interpretation.the parity act requires housing creditors to be licensed under applicable state law and subject to the applicable regulatory requirements and enforcement mechanisms provided by state law.here,for example,certain housing creditors in california are required to be licensed under the california finance lenders law see,requiring license for finance lenders defining finance lenders as including persons engaged in the business of making consumer loans defining consumer loan as including certain loans secured by real property.that law establishes permissible charges and fees on loans,prohibits false,misleading or deceptive statements,and provides that unconscionable loans violate the statute.when congress enacted the parity act,it was surely aware that such forms of state regulation then existed or,at least,could come into existence in the future because it had no control over the changes and developments that states could subsequently make to their regulatory schemes.given the breadth accorded the states in regulating housing creditors in united states code section,the preemption language of section c can certainly be interpreted as not extending to state laws that concern aspects of those transactions other than those addressed by the four applicable federal regulations.
however,we need not conclude that this is the only reasonable interpretation of the parity act preemption language in order to reject express preemption in this case.as is always the case in our jurisprudence,where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation,we have worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.california div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham constr,d,quoting rice santa fe elevator.see also chicago tr.kalo brick tile,d of state law by federal statute or regulation is not favored in the absence of persuasive that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion,or that the congress has unmistakably so ordained,italics added elsworth,supra,cal d at,courts are reluctant to infer preemption,and it is the burden of the party claiming that congress intended to preempt state law to prove it.as our analysis has illustrated,the preemption language of the parity act does not contain a clear manifestation of congressional intent to preempt all state laws concerning the terms and marketing of alternative mortgage transactions.absent such clear manifestation,the parity act does not expressly preempt claims such as those brought by the blacks in this action.
the parity act and part do not impliedly preempt the blacks claims either.the regulations deemed applicable to chartered housing creditors are so limited in number as to be insufficient to occupy the field see.itel containers.huddleston,d concluding the federal regulatory scheme at issue in that case was not sufficiently pervasive to occupy the field.
the last form of preemption is conflict preemption.this form of preemption can exist through direct conflict,which respondents do not contend exists here,or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,which respondents contend will occur here.see spielholz,supra,th at,d.whether state law creates such an obstacle turns on congress purposes and objectives in enacting the parity act.
congress expressly stated that the purpose of the parity act was to eliminate the discriminatory impact that those regulations have upon nonfederally chartered housing creditors and to provide chartered housing creditors with parity with federally chartered institutions by authorizing all housing creditors to make,purchase,and enforce alternative mortgage transactions so long as the transactions are in conformity with the regulations issued by the federal agencies.b.respondents argue that this language indicates that the purpose of the parity act is the achievement of absolute parity with federally chartered lending institutions.thus,if those entities enjoy complete preemption of state regulation of their transactions,so should lending institutions.
we are not persuaded by respondents expansive view of congress purpose in enacting the parity act.of course,absolute parity would achieve the results that congress sought,but so would much less,such as simply authorizing chartered housing creditors to engage in alternative mortgage financing.the statute as a whole,in particular the permission retained by the states to regulate housing creditors see,counsels against respondents generous interpretation of congressional purpose,an interpretation that would permit chartered housing creditors to present information to borrowers in a misleading,distorted or even inaccurate fashion with impunity because of the lack of federal regulation.
for similar reasons,respondents contention that the goal of the parity act is national uniformity in the regulation of housing lenders with respect to alternative mortgage transactions is also flawed.given the dearth of applicable federal regulations,the national uniform standard for housing lenders would be anything goes.that is hardly a uniform standard.
moreover,different treatment of federally and chartered housing creditors is reasonable given that they are very differently situated.s avings associations are subject to a comprehensive regime of regular examination,supervision,and enforcement to determine their compliance with applicable laws and regulations,while n institution state housing creditors are not.
this distinction is significant.for example,in spitz goldome realty credit d,affirmed,the court considered whether hola preempted an illinois statute upon which the plaintiff relied in suing a subsidiary service corporation of a federal savings association,at.in that case t here was no question that the doctrine of preemption applie d with respect to the parent corporation citation nor did the parties dispute that there was exclusive federal regulation of federally chartered savings associations and that the bank board ha d the exclusive and plenary power to regulate all the aspects of the operations of federal associations.citation.at issue was whether the preemption that applie d to the parent federal savings associations was applicable to the state chartered subsidiary service corporation.id.at.
the court concluded that service corporations did not enjoy the same broad preemption of state law as their federally chartered parent organizations,reasoning as follows n either congress nor the bank board has attempted to set forth a comprehensive regulatory scheme for service corporations as they did for their federally chartered parent associations.recognizing the lack of such a comprehensive scheme,it is difficult to conceive that congress and the bank board would only regulate the home mortgage activities of service corporations in selected areas if they did not intend to subject these entities to additional state regulation.an intent to preempt without providing a comprehensive regulatory scheme could lead to the intolerable result of permitting service corporations to perform lending activities,which are traditionally highly regulated,unfettered by any regulation,at see also,at although service corporations are regulated by the bank board,they are not regulated to the same extent as federal associations.similarly,here,it would be odd indeed to provide to chartered housing creditors,entities that are subject to little federal regulation,the same relief from state regulation that hola affords federally chartered institutions.
we reject respondents interpretation of congressional purpose and conclude that congress sought to permit chartered housing creditors to engage in alternative mortgage financing so long as they complied with applicable federal regulations.permitting the blacks to pursue their claims does not stand as an obstacle to that purpose.the blacks complaint challenges the adequacy and completeness of disclosures and representations regarding the reverse mortgage.these claims do not seek to prohibit or impede the making of alternative mortgage transactions that comport with the applicable federal regulations they simply require adequate disclosures.nor do their claims tread on the areas of federal regulation applicable to chartered housing creditors,namely,late charges,prepayments and prepayment penalties,loan adjustments,and disclosures for variable rate transactions.see.conflict preemption simply does not apply in this instance.
our conclusion that the parity act does not expressly,impliedly or through conflict preempt the blacks claims is consistent with the ots interpretation of the preemptive scope of part.we defer to a federal agency construction of its own regulations and the statute it is charged to administer.see udall tallman,d.last year,the director of ots issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in which she explained that t he parity act authorizes housing creditors to make alternative mortgage loans as long as the transactions are in accordance with appropriate and applicable ots regulations.the act does not grant housing creditors the same powers as federal savings associations outside of the context of alternative mortgage transactions.even within that context,state law governs those aspects of a housing creditor operations not covered by regulations designated as applicable to alternative mortgage transactions under the parity act.the limited role the parity act plays in the overall regulation of housing creditors has not always been clearly understood,supra,at.
respondents contend that national home equity mortgage face cir face and shinn encore mortgage services,d shinn support their preemption argument.
the face decision does not provide us much assistance because the case concerned the preemption of a state law limiting prepayment fees see face,supra,at,a subject addressed in a federal regulation specifically identified in part as applicable to chartered housing creditors.that regulation permits prepayment fees so long as they are agreed to in the loan agreement.see face,supra,at.thus,conflict preemption was manifest.the state sought to avoid this result by arguing that the parity act does not preclude states from regulating areas that are not peculiar to alternative mortgage transactions,that is,that apply to common traditional,transactions as well as alternative mortgage transactions.face,supra,at.the court concluded that the regulation of prepayment penalties was within the regulation of alternative mortgage transactions and that the parity act therefore preempted the state law limiting prepayment fees.face,supra,at.
the face decision also opines,however,that part is not a provision that defines the scope of federal preemption.rather,it defines the gate through which the chartered housing creditors must pass in order to obtain the benefits of the parity act.if a state lender conforms to the regulations listed in the regulation implementing b,then it will enjoy the preemptive protection that the act grants in c.face,supra,at.however,because the state law at issue in that case limited prepayment fees,a subject expressly covered by an applicable federal regulation,the court did not need to consider,as we must,the scope of the preemptive protection that the act grants.
moreover,the framing of the question in the face case demonstrates that that court did not reach a result contrary to the one we adopt here.the fourth circuit explained the particular issue presented in this case is whether a chartered institution in virginia may require and enforce a prepayment fee in a mortgage agreement notwithstanding virginia limitation on prepayment penalties as contained in virginia code and.the resolution of this issue depends on whether the ots has issued regulations authorizing prepayment fees as part of its regulations for alternative mortgage transactions,because if it has authorized the collection of prepayment fees in alternative mortgage transactions,then virginia may not apply its law proscribing such prepayment fees if the chartered housing creditor has otherwise complied with the requirements of the parity act.face,supra,at.thus,the fourth circuit found it necessary to consider whether the virginia statute conflicted with a federal regulation pertaining to alternative mortgage transactions.here,we have no such conflict.
shinn,supra,is similarly uninstructive because it also considers whether the parity act preempts a state law prohibiting prepayment fees.shinn,supra,d at.the plaintiffs in shinn argued that the parity act only preempts state laws that completely prohibit or obstruct the creation of alternative mortgage transactions.shinn,supra,d at.the court concluded that the language of the statute did not support plaintiffs narrow interpretation of the statute preemptive effect and concluded that new jersey prepayment law was preempted by the parity act.id.at.
here,the blacks claims relate to matters that are not addressed by the federal regulations that part identifies as applying to chartered housing creditors.thus,face and shinn,cases considering preemption in that context,are inapposite and,for the reasons given above,we conclude that the parity act does not preempt the blacks claims.
alleged preemption under tila 
respondents also contend that the blacks claims are preempted by tila.we disagree.
clearly,there is no express preemption.rather than limiting the applicability of state law,tila emphasizes the continued role of state law,stating that it does not annul,alter,or affect the laws of any state relating to the disclosure of information in connection with credit transactions,except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.a see also b except to the extent that those state laws are inconsistent with any provisions of section of this title,and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.a federal regulation implementing tila explains,in relevant part,that a state law is inconsistent if it requires a creditor to make disclosures or take actions that contradict the requirements of the federal law and a state law is contradictory if it requires the use of the same term to represent a different amount or a different meaning than the federal law,or it if requires the use of a term different from that required in the federal law to describe the same item.a.
respondents argue that a state law like business and professions code section would impose subjective standards of unfairness,thus contradicting the requirements of federal law.even if the disclosures provided to the blacks met all of the requirements of tila and its implementing regulations,which are known as regulation z see part,an inconsistency or contradiction with federal law does not exist merely because the state requires disclosures in addition to those required by and under tila.a see also,supp.staff interp.a,generally,state law requirements that call for the disclosure of items of information not covered by the federal law,or that require more detailed disclosures,do not contradict the federal requirements.respondents vague assertions of a contradiction between state and federal law are insufficient to satisfy their burden of proving congress intent that tila preempt claims such as those brought by the blacks.see elsworth,supra,cal d at.
respondents also rely on code of federal regulations part a i which provides state law requirements are inconsistent with the requirements contained in sections correction of billing errors or regulation of credit reports of the act or and the implementing provisions of this regulation and are preempted if they provide rights,responsibilities,or procedures for consumers or creditors that are different from those required by the federal law.respondents latch onto the word different and argue that state laws that are merely different from federal laws are preempted by tila.but by its express terms,code of federal regulations part a i concerns correction of billing errors and regulation of credit reports,two aspects of lending that are not at issue here.respondents have not established that tila or its regulations expressly preempt the blacks claims.
implied preemption has no application here either.tila preempts only inconsistent state laws,thus implicitly negating occupation of the field.see mason general finance cir.
nor does conflict preemption apply in this instance.as we have explained,respondents have not identified any direct conflict.moreover,the purpose of tila,relevant to this action,is the assurance of a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit a.stated more generally,tila is desig
