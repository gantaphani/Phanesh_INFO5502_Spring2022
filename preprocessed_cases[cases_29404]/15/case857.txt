westlake moves to compel arbitration 
on november,westlake moved to compel arbitration of ramos and his coplaintiffs claims,relying on the arbitration provisions contained in the underlying sales contracts they each had signed.in support of the motion,westlake provided the declaration of john schwartz,the manager of dealer compliance and first payment collection for westlake,and one of its custodians of records.pertinent for our purposes is exhibit to schwartz declaration,which schwartz identified as a copy of the conditional sale contract and security agreement that alfredo ramos entered into when he purchased his ford expedition from pena motors in july.according to schwartz,ramos contract was later assigned to westlake.
the conditional sale contract and security agreement attached to schwartz declaration is in english english contract.it is signed by ramos and a representative from pena motors.page of the contract has a section heading highlighted in bold that states please read carefully notice of arbitration.this section of the contract contains the arbitration agreement that is the basis of defendant motion it purports to cover any claim or dispute in contract,tort,statute or otherwise between you and us or our employees that arises out of or relates to your credit application,this contract or any related transaction or relationship.the arbitration agreement ends by stating caution it is important that you read this arbitration agreement thoroughly before you sign this contract.by signing it,you are saying that you have read and understand this arbitration agreement,and have received a copy of it.if you do not understand something in this arbitration agreement,do not sign this contract instead ask your lawyer.you or we may reject this arbitration agreement by sending to the other a rejection notice by certified mail or by messenger service within days after signing this contract.
ramos opposition to the motion to compel arbitration 
in support of his opposition to the motion to compel,ramos submitted his own declaration,which had been prepared with the assistance of an interpreter.each english paragraph in ramos declaration is followed by a spanish translation of the text.
ramos declaration is the only evidence in the record of what happened in connection with his purchase of the used automobile,and we quote it verbatim,omitting only the paragraph numbers.on july,i purchased an automobile from pena motors in brentwood.upon arrival,i was greeted by one of the dealership employees,who spoke with me in my native language,spanish.negotiations for this transaction were conducted primarily in spanish.during the negotiations for the transaction and the signing of the paperwork,arbitration and alternative dispute resolution never came up.although the dealer provided me with a spanish translation of a conditional sale contract,the spanish copy of the contract was different than the english copy of the contract which i was told to sign.the spanish version of the sales contract does not have the arbitration clause.further,i do not recall ever receiving a spanish translation of the actual gap contract or of any forms pertaining to gap coverage.for the first time,i learned from my attorney that i had agreed to arbitrate all claims against defendant.i was surprised and had i known about these i would not have agreed to it.
ramos declaration was accompanied by two declarations from angelica mendez.one of mendez declarations states essentially that she is a certified interpreter who primarily translates for the superior court of santa clara county she assisted ramos in the preparation of his declaration she accurately translated from the english language to the spanish language,and from the spanish language to the english language,in the preparation of ramos declaration and she made a true interpretation of plaintiff testimony in this matter.
the other declaration from interpreter mendez,entitled declaration of interpreter angelica mendez re spanish language version of the sales contract,states in pertinent part as follows.i have reviewed the english version of the conditional sale contract and security agreement signed by alfredo ramos attached as exhibit.i also reviewed the spanish version of the conditional sale contract and security agreement signed by alfredo ramos attached as exhibit.the spanish copy of the conditional sale contract and security agreement is different from the english copy of the conditional sale contract and security agreement.the spanish version of conditional sale contract and security agreement does not have the arbitration clause.emphasis added.
it is undisputed that the english version of the conditional sale contract and security agreement referred to in the mendez declaration is the same as the english contract attached to the schwartz declaration.it is also undisputed that the spanish version of the contract offered by ramos ramos translation has no arbitration clause.the ramos translation contains ramos typewritten name and address,his signature on a number of pages,and terms of the car purchase for example,the price,vehicle identification number,and the like.
ramos argued in his opposition to the motion to compel arbitration that there was no agreement to arbitrate between him and westlake.the contract was negotiated primarily in spanish and an accurate translation that included the arbitration provision was never provided.ramos,citing rosenthal great western financial securities cal th rosenthal,argued that there was fraud in the execution of the arbitration agreement and thus mutual assent was lacking because the parties never discussed arbitration,and he had never seen the arbitration clause because it was hidden in the english version of the underlying sales contract.ramos also argued that westlake failure to provide an accurate spanish translation resulted in a violation of section and,as a result,the entire contract was unenforceable and void,including the arbitration clause and that the arbitration agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable and should not be enforced 
westlake reply brief 
in its reply brief,westlake attacked the ramos translation as inadmissible,because no foundation had been laid for it.westlake offered a supplemental declaration of john schwartz,who this time identified himself as one of the westlake employees who has custody,supervision,and control of the records and documents regarding the conditional sale contacts sic that westlake purchases from dealers.based on his review of westlake files and documents for ramos,he attached as exhibit what he represented was a true and correct copy of the spanish version of ramos conditional sale contract and security agreement that pena motors provided to westlake when westlake purchased ramos contract.we refer to this version as the westlake translation.
in many ways,the westlake translation is the same as the ramos translation.the same form publisher appears to have produced both spanish translations the terms of the underlying car sale and loan are typed on both forms and every substantive provision in the ramos translation is contained in the same place,verbatim,in the westlake translation.there is one key difference.unlike the ramos translation,the westlake translation has an arbitration agreement,in spanish,on the penultimate page of the document.the arbitration provision contained in the westlake translation is for the most part the same as the arbitration provision in the english contract,with the exception that the spanish arbitration provision names the american arbitration association and national arbitration forum as the arbitration provider,rather than national arbitration and mediation in the english contract.further,the westlake translation has no signatures.
in sum,while ramos offered a spanish translation of the underlying sales contract which made no reference to arbitration,westlake produced in reply a spanish translation of the underlying sales contract which included an arbitration agreement.this was the evidence presented to the trial court.
e.the trial court ruling on westlake motion to compel 
on january,the trial court issued an order granting westlake motion to compel arbitration as to coplaintiffs castillo and vasquez,but denying the motion to compel arbitration as to ramos.
as to castillo and vasquez,the trial court found that because both admitted that they received spanish translations of their sale contracts at the time of their transactions,they could not rely on section to avoid arbitration.the court also rejected castillo and vasquez unconscionability argument,finding that they had demonstrated only a minimal degree of procedural unconscionability and had failed to show that any substantive terms in the arbitration provision were overly 
as to ramos,however,the trial court found that while he had received a spanish translation of the english contract,the translation he received did not contain an arbitration agreement.the court recognized the differences between the ramos translation and the westlake translation,detailed above,and noted the variation in the overall number of pages between the two versions is explained by the entire absence of what appears in westlake version as pagina de,upon which the arbitration provision and only the arbitration provision appears.the court took this as an indication that this particular forms publisher offered versions of the retail installment sale contract at least those in spanish both with and without an arbitration provision.the court rejected westlake argument that the westlake translation was the only translation properly before the court the supplemental declaration of john schwartz attaches a true and correct copy of the spanish version of ramos retail installment contract that pena motors provided to westlake when westlake purchased ramos contract the issue here,however,is what ramos agreed to,not what westlake was given by the seller.as to the manner in which ramos placed the spanish language translation into evidence,while the exhibit was not attached to the ramos declaration,and the interpreter declaration does not attempt to authenticate it,ramos does clearly state in his declaration that the spanish version of the risc provided to him by the dealer does not have the arbitration clause.furthermore,the version presented by ramos includes his signature and initials in multiple locations,which the version presented by westlake does not.accordingly,the court accepts that the version presented by ramos is a true and correct copy of the one he was given,notwithstanding that he fails to actually use the words true and correct copy.
because the spanish translation ramos received did not include an arbitration provision,the trial court held that by operation of section,westlake has failed to establish the existence of an arbitration agreement enforceable against ramos.as an alternative holding,the court held that providing an english version of a contract with an arbitration clause together with a translated version of the contract without such a clause changes the unconscionability analysis so as to make the arbitration clause unenforceable on that alternative ground.
westlake motion for clarification and the subsequent hearing 
westlake filed a motion for clarification of the trial court order denying its motion to compel,inquiring whether the court section ruling meant the entire english contract was void or voidable,or only the arbitration agreement.westlake also sought to have the trial court explain why it found the arbitration agreement unconscionable.the trial court denied the motion for clarification,but at the hearing stated that its ruling permitted ramos to make an election to declare the entire english contract void as a result of the section violation or to stand on the contract,but with the unconscionable arbitration provision excised.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
trial court admission of the ramos translation 
westlake argues that the trial court erred in admitting the ramos translation over westlake foundation and authenticity objections,and that without a proper foundation the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the ramos translation was the spanish translation ramos received.we reject these contentions.
when an appellant fails to raise a point,or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned argument and citations to authority,we treat the point as waived.benach county of los angeles th,see also howard american national fire ins.th,conclusory assertions of error are ineffective in raising issues on appeal.that is the case with westlake evidentiary objections to the ramos translation.in its opening brief,westlake does not cite any evidence code sections or legal authority in support of these arguments.in reply,westlake makes a vague reference to keystones of the evidentiary rules that can not be ignored and cites evidence code sections,and in passing,without more.tellingly,these sections of the evidence code are not even listed in westlake table of authorities.cal.rules of court,rule a a appellate briefs must b egin with a table of contents and a table of authorities separately listing cases,constitutions,statutes,court rules,and other authorities cited.accordingly,westlake has waived its evidentiary objections to the ramos translation by failing to adequately address them on appeal.
were we to overlook westlake failure to adequately raise these arguments,we would reject them on the merits.under evidence code section,a uthentication of a writing is required before it may be received in evidence,subd.a.to authenticate a writing,the proponent of the writing must introduce evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the evidence claims it is.there is no strict requirement as to how a party authenticates a writing.see,nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the means by which a writing may be authenticated or proved.for example,a writing can be authenticated by circumstantial evidence and by its contents.people skiles cal th.a trial court finding that sufficient foundational facts have been presented to support admissibility is reviewed for abuse of discretion.people smith th.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the ramos translation.ramos declaration and the contents of the ramos translation together provide circumstantial evidence of its authenticity.the ramos translation contains the details of ramos automobile purchase and both ramos signature and the signature of a representative of pena motors on multiple pages.westlake does not dispute that the ramos translation is an accurate translation of the english contract,with the exception of the absence of the arbitration provision.the same form publisher appears to have created both the ramos translation and the westlake translation.in fact,the ramos translation is virtually identical in form,appearance,and language to the westlake translation that westlake admits it received from pena motors 
given the circumstantial evidence of authenticity,we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the ramos translation and finding,as a factual matter,that the ramos translation was the spanish translation ramos received at the time of the transaction.
whether an arbitration agreement exists 
on appeal,westlake argues the trial court erred by finding that westlake had not demonstrated the existence of an agreement to arbitrate.westlake contends that because there is no dispute that ramos signed the english contract containing the arbitration agreement,the only remedy available to ramos for a violation of section is to rescind the entire english contract,not to excise the arbitration provision.we conclude substantial evidence supports the trial court conclusion that westlake failed to prove the existence of an agreement to arbitrate.however,we reach this conclusion through application of contract formation principles and not section and therefore need not address westlake arguments regarding the proper remedy under that statute.

discussion 
it is undisputed that ramos signed the english contract and that this contract contains an arbitration agreement.ramos,however,argues that he was not aware that he was entering into an arbitration agreement because t he words arbitration or alternative dispute resolution never came up during plaintiff discussions with the dealership,and plaintiff never saw the arbitration clause because it was hidden in the english version of the risc.although there is no evidence to contradict these facts,typically these arguments would not be dispositive and a person would be bound by the arbitration agreement he or she had signed.no law requires that parties dealing at arm length have a duty to explain to each other the terms of a written contract.brookwood bank of america th.further,one who accepts or signs an instrument,which on its face is a contract,is deemed to assent to all its terms,and can not escape liability on the ground that he has not read it.if he can not read,he should have it read or explained to him.randas ymca of metropolitan los angeles th,randas,quoting witkin,summary of cal.law ed.
the circumstances of this case,however,are not typical.spanish,not english,is ramos primary language.when ramos went to pena motors,he was greeted in spanish and the negotiations for the purchase of the automobile were conducted primarily in spanish.pena motors then provided ramos with what purported to be a translation of the english language contract he was about to sign.in his declaration,which was prepared with the assistance of a spanish translator,ramos contended that he was not aware that the english contract he signed on july,contained an arbitration provision until he spoke with his attorney much later.all of these facts give rise to a reasonable inference that ramos has a limited ability to understand english.norcal mutual ins.newton th,w e must presume the court found every fact and drew every permissible inference necessary to support its judgment,and defer to its determination of the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence.the contract he ultimately signed,however,was in english.
under the general contract principles just discussed,the fact that ramos signed a contract in a language he may not have completely understood would not bar enforcement of the arbitration agreement.if ramos did not speak or understand english sufficiently to comprehend the english contract,he should have had it read or explained to him.see randas,supra,th at see also williston on contracts ed.o ne who is ignorant of the language in which a document is written,or who is illiterate who executes a writing proposed as a contract under a mistake as to its contents is bound.here,however,ramos is not attempting to avoid the arbitration agreement because of his limited understanding of the english language.rather,he is relying on the fact that pena motors provided him with what purported to be a spanish translation of the english contract he was being asked to sign,a spanish translation which did not contain the arbitration agreement.
the trial court made a factual finding that the ramos translation was a true and correct copy of the one ramos was given and that the spanish language translation of the risc provided to ramos at the time of the auto purchase transaction did not include an arbitration provision.as a result of its factual findings,the trial court concluded,by operation of section,that westlake failed to establish the existence of an arbitration provision.we agree with the trial court ruling denying the motion to compel arbitration but affirm on a different ground raised by ramos,but not explicitly addressed by the trial court there was no mutual assent because the arbitration agreement was hidden in the english contract and not included in the ramos translation.this
