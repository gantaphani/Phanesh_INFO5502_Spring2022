opinion of the court 
in this case we consider for the first time the interplay between the fair credit reporting act fcra,and the higher education act of hea,with respect to the responsibilities of an institution of higher education that furnishes information on student loan indebtedness to a consumer reporting agency cra.edward seamans appeals an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,which granted summary judgment to defendant temple university temple on seamans claims for negligent and willful violations of fcra in connection with temple reporting of certain information to cras concerning seamans student loan.for the following reasons,we will vacate and remand.
on january,seamans received a federal perkins loan the loan of from temple.the first payment on the loan was due on january.upon seamans failure to make payment within the grace period,the loan was declared delinquent on february.on august,with the full balance of the loan still unpaid,temple notified seamans that the account had been placed for collection.
in january,seamans enrolled as a student at drexel university.in the spring of,seamans sought financial aid in the form of a pell grant,but drexel refused to provide seamans with financial assistance until he repaid the balance of the loan.on april,seamans repaid the loan in full.
in may,allegedly for the first time in many years,seamans noticed a trade line on his credit report summarizing data pertaining to the loan.for reasons unknown,that trade line may or may not have actually appeared on seamans credit report at the times it indisputably should have namely,between february and april,when the account was in default.because seamans claim is predicated only on temple conduct after he disputed the trade line,whether and how temple reported information about the loan before seamans lodged his dispute is irrelevant.
what is not in dispute is that in the aftermath of seamans repayment of the loan,temple reported certain data to transunion,a cra.we observe at the outset that much reporting of consumer credit data,including the bulk of the reporting by temple in this case,takes the form of codes rather than text.for the sake of clarity,we refer primarily to the underlying interpretations of the codes,which are undisputed,rather than to the codes themselves.relevant categories of coded information include the date of first delinquency,which refers to the initial date upon which the loan had been marked as defaulted the payment history,which documents the debtor payment record the account status,which documents a particular status for a given debt,including whether an account is open,closed,paid,or unpaid and the compliance condition,which indicates whether the reported information is disputed by the consumer.
in the aftermath of seamans payment,temple had provided the following information to transunion 
a seamans had been over days late for at least months prior to the time the perkins l oan was paid in full 
b the account status was report ed as current paid or paying as agreed 
c the balance was report ed as 
d the high balance was report ed as 
e the terms was report ed as monthly 
f the date open was report ed as and 
g the date closed was report ed as.
app.temple did not report the date of first delinquency for the loan,february,and also did not report that the account had ever been placed for collection.
on may and may,seamans formally disputed portions of that information by contacting transunion.seamans may dispute,which he submitted online,stated 
loan defaulted.temple did report in a decade,and charged off long ago.i paid temple on,they retroactively reported years of late payments,but it had been co.nothing from temple was on my report until i fully paid to close account.why does report show two years of late payments 
app.seamans may dispute was made by telephone.transunion in turn notified temple of the may and may disputes and asked it to verify,among other things,the payment history profile and account status of the loan.
in response,temple,through its loan servicer,acs education services,acs,conducted an investigation.acs had contracted with temple to respond to consumer disputes on temple behalf in exchange for per dispute received and processed by acs.the procedure followed by acs in these investigations was essentially to verify that the reported data was in fact consistent with temple internal documentation pertaining to the loan 
on may,temple resubmitted the information to transunion virtually unchanged.again,temple did not indicate when the loan first became delinquent or that it had ever been placed for collection.nor did temple report by way of a compliance condition code that seamans now disputed the trade line.
on august,seamans contacted temple,transunion,and another cra,equifax,again to dispute the continued appearance of temple trade line on his credit report.seamans letter to transunion stated 
in i received a perkins loan while attending temple university.i defaulted on the loan and the loan went to collection.no activity occurred on the account for some time,and the account eventually came off my credit reports for all three of the reporting agencies.i recently began attending school again at drexel university,and in order to qualify for financial aid,i had to settle the perkins loan default.i walked into temple billing department and paid dollars sic on the spot,receiving a letter on temple university letterhead that the debt was settled.temple went on to retroactively report two years worth of day late payments to the credit reporting agencies.it is important to note that there was no reporting on this account to the credit bureaus for many years,and then suddenly after the debt was paid,temple reported two years worth of late payments all at once.i previously disputed this online,and received a letter stating that the creditor has reviewed the account and wishes to make no further adjustment to my credit record.
to put it plainly,i want the temple university account removed from my credit report.the account is closed,and well beyond the time limit imposed for the reporting of derogatory credit information.therefore,it should not appear on my credit reports now.i have been a good consumer for years now,and the temple reporting instantly negatively impacted my trans union score by approximately points.
app.temple was notified of the august dispute and received copies of the letters written by seamans to transunion and equifax.after a second investigation,temple modified certain elements of its report on the loan but still did not report the loan history in collections,a date of first delinquency,or the fact that seamans was disputing the accuracy of the reported information.
seamans points to evidence that temple with respect to certain information about the loan was not unique.for example,an acs employee testified at deposition that at least until late,acs policy was that its employees would never flag an account as disputed,regardless of the nature of the consumer challenge 
q let go to the document acs again.within acs can you point me to any particular portion of it which relates to reporting an account as disputed by the consumer in the compliance condition code portion of the metro code 
a no,there is not.
q and is the reason for that because up until november of,acs did not report accounts as disputed to credit reporting agencies whether affirmatively or after a dispute had been received 
app.the same employee explained that acs never included dates of first delinquency in its reports even after disputes were lodged.app.a different customer service representative from acs testified at deposition that she spent an average of minutes on any given dispute and that acs provided no written guidelines or formal training from managers for her.app.
on october,seamans filed a complaint against temple in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,alleging that temple negligently or willfully violated fcra with respect to its reporting of the loan.on may,temple moved for summary judgment,arguing in essence that hea exempted it from compliance with fcra because the credit instrument at issue was a perkins loan.on october,the district court granted the motion in full and entered judgment on the following day in favor of temple.seamans appeals from that judgment.

seamans brings this action under and,which permit private suits for damages against parties who willfully or negligently fail to comply with certain duties to consumers under fcra.specifically,seamans contends that temple investigation of his claims was unreasonable,and that even after he had lodged a detailed written dispute with transunion,temple continued to omit the loan history in collections,its date of first delinquency,and even the fact of his dispute itself.he claims that these violations caused him to suffer actual damages in the form of lost credit opportunities,harm to credit reputation and credit score,and emotional distress.he also seeks punitive damages under u.for the violations that he contends were willful.
resolution of this appeal requires us to consider several discrete issues.in part iii of this opinion we address the extent of temple duties under fcra as a furnisher of credit information,and whether hea materially impacts those duties.in part iv a,we decide whether seamans has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the completeness and accuracy of temple filings and the reasonableness of temple investigative and corrective procedures.next,in part iv b,we consider temple claim that fcra does not permit private citizens such as seamans to sue for damages caused by a furnisher failure to mark an account as disputed.finally,in part iv c,we address whether seamans has stated a claim under for willful fcra violations that,if proved,would allow him to recover punitive damages.
fcra,enacted in,created a regulatory framework governing consumer credit reporting.that framework was crafted to protect consumers from the transmission of inaccurate information about them,and to establish credit reporting practices that utilize accurate,relevant,and current information in a confidential and responsible manner.cortez trans union,llc,cir quotation marks omitted.under fcra,cras collect consumer credit data from furnishers,such as banks and other lenders,and organize that material into individualized credit reports,which are used by commercial entities to assess a particular consumer creditworthiness.
fcra imposes a variety of obligations on both furnishers and cras.for instance,to protect consumers from having their credit forever impaired by aging debts,cras are precluded from reporting accounts which have been placed for collection or charged to profit and loss more than seven years prior to the report.a.other adverse item s of information,aside from criminal convictions,also may be reported only for seven years after the adverse event.id.a.when the threshold for these items is reached,cras may no longer lawfully report that data in industry parlance,it has aged off the consumer credit report.
when a furnisher provides information to a cra regarding an account placed for collection or charged to profit or loss,the furnisher then has days in which to notify the cra of the account date of delinquency,which is defined as the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the account that immediately preceded the action.id.a a.the date of delinquency enables the cra to calculate the window for purposes without it,the cra would be unable to determine when the account had been placed for collection,rendering the date impossible to calculate 
temple concedes that under these provisions,if a loan had been first marked delinquent in early and placed for collection later that year,a furnisher would be obligated to report those facts under a a.consistent with the terms of a,the trade line would have aged off the consumer credit report at some point in.
hea,enacted in and amended repeatedly thereafter,contains a provision that instructs cras to disregard fcra provisions when reporting data on certain federally backed education loans.see c.this section provides as follows 
notwithstanding paragraphs and of subsection a of section of title,a consumer reporting agency may make a report containing information received from an institution regarding the status of a borrower account on a loan made under this part until the loan is paid in full.
id.the upshot of this provision is that a defaulted perkins loan,if left unpaid,can remain on a person credit report indefinitely it does not age off a person credit report after seven years by operation of law the bill legislative history explains the underlying rationale of that provision 
these changes represent a simplification effort and provide consistency between the statute of limitations for collecting loans and the period for reporting negative credit information.the committee believes that reporting of defaulted loans to credit bureaus is an effective tool and should be available to institutions and the secretary of education for the entire period that loan collection is allowed.
we now consider whether the reporting obligations of temple,a furnisher of consumer credit data under fcra,are affected by.c.when,as here,the question is one of statutory construction,the appropriate starting place is with the statutory text.when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then,this first canon of statutory construction is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.bank germain,d quotation marks omitted.
the text of hea is unambiguous in a crucial respect namely,it refers only to cras 
notwithstanding paragraphs and of subsection a of section of title,a consumer reporting agency may make a report containing information received from an institution of higher education regarding the status of a borrower account on a loan made under this part until the loan is paid in full.
c emphasis added.the text does not mention furnishers of consumer credit data.
temple primary argument is that despite the absence of a specific reference to furnishers,hea nonetheless functionally compels educational institutions to omit the date of first delinquency and collection history when reporting perkins loans to cras.this is based on temple worry that if it had continuously reported the loan full history,including the items at issue such as collection history and date of delinquency,the cras may have failed to notice that the loan was an education loan and instead may have treated the loan as a defaulted debt.under that scenario,according to temple,the cras may have mistakenly allowed the loan to age off seamans credit report in.temple rationalizes that by simply omitting from its report all facts that could trigger the aging off provisions,temple was helping the cras comply with c and,in practice,furthering the congressional intent to prevent unpaid student loans from aging off credit reports.
as an initial matter,we find it difficult to credit the implicit suggestion that temple had no avenue,whether through the intricate coding system described above or in some other way,by which to signal affirmatively to the cras that a given loan is an education loan.in other words,surely temple could have allayed its own concerns about the cras possible mischaracterization of the loan by providing them with more information rather than less.
nevertheless,whether this is the case or not,the question of whether a particular loan should or should not age off a credit report must be answered by the cras,and not by furnishers such as temple.if cra procedures had allowed the loan trade line to expire in,in possible contravention of c,that would be the cras statutory concern,not an excuse for temple to report loan information in an incomplete or inaccurate manner.as stated recently by the supreme court,even the most formidable argument concerning the statute purposes could not overcome the clarity we find in the statute text.kloeckner solis,d.the strange described by temple is not present in the statutory text at issue and we decline to read such a procedure into it.
temple also notes its belief that any loan fully repaid according to its original schedule will remain on a person credit report for years after final payment thus a good borrower could take out an education loan and fully pay the loan on schedule in years,but would then carry the trade line on her credit report for years afterward.temple claims that under seamans reading of fcra and hea,a bad borrower who took out a federal education loan and immediately defaulted could then pay the loan years later and see the trade line expunged immediately,because it would be more than years past the date when the loan was sent for collection.the good borrower thereby carries the trade line on her credit report for more time years than the bad borrower years.temple suggests that this inequity is a good reason to interpret the relevant statutes in its favor.
temple has provided no evidence,however,that the appearance of a payment history,the one appearing on the good borrower credit report,would impair the good borrower credit score.there is nothing to show,in other words,that these disparate outcomes are inequitable to the good borrower at all.indeed,frca itself reflects a policy choice to allow dated adverse credit data to age off a credit report because such information might otherwise indefinitely hamper the borrowing capabilities of individuals.credit information,by contrast,can be reported indefinitely at least in part because it demonstrates that a person has been a reliable borrower in the past and will presumably continue to be such in the future.
we thus disagree with the district court conclusion that.c effectively exempts the loan from fcra aging off provision indefinitely.instead,the statutory text of.c makes clear that the window described in a is extended only until the loan is paid in full.accordingly,once seamans loan had been repaid,the trade line pertaining to the loan should have aged off his credit report pursuant to a,because the loan by that time had been placed for collection more than seven years prior.in reality,however,the trade line did not age off,and it did not age off because temple never provided the cras with the collection history and date of delinquency.instead,temple incomplete and misleading reporting made it appear as if seamans had simply made a late repayment on a loan in,which,under a,could be recorded on his credit report until.
under the reading of hea advanced by temple,a borrower such as seamans,who initially defaults on an education loan and then later repays it,is penalized twice once because the loan,if unpaid,will not be removed from his credit report,and twice,because even after payment,the loan trade line will persist for another seven years.we find this consequence to be inconsistent with congress expressed intent that reporting of defaulted education loans to credit bureaus is an effective tool and should be available to institutions for the entire period that loan collection is allowed,at.the first penalty,to be sure,is an effective tool indeed,providing great motivation for a borrower to repay even very old education loans.the second penalty,however,reaches beyond the period that loan collection is allowed,and serves little purpose.once the debt is paid,the threat that the negative payment history will persist for another seven years as adverse information gives the borrower no further motivation he has already done everything in his power to satisfy the debt.
in sum,both a straightforward reading of the statutory text and an assessment of the legislative intent compel the conclusion that hea did not exempt temple,as a furnisher,from its typical reporting obligations under frca.we conclude that furnishers of consumer credit data remain obligated to report fully and accurately under fcra regarding the collection history and date of delinquency for even an education loan.
we now address whether seamans has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding his claim that temple negligently failed to conduct a reasonable investigation and thereafter failed to correct inaccurate and incomplete reporting as to the loan.section authorizes consumers to bring suit for damages caused by a furnisher negligent breach of its duties to consumers under b see simmsparris countrywide fin,cir.although furnishers such as temple are obligated to provide complete and accurate information to cras even in the first instance,before a dispute,under a,fcra explicitly precludes private suits for failure to comply with that statutory duty.c,and instead provides for enforcement of that provision by federal and state officials,d.the claims here are thus predicated solely on temple conduct after it was informed of seamans dispute by transunion.
we have previously held that a furnisher investigation into a consumer complaint must be reasonable,simmsparris,at,but did not expound upon what that standard requires.we have recognized,though,that cras also are required to follow reasonable procedures with respect to the accuracy of consumer data under frca,see b and in that similar context we have explained that a reasonable procedure is one that a reasonably prudent person would undertake under the circumstances.cortez,at quoting philbin trans union,cir.that issue is normally a question for trial unless the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the procedures is beyond question.id.quotation marks omitted.
we also stated in cortez that when assessing reasonableness,the factfinder must balance the potential harm from inaccuracy against the burden of safeguarding against such inaccuracy.id.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit has explicitly defined a furnisher duty in similar terms.see johnson mbna am.bank,na,cir holding that the reasonableness of a furnisher investigation involves weighing the cost of verifying the accuracy of the information versus the possible harm of reporting inaccurate information quotation marks omitted see also van veen equifax,d,applying johnson.we join our sister circuit in holding that the same balancing test we applied in cortez with respect to the reasonableness of a cra procedures applies to investigations conducted by furnishers as well.
other courts of appeals have evaluated the reasonableness of a furnisher investigative procedure as it relates to the content of the notice of dispute sent by the cra to the furnisher for instance,where a given notice contains only scant or vague allegations of inaccuracy,a more limited investigation may be warranted.see boggio usaa fed.sav.bank,cir chiang verizon new england,cir gorman wolpoff abramson,llp,cir westra credit control of pinellas,cir.likewise,i f a cra fails to provide all relevant information to a furnisher,then the consumer has a private cause of action against the cra,a a,but not against the furnisher.chiang,at.we agree that this too is an important factor in assessing the reasonableness of a furnisher investigation.
the meaning of completeness and accuracy in the specific context of a furnisher duties under fcra is also a matter of first impression in this court.it is not seriously debated,however,that factually incorrect information is inaccurate for purposes of fcra.see,boggio,at.and we agree with the three courts of appeal
