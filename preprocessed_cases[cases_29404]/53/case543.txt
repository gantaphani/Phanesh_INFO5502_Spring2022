background 
this particular case involves the determination of the dumping margin for imports of atlantic fresh,farmed salmon from the republic of chile by mares australes 
on july,commerce,in response to a petition filed by appellee coalition for fair atlantic salmon trade fast and its individual members,initiated an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether chilean exporters of atlantic fresh,farmed salmon were selling that subject merchandise in the united states at less than fair value.initiation of antidumping duty investigation fresh atlantic salmon from chile.july.
on august,commerce determined that it could not individually examine all chilean producers and exporters of atlantic fresh salmon.as authorized by c,the agency accordingly limited its antidumping investigation to mares australes and four other leading chilean salmon producers and exporters collectively,respondents.see notice of preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value and postponement of final determination fresh atlantic salmon from chile,preliminary results.
the purpose of an antidumping investigation is to determine whether dumping duties should be imposed on subject merchandise when it is imported into the united states.under the antidumping statute,commerce is required to impose antidumping duties on subject merchandise that is being,or is likely to be,sold in the united states at less than its fair value to the detriment of a domestic industry.
commerce determines those duties by first calculating the dumping margin for the subject merchandise,the total amount by which the price charged for a corresponding foreign like product in the home market or market the normal value exceeds the price charged for the subject merchandise in the united states the united states price.a see also b in other words,to determine whether antidumping duties should be imposed,commerce must make a fair comparison between the united states price charged for the subject merchandise here,fresh atlantic salmon and the price charged for the corresponding foreign like product in the home market the normal value.a.to make this comparison commerce must determine the normal value of the foreign like product.
when as here no satisfactory exporting country price is available,the antidumping statute authorizes commerce to base normal value on the sales price of the foreign like product in a market,that is,the price at which the foreign like product is so sold or offered for sale for consumption in a country other than the exporting country or the united states a b ii.in this case,commerce based the normal value of the foreign like product sold by mares australes and two other respondents on those companies sales of atlantic fresh salmon to japan,which commerce determined was the appropriate comparison market.preliminary results.at.
in addition to determining the appropriate comparison market,commerce must also identify the foreign like product that is to be compared to the subject merchandise exported to the united states.section of the antidumping statute specifically defines foreign like product,in turn,as 
m erchandise in the first of the following categories in respect of which a determination for the purposes of part ii of this subtitle can be satisfactorily made 
a the subject merchandise and other merchandise which is identical in physical characteristics with,and was produced in the same country by the same person as,that merchandise.
b merchandise 
i produced in the same country and by the same person as the subject merchandise,
ii like that merchandise in component material or materials and in the purposes for which used,and 
iii approximately equal in commercial value to that merchandise.
c merchandise 
i produced in the same country and by the same person and of the same general class or kind as the subject merchandise,
ii like that merchandise in the purposes for which used,and 
iii which the administering authority determines may reasonably be compared with that merchandise.
emphasis added.that definition is applicable to a b.see skf usa,united states.in this case commerce used the definition set forth in subsection a of to define the foreign like product.in other words,commerce sought to identify salmon sold by mares australes to japan that was identical in physical characteristics to salmon exported by that company to the united states.it is commerce interpretation of the phrase identical in physical characteristics that is at issue.
to determine japanese merchandise which is identical in physical characteristics,a,to the subject merchandise sold in the united states,commerce with agreement of all parties used three matching criteria based on the physical characteristics of the salmon form,grade,and weight band.preliminary results.at.it is the second grade,or quality,of the is relevant here all parties agree that there are no uniform international or national grading standards or requirements for fresh atlantic salmon.but the association of chilean salmon and trout exporters association,of which mares australes is a member,has promulgated certain minimum grading criteria that its members are required to adopt.the association recognizes and mares australes during the review period adopted four grades for fresh atlantic whole salmon.in descending order of quality,there are premium grade one industrial.during the review period,mares australes sold and premium grade salmon to japan,but did not sell grade salmon to the united states.and mares australes was the only respondent to sell both and premium grade salmon to japan during the review period.notice of final determination of sales at less than fair value fresh atlantic salmon from chile,june,final results.
before commerce issuance of its preliminary results,mares australes argued that the salmon it sold to japan could not be considered identical in physical characteristics,a,to the premium grade salmon it sold to the united states.as evidence of this distinction,the company stressed that association promulgated higher grading standards for than premium salmon that certain physical defects such as external lacerations to the salmon were present in premium but not salmon that salmon enjoyed a darker,redder color than premium salmon and that its customers in japan,recognizing these physical and color distinctions,paid higher prices for salmon.the color differences were particularly emphasized by mares australes.
in a january,memorandum to the parties,commerce preliminarily accepted mares australes argument that bona fide physical differences existed between and premium salmon,stating 
we have examined the evidence on the record to determine preliminarily whether there is a bona fide distinction between and premium merchandise.we have found that the evidence supports that such a distinction was drawn during the review period by the association,as well as by japanese customers.this evidence includes a the association grading criteria,b specifications issued by japanese customers for salmon with a color rating higher than that required by the premium standard,and c labels used for packages of salmon that specifically refer to the grade.
in its preliminary results,commerce again noted that c ertain respondents contend that,in the japanese market,there is a distinction between premium and salmon.while we have accepted this claim for the preliminary determination,we intend to examine this issue thoroughly at verification.preliminary results.at.
in other words,for purposes of the preliminary results,commerce compared the prices charged by mares australes for premium salmon in the united states only to the prices charged for premium salmon in japan.the exclusion from the price comparison of the higher prices charged for salmon in japan of course affected commerce preliminary calculation of mares australes dumping margin for the review period.in its preliminary results,commerce assigned to mares australes a weighted average dumping margin for its sales of salmon in the united states during the review period.preliminary results.at.because this was less than,commerce considered it de minimis b,and the preliminary results effectively exempted mares australes from the assessment of any dumping duties.
in its final results,however,commerce changed course and determined that salmon was identical in physical characteristics,a,to salmon.it stated 
after conducting verification and carefully considering the evidence on the record,we have concluded that any differences between premium and salmon are so minor as to not warrant separate classification in an antidumping analysis.
final results.at.
in reaching this conclusion,commerce recognized that mares australes reported higher prices for sales of grade salmon to japan.id.and commerce recognized that the association grading standards specified distinct premium and grades.id.but commerce noted that the record also contains evidence that the distinctions between the two grades were,in practice,nominal.id.with regard to the alleged distinction in color between the two grades of salmon,for example,commerce observed that respondents routinely export to the united states salmon that has the same meat color as salmon exported to japan,and accordingly concluded that respondents do not consider the criterion color that was initially claimed to be of paramount significance in distinguishing between and premium salmon.id.
commerce also discounted minor physical differences between salmon of the two grades,such as small scale loss or light lacerations,stating that these minor differences do not establish a different grade of salmon for purposes of our analysis.id.and commerce observed that mares australes sales of premium salmon to japan covered only a few months during the period of investigation and involved relatively small quantities.id.at.thus,commerce concluded that the sales of premium salmon were an insufficient basis on which to find systematic price differences between the two labels,much less to employ a matching methodology based on such differences.id.
as support for its conclusion that was not a commercially recognized separate grade,commerce also pointed to commercial practice in countries other than chile exporting to japan,whose salmon industries did not recognize any grade higher than superior.final results.at.commerce stated in pertinent part that 
while the chilean respondents that sell to both the united states and japan may sort their harvest based on the premise that japanese customers are more likely to take notice of a light defect than customers,such differences are not recognized by the salmon producers of any other nation that exports to japan.the norwegian,scottish,canadian,and farmed salmon industries do not recognize any grade higher than superior.the superior grade is consistent with the premium grade and permits minor defects because the grading standards of superior salmon recognized by the world largest salmon farming countries provide for a range of quality we note that,by definition,there will be some merchandise within this grade with no imperfections nonetheless,all salmon in this range are graded equally,as superior premium,and are comparable products in the market place.
id.at.commerce thus determined that salmon reported as are in fact of premium grade,and accordingly compared the respondents sales of both and premium salmon to japan to corresponding sales of premium salmon only in the united states.id.at.
the practical consequences of commerce decision to classify the two grades of salmon as identical in physical characteristics,a,was to increase mares australes dumping margin from the de minimis level established in the preliminary results to a final dumping margin of.compare preliminary results.at with final results.at.
on review,the court of international trade upheld commerce determination,reasoning first that the phrase identical in physical characteristics,as used in the antidumping statute,is an ambiguous term because,in pertinent part,the statute does not direct commerce how to decide whether merchandise is identical in physical characteristics.pesquera mares australes,wl,at.and the court next determined that commerce decision to treat the two grades at issue as a single grade was a reasonable interpretation of the statute that was entitled to deference under chevron.id.at.
in reaching this result,the court also rejected mares australes argument that commerce improperly considered evidence of commercial practice in making its final determination.the court concluded that 
the statute on its face does not prohibit commerce evaluation of industry standards when determining whether particular products are identical moreover,the court can not find,and pesquera does not supply,any authority which restricts evidence to the individual producer standards commerce consideration of industry standards is reasonable because industry standards indicate what most salmon producers consider to be identical merchandise.
id.at.the court accordingly sustained the portions of the final results pertaining to commerce decision to treat and premium grade salmon as identical merchandise.id.at.this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
this court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a.when reviewing determinations made by commerce,this court applies anew the standard of review applied by the court of international trade in its review of the administrative record.micron,united states,quoting de cecco di filippo fara martino united states.in doing so,we uphold commerce determination unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i.
we first turn our attention to the standard of review to be afforded to the antidumping determination at issue.the question is whether we should review the questions of statutory interpretation involved here under the traditional chevron analysis chevron,natural resources defense council,d,or under the less deferential regime set forth in skidmore swift.see united states mead,d.we conclude that chevron deference is afforded to commerce statutory interpretations as to the appropriate methodology,and therefore we do not reach the question whether commerce statutory interpretations could withstand review under the less deferential skidmore regime.
where commerce has adopted a regulation by rulemaking pursuant to the administrative procedure act,the chevron standard,of course,applies.see mead,at.at united states haggar apparel,d.
in many past cases,however,we have afforded chevron deference to commerce antidumping determinations even when as here there is no applicable regulation.in thai pineapple public,united states,cert.denied,d,for example,we held that commerce reliance on certain cost allocation methodologies provided by thai fruit producers to calculate those producers dumping margins was entitled to chevron deference.in reaching that conclusion,we reasoned in pertinent part 
antidumping investigations are complex and complicated matters in which commerce has particular expertise and thus commerce determinations are entitled to deference.see chevron.we conclude,therefore,that commerce reliance on the books and records of the thai fruit producers was reasonable.
id.at.other decisions of this court before mead similarly afforded chevron deference to commerce determinations even when no formal regulation was at issue.see,micron,united states,holding that commerce interpretation of d d in the administrative decision under review is reasonable,and therefore entitled to deference under chevron torrington united states,holding that we must defer to commerce method of applying the antidumping laws to exempt the merchandise at issue here from antidumping duties if that method is based on a reasonable construction of the pertinent statutes citing chevron,at.koyo seiko,united states,affording chevron deference to commerce methodology,because congress delegation of authority empowers commerce to choose in the manner in which the pertinent merchandise shall be selected.chevron applies in such a situation.
the supreme court recent decision in mead does not change our obligation to afford chevron deference to commerce interpretations of ambiguous statutory terms articulated in the course of commerce antidumping determinations.
we understand mead to clearly recognize that chevron deference is not limited to regulations adopted after rulemaking.the line that mead draws is not defined with great clarity.however,we conclude that chevron deference is due at least to those statutory interpretations that are articulated in any relatively formal administrative procedure,mead,at.at,where congress has provided for agency resolution of rights,subject to deferential judicial review whether such judicial review involves direct review of the agency,and whether it is confined to review on the administrative record and those interpretations are embodied in rulings that are given precedential effect by the agency.that much appears from the mead decision itself.
in mead,the supreme court reaffirmed the principle that 
an administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.
id.at.chevron deference is due if the agency generally conferred authority and other statutory circumstances shows that congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law id.at.the court also noted that d elegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways,as by an agency power to engage in adjudication or notice and comment rulemaking,or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.id.at emphasis added.mead found a very good indicator of delegation meriting chevron treatment in express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed.id.at.the precedential nature of agency determinations,while not sufficient to add up to chevron entitlement,mead,at.at,militates in favor of the application of chevron.
and mead makes clear that the agency power to engage in adjudication,id.at,may be exercised in an administrative procedure that is only relatively formal.id.at.as an example of such an administrative procedure,mead cites to nationsbank of north carolina,variable annuity life insurance,d.mead,at.at.in that case,a single bank sought approval from the comptroller of the currency to act as an agent in the sale of annuities.the comptroller granted the bank application,concluding that the national bank act permitted banks to broker annuities.nationsbank,at.the supreme court in nationsbank afforded chevron deference to the comptroller statutory interpretation,noting that a s the administrator charged with supervision of the national bank act,the comptroller bears primary responsibility for surveillance of the business of banking.id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted.
in contrast,mead concludes that administrative determinations such as customs rulings do not draw chevron deference because congress has not provided for deferential judicial review of those determinations.in mead,for example,the court noted in pertinent part that congress had explicitly provided for independent review of customs classifications by the court of international trade.at.at.this statutory prescription of independent judicial review of those administrative determinations led the court to conclude that i t is hard to imagine a congressional understanding more at odds with the chevron regime.id.in addition,the customs classification rulings had been expressly denied precedential effect by customs.see mead,at.at citing.
the antidumping proceedings conducted by commerce may of course be fairly characterized as relatively formal administrative procedure s that adjudicate parties rights.mead,at.at.congress,for example,explicitly delegated authority to commerce to review and determine the amount of any antidumping duty and to publish in the federal register the results of such a review,together with notice of any duty to be assessed,estimated duty to be deposited,or investigation to be resumed.a b c congress has also provided that the court of international trade should review commerce antidumping determinations for substantial evidence,based on the administrative record.b b i,b a.commerce routinely considers the legal interpretations announced in its prior antidumping and countervailing duty determinations to be precedential.see,cooking ware from mexico final results of antidumping duty administrative review,relying on prior antidumping determinations that set forth commerce long standing policy on treatment of certain interest deductions by foreign exporters.so too does the court of international trade and this court.see british steel plc united states,sustaining commerce abandonment of its methodologies in countervailing duty investigation only because the agency demonstrated that it was necessary to abandon those particular methodologies.commerce decisions are,moreover,that is,binding without the need for judicial enforcement,another indication of chevron entitlement.in short,commerce antidumping determinations are adjudication s that produce rulings for which deference under chevron is claimed.mead,at.at.
indeed,since the mead decision,we have explicitly recognized that chevron deference is due to such administrative rulings,even when there is no formal regulation at issue.in american silicon technologies united states,for example,we deferred to commerce reliance on certain depreciation expenses provided by a foreign importer to calculate that importer dumping margin.in reaching that conclusion,we reasoned in pertinent part that 
neither the antidumping statute nor the statement of administrative action instructs commerce as to the methodology it must use to establish depreciation expenses in constructed value calculation.consequently,our review focuses on whether commerce was reasonable in accepting the depreciation methodology at issue.
id.at citing mead,at.at,and chevron,at.emphasis in original.
in sum,we conclude,in accordance with our recent decision in american silicon technologies,that statutory interpretations articulated by commerce during its antidumping proceedings are entitled to judicial deference under chevron.we now turn to the merits of this appeal.
this case requires us to interpret the phrase identical in physical characteristics as that phrase appears in the definition of foreign like product in a.in order to ascertain the established meaning,nsk united states,of a term such as the word identical,it is appropriate to consult dictionaries.see int l bus.machs.united states,best power tech.sales austin.
