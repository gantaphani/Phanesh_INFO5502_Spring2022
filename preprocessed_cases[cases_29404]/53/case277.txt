heading covers s oups and broths and preparations therefor.the soups and broths portion of this heading is an eo nomine provision,that is,a provision that describes an article by a specific name,not by use.camelbak,llc united states.the government does not contend that aromont flavorings are classifiable under the eo nomine provision covering soups and broths.instead,the government contends that the flavorings are preparations for soups and broths covered by the principal use provision preparations therefor.
principal use provisions are governed by ari a,which provides that 
i n the absence of special language or context which otherwise requires a tariff classification controlled by use other than actual use is to be determined in accordance with the use in the united states at,or immediately prior to,the date of importation,of goods of that class or kind to which the imported goods belong,and the controlling use is the principal use.
principal use in this context has been defined as the use which exceeds any other single use.lenox collections united states,citing conversion of the tariff schedules of the united states annotated into the nomenclature structure of the harmonized system submitting report uscit pub.june.
in primal lite,united states,we construed ari a to call for a determination as to the group of goods that are commercially fungible with the imported goods,the socalled carborundum factors provide guidance in determining what goods are commercially fungible with the imported goods.see benq am.united states.these factors include use in the same manner as merchandise which defines the class the general physical characteristics of the merchandise the economic practicality of so using the import the expectation of the ultimate purchasers the channels of trade in which the merchandise moves the environment of the sale,such as accompanying accessories and the manner in which the merchandise is advertised and displayed and the recognition in the trade of this use.united states carborundum,ccpa.here,the parties dispute the application of the pertinent factors,as follows.
actual use.the government argues that t he actual use of an imported article is irrelevant to classification in a principal use tariff provision.appellant br.thus,it contends that the trial court erred in predicating its decision primarily on the actual use of the merchandise.the government points out that under the htsus,there are two separate types use provisions one for determining an article actual use and the other for determining the principal use of articles of its kind.the government theorizes that the two provisions must be different from each other and that actual use must therefore be pertinent only to the actual use provision.
we reject the government argument.in carborundum,the court recognized the relevance of the use,if any,in the same manner as merchandise which defines the class.at see also maher app united states,ccpa baldwin,concurring nor will proof that the merchandise in question was actually used for the purpose be sufficient,although it will be relevant.in primal lite,we weighed heavily the actual use of the imports in question in determining the group of goods that were commercially fungible with the imported goods.at.specifically,in interpreting a principal use provision,we held that the imported goods did not consist of lighting sets of a kind used for christmas trees because an affidavit established that the principal use of the imported goods was not for christmas trees,and the government provided no evidence that those goods and those commercially fungible with them are principally used for christmas trees.id.
to be sure,under actual use provisions of the htsus,imports are classified according to the actual use to which they are put in the united states if such use is intended at the time of importation,the goods are so used and proof thereof is furnished within years after the date the goods are entered.id.at quoting ari b.but there is no inconsistency in looking at actual use under both provisions.actual use of the imported goods is the only factor that is looked at under actual use provisions.in contrast,under principal use provisions,actual use of the particular imported goods is evidence of the principal use of the merchandise involved.actual use of the goods involved is but one of a number of factors,and perhaps one of the more important of the carborundum factors.
the other carborundum factors take account of the fact that a single item might be put to a use different than its ordinary use.primal lite,at the purpose of principal use provisions is to classify particular merchandise according to the ordinary use of such merchandise,even though particular imported goods may be put to some atypical use.see also clarendon,united states,pistorino,at.thus,a classification covering vehicles principally used for automobile racing would cover a race car,even if the particular imported car was actually used solely in an advertising display.primal lite,at.
the government also argues that even if actual use is relevant,as we have held,the evidence of actual use supplied by aromont is not relevant because it concerns the use of goods for years other than the year of importation.see ari a.the deposition testimony of terry wight wight,former vice president of sales and marketing of aromont,indicates,however,that the during the relevant time period,the imported products were always used as a flavor note,especially by industrial customers.see they purchased the aromont product as an ingredient that went into their sauces or gravies.almost to a tee,they bought it as a flavor pro
