background 
this case involves both antidumping and countervailing duty determinations,but the processes are similar for both types of determinations.responsibility for such determinations is shared between commerce and the international trade commission itc.in antidumping duty determinations,the statute charges commerce with determining whether dumping has occurred and,if so,the amount of antidumping duties that should be imposed.see id.the itc is charged with determining whether there has been material injury or a threat of material injury to a domestic industry.id.b.
antidumping duty determinations usually start when petitions are filed with commerce and the itc by or on behalf of a domestic industry c,b.if the petition submission satisfies the statutory requirements,an antidumping investigation is then commenced.see id.the itc,after receiving information from the domestic producers,makes a preliminary injury determination whether there is reasonable indication that an industry in the united states is materially injured,or is threatened with material injury id.a.after requesting and receiving information from foreign exporters and producers,commerce makes a preliminary determination as to the existence and extent of dumping and the amount of duties that should be imposed.see id.b,d.commerce preliminary determination is published in the federal register.f c.
entries of imported goods before the publication date of commerce preliminary determination are generally not subject to antidumping duties,but entries after that date are subject to such duties after the preliminary determination,importers are required to deposit referred to as a cash to cover the estimated antidumping duties d b.this is an estimate of the final duties,paid pending liquidation,which is the final computation or assessment of duties for a particular entry.mukand int l,united states,citing.
entries that have been liquidated can not be subjected to additional duties.in order to preserve the opportunity to impose duties on goods entered after the date of the preliminary determination,commerce suspends liquidation as to these entries in the preliminary determination.see d see also.
after further proceedings,if commerce makes a final determination that dumping has occurred and if the international trade commission makes a final determination of material injury,commerce issues a final antidumping order that determines which goods are subject to antidumping duties and their duty rate.duferco steel,citing a,d b,d c,b,c.however,this final determination addresses the existence of dumping only during a specified period of time before the preliminary determination a period used to determine the existence of dumping but not a period as to which duties are ultimately imposed.in other words,the final order does not in fact determine the existence of dumping during any period in which duties could be imposed or fix the duty rate for any goods.rather,the final order assumes that dumping continued after the preliminary order and such dumping will continue after the date of the final order.the final order like the preliminary order establishes a cash deposit rate,applicable to future entries starting from the date of the order.
the administering agencies periodically review whether dumping has in fact occurred,the amount of the duty,and the question of material injury.et.if no administrative review is requested,then commerce issues liquidation instructions to customs to assess duties at the cash deposit rate.c.if review is requested,commerce conducts an administrative review and retrospectively determines whether dumping has occurred and the final duty rates for the previously unliquidated entries subject to that review.a.in the course of the review,commerce also publishes the new cash deposit rates for future entries,equal to the administrative review final duty rates for earlier entries.b,a.additionally,upon request and as frequently as once a year,the itc will conduct a similar review of its finding of material injury.a,b.
the first review period,if review is requested,begins on the date of the preliminary determination and ends with the month before the anniversary month of the final antidumping determination order.see a kaye dunn,int l trade practice.every subsequent review,if requested,begins with the anniversary month of the final antidumping determination order and ends twelve months later.harvey kaye christopher dunn,international trade practice.finally,sunset determine whether the antidumping order should be conducted by commerce and the international trade commission at least once within the first five years of issuance of the final order,and then once every five years thereafter.c fag italia united states.
we have held that publication of the final results of an administrative review automatically lifts the suspension of liquidation for goods covered by that period.int l trading united states.after publication of the final results,commerce issues liquidation instructions to customs with respect to these goods,and customs liquidates them at the rate determined by the final administrative review order.a b see b see also consol.bearings united states.customs performs a ministerial function in executing these liquidation instructions.mitsubishi elecs,united states.
if judicial review of a final administrative review order is requested,the court of international trade may enjoin the liquidation of entries to prevent liquidation until judicial review is completed.c ugine alz belgium united states,arcelor iii.
the entries at issue in this case were made between the preliminary order and the end of the period for the first administrative review.the question is whether they were subject to duties under the first administrative review order.
