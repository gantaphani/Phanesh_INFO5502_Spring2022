background 
on november,commerce issued its final determination in this case.shakeproof challenged the determination before the united states court of international trade,and disputed the methodology by which commerce calculated the value of the steel used to manufacture the washers.shakeproof argued that it was improper for commerce to determine the value of the steel based on the price paid for steel imported by zwg from the united kingdom.specifically,zwg purchased approximately of its steel from the united kingdom,and the remaining from domestic chinese producers.commerce established the normal value of of the steel based on the import price of the steel purchased from the united kingdom.shakeproof argued that the normal value of the domestically purchased chinese steel should instead be determined based on the factors of production using india as a surrogate country pursuant to c.
on july,the united states court of international trade remanded the case in order for commerce to further explain how its use of import prices to value the entire factor of production for steel wire rod promoted accuracy,including but not limited to how it was more accurate than the use of the surrogate value.shakeproof assembly components united states,d,shakeproof i.the trial court reasoned that w hether commerce use of imported prices to value an entire factor of production is reasonable is inextricably linked to whether the methodology promotes accuracy.id.at citing lasko metal,united states.
on september,commerce responded to the trial court remand order by issuing an additional explanation,entitled final results of redetermination on remand remand determination.the remand determination stated 
the purpose of the factors of production methodology is to determine what normal value would be if the producer costs were set by the market forces in a comparable economy.because the import price is an actual market price paid by the economy producer it provides a more accurate value than other potential surrogates.therefore,the actual price paid for the imports constitutes the best available information for valuing this factor.
commerce explained that,the actual price paid for inputs imported from a market economy in meaningful quantities is the best available information and promotes accuracy in the dumping calculation.commerce further stated that it would find imports meaningful if it could reasonably conclude from the quantities sold,and other aspects of the transactions,that the price paid is a reliable market economy value for the input.commerce indicated that,in the present case,zwg purchased of the steel from seven domestic chinese suppliers,and imported of the steel from the united kingdom.commerce also noted that the amount imported from the united kingdom exceeded the amounts purchased from any one of the seven domestic chinese suppliers.commerce determined that zwg imported meaningful amounts of identical steel from the united kingdom.moreover,commerce explained why the import price was more accurate than a surrogate value 
in economy countries we do not have market economy prices and,thus,are forced to resort to the best available information,which is often a surrogate value.at best,this surrogate value represents only an estimate of what a economy producer might pay for the factor in question if it were operating in a market economy setting.in this case,however,we have an actual,market economy price for steel wire rod paid by the economy producer in question.it is an actual price determined by market economy forces which has been paid to the market economy supplier by the respondent in convertible currency.thus,the actual market economy price is both reliable and accurate.
thus,commerce concluded that the united kingdom import price was a more reliable and more accurate basis for establishing the normal value of the domestic steel.
on june,the united states court of international trade affirmed the remand determination.shakeproof ii,d at.the trial court reasoned that the remand determination demonstrated how its use of import prices promotes accuracy.id.at.shakeproof timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.standard of review 
the court of international trade reviews commerce decision to determine whether it is unsupported by substantial evidence in the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i.we reapply this standard of review to commerce determination.cemex united states.
we review questions of statutory interpretation without deference.steel group united states.in reviewing an agency construction of a statute that it administers,this court addresses two questions as required by the supreme court decision in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.the first question is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if so,this court and the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,however,congress has not spoken directly on the issue,this court addresses the second question of whether the agency responsible for filling a gap in the statute has rendered an interpretation that is based on a permissible construction of the statute.see also united states mead,d micron,united states.in other words,commerce interpretation will not be set aside unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.

iii.discussion 
commerce decision to determine the normal value of all steel based on the purchase price of steel imported from the united kingdom is based on its interpretation of c.the statutory provision requires commerce to determine the normal value of merchandise exported from a economy country on the basis of the value of the factors of production utilized in producing the merchandise.c.specifically,the statute provides 
t he valuation of the factors of production shall be based on the best available information regarding the values of such factors in a market economy country or countries considered to be appropriate by the administering authority.
c emphasis added.in valuing the factors of production,the statute requires commerce to 
u tilize,to the extent possible,the prices or costs of fa
