the appellants,importers of computer parts,contend that their imported goods were taken without just compensation,in violation of the fifth amendment,when the government seized their goods upon importation and did not return them for a period of more than four years.the court of federal claims held that the appellants failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.acadia,united states.we affirm.
appellants acadia technology,and global win technology,collectively,acadia own the property at issue in this appeal,cooling fans for computer central processing units.acadia sought to import those goods into the united states in three shipments in october and february.
underwriters laboratories ul is a testing laboratory that examines and tests various products for compliance with safety standards.if ul finds that a manufacturer goods comply with applicable standards,ul authorizes the manufacturer to affix ul certification marks to its goods.the reverse ur is a certification mark that ul issues for electrical components of devices such as computer cooling fans.
section of the lanham act,forbids importation of merchandise which shall copy or simulate a registered trademark.section e of the tariff act of,e,provides that any merchandise bearing a counterfeit mark within the meaning of that is imported into the united states in violation of shall be seized and,in the absence of the written consent of the trademark owner,forfeited for violations of the customs laws.
in october,customs and border protection customs,acting pursuant to section e of the tariff act,detained a shipment of acadia cooling fans that bore the reverse ur mark.after receiving a letter from ul on october,stating that ul believed the use of the marks to be unauthorized and counterfeit,customs seized the fans.on february and,customs seized two more shipments of acadia cooling fans,again after receiving letters from ul stating that ul believed that the use of the reverse ur mark on the fans was unauthorized and counterfeit.according to the complaint,the three shipments of cooling fans had a total value of approximately when they were seized.
after customs seized the fans,it notified acadia of the seizure and advised acadia that it would initiate summary forfeiture proceedings unless acadia filed a claim of ownership.in letters dated april,and july,acadia requested that customs terminate the summary forfeiture proceedings.acadia submitted forms in which it requested that the matter be transferred to the department of justice for the institution of a judicial civil forfeiture action.
the matter was transferred to the department of justice in accordance with acadia request,but a forfeiture complaint was not promptly filed.on october,after a period of more than four years,the department of justice filed a civil forfeiture action in the united states district court for the northern district of california,seeking forfeiture of all three of acadia shipments.a year later,on october,the district court entered a stipulation and order of dismissal.under the terms of the order,the forfeiture action was dismissed.the stipulated dismissal provided that each party was to bear its own costs.the fans were thereafter returned to acadia.at that point,according to acadia complaint,the fans had become obsolete and their only value was as scrap,for which purpose they were worth only about.
after the dismissal of the forfeiture action,acadia filed this action in the court of federal claims,claiming the right to recover the difference between the value of the fans at the time they were seized and their value when they were returned.the government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.in its opposition to the government motion to dismiss,acadia conceded that the court of federal claims lacked jurisdiction over two of its claims,but it argued that the court had jurisdiction over its claim that the government actions violated the takings clause of the fifth amendment and that acadia was entitled to recover the loss in the value of the fans as just compensation for the taking.the court of federal claims granted the government motion to dismiss the takings claim for failure to state a claim,and acadia now appeals.
acadia argues that the government actions constituted a taking for two independent reasons.first,acadia argues that the seizure of its goods was a taking because it was not authorized by the statute under which customs seized acadia goods.second,acadia argues that the government delay of several years in initiating forfeiture proceedings was unreasonable and therefore constituted a taking regardless of whether the initial seizure was lawful.
with respect to the lawfulness of the original seizure,acadia contends that e,the statute on which customs relied to seize the cooling fans,applies only to counterfeit trademarks,and not to false certification marks such as the reverse ur mark at issue in this case.section e provides that any merchandise bearing a counterfeit mark within the meaning of section of title imported into the united states in violation of the provisions of section of title,shall be seized and forfeited for violations of the customs laws.e.section of title defines a mark to include any trademark,service mark,collective mark,or certification mark,and it defines counterfeit as a spurious mark,which is identical with,or substantially indistinguishable from,a registered mark.section of title provides,in pertinent part,that no article of imported merchandise which shall copy or simulate a trademark registered in accordance with the provisions of the lanham act shall be admitted to entry.acadia points to the use of the term trademark in section and argues that section and thus the seizure and forfeiture provisions of section e apply to trademarks,but not to certification marks.for that reason,acadia argues,the seizure of acadia cooling fans was unlawful and therefore compensable as a taking.
both the trial court in this case and the united states district court for the northern district of california in united states packaged computer towers,d,have disagreed with acadia construction of section e and have held that the statute applies to counterfeit certification marks as well as counterfeit trademarks.this court has never addressed that question,and it is unnecessary for us to do so here.for purposes of determining whether there has been a taking of acadia property without just compensation,it is unnecessary to determine whether section e applies to the particular goods at issue in this case.that is because a takings claim is separate from a challenge to the lawfulness of the government conduct a taking does not result simply because the government acted unlawfully,nor does a takings claim fail simply because the government conduct is subject to challenge as unlawful.
as we explained in rith energy,united states,an uncompensated taking and an unlawful government action constitute two separate wrongs that give rise to two separate causes of action.id.at quoting drilling programs,united states.a property owner is free either to sue in district court for asserted improprieties committed in the course of the challenged action or to sue for an uncompensated taking in the court of federal claims.id.as such 
i n a takings case we assume that the underlying action was lawful and we decide only whether the governmental action in question constituted a taking for which compensation must be paid.the appellant complaints about the wrongfulness of the government action are therefore not properly presented in the context of its takings claim.the only question before us is whether the appellant was entitled to be compensated for the effects of that action.
