appellant united states government appeals.we possess subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to a.we reverse.
background 
the instant appeal addresses whether particular products fall within the scope of existing antidumping and countervailing duty orders.as a result,we examine the orders scope,the description of the products in question,and the procedural history before turning to the merits.
i.the subject orders 
commerce generally investigates whether a foreign government or public entity provided a countervailable subsidy with respect to the manufacture,production,or export of merchandise that has entered the united states,a,and whether particular merchandise was sold in the united states at less than its fair value,id.at the conclusion of an investigation,if commerce and the international trade commission the itc make the requisite findings commerce publishes an order imposing duties on imported merchandise covered by the investigation.id.a,a.in each order,commerce must include a description of the subject merchandise in such detail as it deems necessary.id.a,a.
in,commerce published the orders.see aluminum extrusions from the people republic of china antidumping duty order,fed.reg.dep t of commerce may,aluminum extrusions from the people republic of china countervailing duty order,fed.reg.dep t of commerce may,the scope of the orders describes the subject merchandise as aluminum extrusions that are shapes and forms,produced by an extrusion process,made from specified aluminum alloys.antidumping duty order,fed.reg.at.the subject extrusions possess a wide variety of shapes and forms in a variety of finishes.id.the subject extrusions also may be described at the time of importation as parts for final finished products that are assembled after importation and may be identified with reference to their end use.id.at.
the orders scope contains several exclusions.in relevant part,the scope 
excludes finished goods containing aluminum extrusions that are entered unassembled in a finished goods kit.a finished goods kit is understood to mean a packaged combination of parts that contains,at the time of importation,all of the necessary parts to fully assemble a final finished good and requires no further finishing or fabrication,such as cutting or punching,and is assembled as is into a finished product.an imported product will not be considered a finished goods kit and therefore excluded from the scope of the orders merely by including fasteners such as screws,bolts,in the packaging with an aluminum extrusion product.
id.at.the instant appeal concerns whether meridian trim kits meet the terms of the finished goods kit exclusion.
ii.meridian trim kits 
b ecause the descriptions of subject merchandise in an order scope pertain to a class or kind of goods and therefore must be written in general terms,questions arise as to whether a particular product falls within the scope of an existing order.a see defining subject merchandise as the class or kind of merchandise that is within the scope of an order.congress has authorized commerce to issue scope rulings clarifying whether a particular type of merchandise is within the class or kind of merchandise described in an existing order.a b vi accord royal bus,united states,ccpa confirming commerce authority to issue scope rulings.an interested party may submit an application to commerce to obtain clarification about an order scope c see smith corona united states,fed.cir.explaining that scope rulings clarify the terms of the original order but do not modify or amend them.
meridian,the importer of the trim kits,asked commerce to issue a scope ruling that confirm s the kits do not fall within the orders scope.meridian described the trim kits as an aesthetic frame around the perimeter of though not attached to a major home kitchen appliance,such as a freezer or refrigerator.according to meridian,the t rim kits are sold as a package of finished parts and consist of extruded aluminum forms made from aluminum alloy covered by the orders scope.meridian further stated that t he trim kits also include a customer installation kit for the consumer to use during the final assembly in the residential kitchen,with the installation kit consisting of a hexagonal wrench,fasteners,a set of instructions,and hinge covers.
iii.procedural history 
in its initial scope ruling,commerce found the trim kits subject to the orders.commerce found that the trim kits are aluminum extrusions which are shapes and forms made of an aluminum alloy that is covered by the scope of the orders.internal quotation marks omitted.commerce also rejected meridian contention that the trim kits meet the finished goods kit exclusion.assessing the trim kits against the orders scope and prior scope rulings,commerce found that the trim kits did not meet the terms of the finished goods kit exclusion because,as the exclusion states,a kit inclusion of fasteners and other extraneous materials does not remove it from the orders scope.
meridian appealed to the cit,which then remanded commerce initial scope ruling.meridian,llc united states meridian i,wl,at.int l trade june.observing that a remand is sometimes needed if an intervening event may affect the validity of the agency action,the cit agreed with meridian argument that commerce failed to consider a prior scope ruling interpreting terms of the orders not at issue in the instant appeal.id.
subsequent litigation resulted in four more cit opinions that included two additional remands to commerce.see meridian,llc united states meridian ii,supp.int l trade remanding commerce first remand determination that the trim kits are within the scope of the orders meridian,llc united states meridian iii,supp.int l trade sustaining commerce second remand determination that the trim kits are within the scope of the orders meridian,llc united states meridian iv,supp.int l trade granting motion for reconsideration of meridian iii and remanding commerce second remand determination for reconsideration.in the third remand determination,commerce concluded that it must find that the trim kits are excluded from the orders as finished goods kits to comport with the cit interpretation of the orders scope.in so doing,commerce observed that it appears that the cit instructions resulted in a tension between the cit holding and the plain language of the scope of the orders.the cit sustained commerce third remand determination in its final opinion.see meridian v,supp.at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we apply the same standard of review as the cit when reviewing a commerce scope ruling,see shenyang yuanda aluminum indus.eng g united states,fed.cir,though we give due respect to the cit informed opinion,novosteel sa united states,fed.cir.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.under that standard,we uphold a commerce scope ruling that is supported by substantial evidence on the record and otherwise in accordance with law.b b i.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.eckstrom,united states,fed.cir.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
ii.the trim kits fall within the unambiguous terms of the orders scope 
this appeal hinges on the interpretation of the orders scope.the government alleges that the plain language of the orders demonstrates that the trim kits are within the scope of the orders.appellant br.capitalization modified.the government further
