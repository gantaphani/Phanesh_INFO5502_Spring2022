plaintiffs mir kazem kashani,manoutcher nikfarjam,and shantia hassanshahi collectively plaintiffs allege in their second amended complaint that they and defendant tsann kuen china enterprise,a chinese corporation that is the parent corporation or owner of the other named defendants collectively defendants,executed a written agreement whereby plaintiffs would establish an iranian corporation in iran to build a plant in iran for manufacturing defendants computer products to be sold in iran and elsewhere and would provide defendants with percent of the shares of the corporation.plaintiffs further allege that in reliance on this agreement they expended monies on the project,began setting up the plant,and obtained necessary cooperation from the government of iran.according to plaintiffs,defendants ceased doing business in the computer industry,in whole or in part,and decided not to proceed with the agreement.plaintiffs filed an action for breach of contract seeking their expenditures and anticipated lost profits as damages.on appeal,plaintiffs waived their right to seek recovery for their expenses.
the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on the ground that the alleged agreement is unenforceable as illegal and against public policy in that it violates united states presidential executive orders and implementing regulations,which prohibit,without a license,any united states person from engaging in any transaction,either directly or indirectly,that deals in or relates to the exportation,sale or supply of goods,technology or services to iran or the government of iran or any investment in or financing of such transactions.
in affirming the summary judgment,we hold that plaintiffs legally can not establish their claim because the agreement upon which plaintiffs claim is based is illegal and against public policy.we also hold that neither the presidential executive orders nor the regulations implementing the orders should be interpreted to preclude defendants from prevailing on their affirmative defense of illegality.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs are residents and citizens of the united states.defendants tsann kuen china enterprise,and tsann kuen shanghai enterprise,are chinese corporations doing business in china and elsewhere defendant tsann kuen usa,is a california corporation with its principal place of business in california defendant tsann kuen enterprise,is a taiwanese corporation with offices in california and elsewhere defendant eupa international is a nevada corporation with its principal place of business in california defendant tsann kuen enterprise,owns directly or indirectly the other defendant companies and the defendant companies use the names tsann kuen or eupa or variations of those names.
defendants manufactured computer products and desired to sell notebook computers in iran,but the high import duties were an impediment.the islamic republic of iran iran or government of iran established a free trade zone known as the kish free trade zone in which goods manufactured in that zone received preferential import duty treatment even if the goods utilized some components manufactured outside iran.according to plaintiffs,they and defendants agreed to establish an iranian corporation to manufacture notebook computers in the free trade zone and to sell that product in iran and in neighboring countries.the initial capital of the corporation was to be million.under the agreement,defendants would supply necessary resources,including rights for the design,manufacturing,assembling,and sale of its products arrange for equipment for the iranian facility create research and development at the facility and train plaintiffs engineers and workers to manufacture the computers at the facility.defendants were to receive percent of the stock of the corporation as long as the agreement between the parties is valid,while plaintiffs would form the corporation and establish the facility in iran.as plaintiffs were to transfer to defendants percent of stock of the corporation,at least initially,plaintiffs would necessarily have had all of the outstanding stock of the corporation and have been the controlling shareholders of that entity.plaintiffs allege that the parties reduced their agreement to writing in a november,letter of intent agreement that provided that the writing was to be binding plaintiffs personally planned to manage the company,which was to manufacture and sell the products in iran and elsewhere.it appears that the iranian government was involved in the project,for there is correspondence reporting meetings with iranian government officials.plaintiffs introduced in evidence an internal memorandum of defendants stating,s ince computers on the iranian market are now very expensive and heavily taxed,and americans are not allowed in but they want american technology,they are taking a roundabout route.
plaintiffs allege that in reliance on the agreement,they invested time and money to carry out their obligations,including creating an iranian corporation known as notebook international plaintiffs contend that they did not,and were not going to,supply or sell from the united states any computer or software materials or technology.initially,plaintiffs operated notebook international out of california,and they began to arrange for financing either from a pakistani investor or an iranian bank,but defendants decided to pull out of the computer industry entirely or in relevant part and decided not to proceed with the november,sic contract.defendant tsann kuen china shanghai enterprise,conceded it ceased manufacturing computers in.thus,according to plaintiffs,defendants breached the agreement by terminating it without cause,thereby causing plaintiffs damages in the amounts plaintiffs expended and lost profits.
plaintiffs asserted only a cause of action for breach of the agreement and not one for quantum meruit.defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that the agreement was illegal and contrary to public policy because it violated executive orders,federal register,executive order and executive order and,federal register may,orders and the implementing iranian transactions regulations regulations those orders and regulations prohibit any united states person from engaging in any transaction,directly or indirectly,relating to the exportation,reexportation,sale,or supply of goods,technology,or services to iran or the government of iran.the orders were authorized by,inter alia,the international emergency economic powers act et.ieepa,which act provides for civil and criminal penalties for violations of orders promulgated pursuant to that statute.
defendants contend that california law renders the agreement unenforceable because the agreement has an illegal object and is contrary to law.plaintiffs counter that the agreement was legal where executed and where it was to be performed and was capable of being performed in a legal manner that defendants did not meet their burden to show that a license could not have been obtained from the united states office of foreign asset control ofac authorizing even retroactively the agreement that the orders are not intended to confer a private benefit or right of action or defense on a party and that to the extent the orders might cover the transaction involved,they are unconstitutionally vague.
the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and entered judgment.plaintiffs appealed.

summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
a defendant moving for summary judgment meets its burden of showing that there is no merit to a cause of action if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.p.once the defendant has made such a showing,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or as to a defense to the cause of action.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.if the plaintiff does not make such a showing,summary judgment in favor of the defendant is appropriate.to obtain a summary judgment,all that the defendant need do is to show that the plaintiff can not establish at least one element of the cause of action t he defendant need not himself conclusively negate any such element id.at,d.

iran sanctions 
for more than two decades following the iran hostage crisis in the united states has promulgated various trade sanctions against iran.on november,president carter issued the first of a series of orders declaring a national emergency and freezing all iranian assets subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.exec.order.although modified in scope,the iranian assets control regulations remain in effect.in imposing the freeze,the president exercised powers authorized under the ieepa and the national emergencies act.thereafter,unilateral trade sanctions were imposed against iran.specifically,on april,with certain limited exceptions,the export of goods to iran was prohibited,and on april,the united states prohibited all imports from iran,travel by united states citizens to iran,and payments or transfers of credit,funds,property or interests therein to persons in iran.exec.order,exec.order.the department of the treasury through ofac issued regulations implementing the embargo imposed by executive order.iranian assets control,pt.as part of the algiers accord that ended the hostage crisis,the frozen assets were returned to iran and certain sanctions against iran were revoked.exec.orders,see also exec.order.thereafter,with a few exceptions,until the imposition of certain transaction sanctions in exec.order,ofac did not administer restrictions on dealing or trading with iran.there were other export control regulations that had applied to iran since,administered under other statutes.see generally newcomb,office of foreign assets control,practising law inst.commercial law and prac.course handbook series.in,the secretary of state placed iran on the list of countries,where it has remained since that time d dammarell islamic republic of iran d,peterson islamic republic of iran d,fn.
on march,president clinton announced that the actions and policies of the government of iran constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,foreign policy,and economy of the united states exec.order.invoking the authority of the ieepa,the president declared a national emergency to deal with that threat and banned transactions involving iranian petroleum resources.two months later,the president issued executive order,federal register may,which bans,among other things,most importation,exportation,and reexportation of goods between the united states and iran.
one court has described executive order as follows the order is clothed with the most serious of purposes,and it is couched in the broadest of terms.it prohibits,with only limited exceptions,the exportation of any goods,technology,or services,the reexportation of any goods or technology,the entering into any transaction by a united states person relating to goods or services of iranian origin,and any new investment by a united states person in iran.citation.moreover,it bars any transaction that evades or avoids its restrictions.citation.the obvious purpose of the order is to isolate iran from trade with the united states.consistent with the plain meaning of the term export,the executive order intended to cut off the shipment of goods intended for iran see message to congress on iran,weekly comp.doc.united states ehsan cir,see also of state dispatch may,wl secretary of state warren christopher states executive order will ban all trade and investment with iran transfair,united states.

to implement these orders,ofac promulgated the iranian transactions regulations pt.the regulations,which were in effect at the time of the transaction at issue and which track the orders,prohibit,inter alia,the following the exportation,reexportation,sale,or supply,directly or indirectly,from the united states,or by a united states person deemed to be any united states citizen,permanent resident alien,entity organized under the laws of the united states including foreign branches,or any person in the united states,wherever located,of any goods,technology,or services to iran or the government of iran any united states person,wherever located,engag ing in any transaction or dealing transaction or dealing includes but is not limited to purchasing,selling,transporting,swapping,brokering,approving,financing,facilitating,or guaranteeing b in or related to goods,technology,or services for exportation,reexportation,sale or supply,directly or indirectly,to iran or the government of iran a new investment constitutes a a commitment or contribution of funds or other assets or b a loan or other extension of credit,as defined in by a united states person in iran or in property including entities owned or controlled by the government of iran.
the regulations state that no united states person,wherever located,may approve,finance,facilitate,or guarantee any transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by this part if performed by a united states person or within the united states.a prohibited facilitation or approval of a transaction by a foreign person is defined to include,among other activities,referral to a foreign person purchase orders,requests for bids,or similar business opportunities involving iran or the government of iran to which the united states person could not directly respond as a result of the prohibitions contained in this part.b.the regulations further provide the prohibition on the exportation,reexportation,sale or supply of services contained in applies to services performed on behalf of a person in iran or the government of iran or where the benefit of such services is otherwise received in iran a.a united states person may not act as broker for the provision of goods,services or technology,from whatever source,to or from iran or the government of iran act as a broker for the provision of financing,a financial guarantee or an extension of credit to any person specifically to enable that person to construct or operate a facility in iran or owned or controlled by the government of iran or act as a broker for the provision of financing,a financial guarantee,or an extension of credit to any person specifically to enable that person to provide goods,services,or technology intended for iran or the government of iran.b.
as noted above,violations of the regulations are subject to civil and criminal penalties.title united states code section,enacted in,makes it a crime for a united states person to engage in financial transactions with governments of countries designated as supporting international terrorism,and iran has been designated as one of those countries also,under the iran and libya sanctions act of,stat.the president may sanction domestic and foreign companies investing in or trading with iran.see also no united states assistance for exports to iran.

a specific license is a document issued by ofac,upon application,authorizing a particular transaction to a particular person or entity.b.there is no formal process of appeal from a denial of a license application.many of ofac licensing determinations are guided by foreign and national security concerns.numerous issues often must be coordinated with the department of state and other government agencies,such as the department of commerce.ofac frequently asked questions,supra.
the parties agreement violates the law 
the agreement at issue is prohibited by the orders and regulations,as is the performance promised and rendered by plaintiffs.plaintiffs are united states citizens who reside in california,and they are therefore united states person s as defined by the orders.exec.order,c.the express purposes of the agreement were to supply goods,technology,and services to iran and even to sell products to the government of iran.these purposes violate the orders and regulations.exec.order,a,d.plaintiffs do not contend that they had obtained authorization for their activities pursuant to any specific license.
by entering into the contract,plaintiffs approve d and facilitate d a prohibited transaction,acts barred by the regulations.that the agreement was signed in china or called for performance in iran does not avoid the clear prohibitions of the orders and regulations.similarly,that the agreement does not specify the source of funding is likewise irrelevant.the agreement specifically states that plaintiffs are to be involved in the manufacture of products in iran and have a majority of the shares of the iranian corporation that plaintiffs are establishing to engage in the manufacture and sale of computer products in iran.
plaintiffs actual and anticipated performance under the agreement were likewise prohibited.plaintiffs allege that they traveled to iran to begin setting up the plant and secured the necessary governmental cooperation.plaintiffs further allege that pursuant to the agreement they invested considerable funds,time and resources into the project to find the land,plan the facility,and other expensive preparations and make certain commitments,including with the government of iran these activities,done in furtherance of the agreement to supply goods,technology and services to iran,were all prohibited.exec.order,a i,e b transaction or dealing includes facilitating.the agreement and plaintiffs performance of that agreement are in clear violation of the orders and regulations and therefore of the implementing statute.et.
availability of license and legal performance 
relying upon the general rule that a contract must be construed so as to give it a legal effect if possible under the circumstances,a contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful,operative,definite,reasonable,and capable of being carried into effect,if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties,an interpretation which gives effect is preferred to one which makes void,plaintiffs contend that the availability of a specific license to avoid the prohibitions of the orders and regulations precludes refusing to enforce the agreement on the ground of illegality.plaintiffs also point to the language in the regulations that states that the prohibitions apply e xcept as otherwise authorized pursuant to this part,and to the licensing provisions in subpart e,which provide that n o license or other authorization contained in this part,or otherwise issued by or under the direction of the director of the office of foreign assets control,authorizes or validates any transaction effected prior to the issuance of the license,unless specifically provided in such license or other authorization.a,italics added.plaintiffs contend that these provisions make it possible for them to obtain a specific license that would not only validate the obligations of the agreement but also grant retroactive authorization for the agreement itself and the performance rendered under the agreement.
it is true that a s a general rule,if a contract can be performed legally,a court will presume that the parties intended a lawful mode of performance.redke silvertrust cal d,see west covina enterprises,chalmers cal d.as one court has noted,many contracts can not lawfully be performed without securing a permit,license,or approval from some governmental officer or board,and yet the contracts are not deemed illegal.nussenbaum chambers chambers,quoted in williston on contracts ed.citing this massachusetts case,the california supreme court stated,t he requirement of government approval for performance of a contract does not invalidate a lawful contract.citation.alpha beta food markets retail clerks cal d,wage control laws intended to curb inflation,while in effect,did not require wage board approval to validate parties collective bargaining agreement when payments under agreement lawfully could be made without such approval after wage controls were terminated see witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,contracts,lewis queen ball sons,supra,cal d at.
there are many different types of legally required licenses,certificates,registrations,and other governmental approvals necessary for engaging in business and professional activities.these provisions vary as to their purposes and sanctions.agreements between parties may expressly or impliedly be conditioned upon obtaining government approval or require one party to obtain government approval as part of its performance under the contract.the fact that a party agrees to do an act which will be illegal unless governmental permission is obtained does not make such an agreement illegal,and a party that does not obtain such permission may be held responsible in damages for his failure to perform the agreement.williston on contracts,supra.
there are,however,various situations in which the failure to obtain governmental approval renders a contract illegal and unenforceable in conformity with the general rule that a court will not enforce an illegal contract or provide for compensation for an illegal act.lewis queen ball sons,supra,cal d at.for example in lawn camino heights,d.lawn,the court said s ince no permit had been obtained from the commissioner of corporations at the time the agreement for such payment was made,defendant corporation promise to compensate plaintiff in that manner was illegal and unenforceable even though the parties may have intended to obtain a permit before the stock was issued.in that case,the statute expressly prohibited contracting without obtaining the permit.
the restatement second of contracts provides in section if a party is prohibited from doing an act because of his failure to comply with a licensing,registration or similar requirement,a promise in consideration of his doing that act or of his promise to do it is unenforceable on grounds of public policy if a the requirement has a regulatory purpose,and b the interest in the enforcement of the promise is clearly outweighed by the public policy behind the requirement.according to corbin,c ourts often analyze the enforceability of a contract in this manner.corbin,supra.modern courts balance the regulatory interest behind the licensing statute against the interest in enforcing the contract.see waisbren peppercorn productions,th,d.
the orders and regulations here are regulating in nature and involve national security.see united states ehsan,supra,at.no one could seriously contend that enforcement of the agreement in question is not outweighed by the public policy behind the governmental provisions.see tentative draft,supra,com.c,pp.significant negative consequences for deterrence will justify the court in denying relief,even in the face of substantial unjust enrichment.
moreover,the applicable provisions are comparable to the requirement in lawn,supra,d,that a license be obtained before contracting.the context of the regulations as a whole and the stated purpose and intent of the orders and regulations are that issuance of a specific license is a prerequisite to engaging in any prohibited transaction,including entering into a contract concerning a prohibited transaction.the licensing provisions of the regulations state transactions subject to the prohibitions contained in this chapter,or to prohibitions the implementation and administration of which have been delegated to the director of the office of foreign assets control,which are not authorized by general license may be effected only under specific licenses.b,italics added.thus,transactions that are not authorized by a general license can not be operative legally absent the issuance of a specific license.inter valley health plan blue shield th,d in determining intent of lawmakers,a court looks first to words of provision,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning,and administrative regulations are subject to the same rules.entry into and performance of the contract at issue here were not authorized by any general license and could be fulfilled legally only by obtaining a specific license,which was not done.
unlike many licensing provisions,granting a specific license under the regulations is not based on meeting certain specified qualifications or requirements.as noted above,the licensing determinations are guided by foreign and national security concerns.ofac frequently asked questions,supra.to proceed with a prohibited transaction without a license necessarily risks conflicting with foreign and national security concerns.
that a license may be obtained after the agreement was entered into and that it is theoretically possible that the transaction effected prior to the issuance of the license can be validated a,may be factors in balanc ing the regulatory interest behind the licensing statute against the interest in enforcing the contract.corbin,supra,see rest d contracts,transfair,united states,supra.at.in this case,the regulatory interests far outweigh any interest in enforcing the agreement.once the technology and product are provided to those in iran,the anticipated harm intended to be prevented has occurred.that a license might theoretically be obtained thereafter can not undo that harm.moreover,there is no evidence that the parties contemplated obtaining a license.the agreement does not impose this requirement,and there is no evidence that plaintiffs ever applied for a license.
plaintiffs rely upon gardiner burket d,a case that is distinguishable.gardiner involved an oral contract to remove a building,which was done without a necessary permit.the court did not invalidate the contract because a permit could have been obtained.here,unlike the oral agreement in gardiner,the written contract was itself illegal.
plaintiffs assert that the burden rests upon defendants to show that plaintiffs could not obtain a license.but with no license,the contract and performance under the contract are illegal.indeed,there have been successful criminal prosecutions for violations of the regulations,notwithstanding theoretical availability of a license that might retroactively authorize a prohibited act.see,united states ehsan,supra,at united states hescorp,heavy equipment sales cir.it is plaintiffs burden to show not only that the transaction is licensed but that any license obtained after the transaction was effected cured the illegal activity that has occurred.we need not determine the effect of a showing that one could obtain a license that would validate prospectively and retroactively the transaction because plaintiffs have not made such a showing here.plaintiffs submission suggesting that others may have obtained licenses for transactions in iran is not persuasive because even if one could draw an inference from past licenses granted that a license would be granted in a specific case,the examples given do not involve transactions comparable to that in the instant case,and there is no indication of when those alleged licenses were given or the circumstances existing at the time of the alleged licenses.
there is another reason that plaintiffs can not avail themselves of the general principle that if a contract can be performed in a legal manner it is not void.this principle does not apply where the one seeking to enforce the contract participates in the illegal performance.platt wells fargo bank d.plaintiffs illegal performance precludes them from relying on the possibility of a license to validate their illegal conduct.
effect of no creation of right or benefit provision 
plaintiffs contend that provisions in the orders that state that n othing contained in this order shall create any right or benefit,substantive or procedural,enforceable by any party against the united states,its agencies or instrumentalities,its officers or employees,or any other person exec.order,exec.order,preclude defendants from relying on the orders as the basis for the affirmative defense of illegality.that language,or similar language,has appeared in many relatively recent presidential orders.see,exec.order.june,this order is intended only to improve the internal management of the federal government,and is not intended to create any right or benefit,substantive or procedural,enforceable at law by a party against the united states,its agencies,its officers,or any person exec.order,this order is not intended,and should not be construed,to create any right or benefit,substantive or procedural,enforceable at law by a party against the united states,its agencies,its officers,or its employees exec.order,this order shall not be interpreted to create any right or benefit,substantive or procedural,enforceable at law by a party against the united states,its agencies,its officers,its agents,or any person.
there is no specific indication in these orders of why that language is included.an obvious goal was to ensure that nothing in the orders would provide a potential claim against the united states or its officers.in the instances when the phrase or any other person was added,it would appear that the intent was to preclude any implied cause of action,even though congress and the president must show an intent to create such a cause of action for there to be one 
nevertheless,it appears that the president,in his orders,took the precaution to preclude the possibility that anyone could construe the orders as creating any possible right of action or benefit.there is no indication,however,that by doing so,the president sought to supersede other laws or displace state law.see betancourt storke housing investors cal th,d,no federal preemption of traditional state regulation unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.
to conclude that the president intended to preclude any civil consequence of the orders would lead to and absurd results.for example,to read the orders to preclude any right or benefit that arose from any other law would mean that a party could not rely upon the orders for purposes of invoking such traditional contract principles as impossibility,impracticality,frustration,force majeure,and unclean hands.see,queens office tower associates iran air tribunal reports iran asset regulation provides frustration or impossibility defense.under plaintiffs theory,the orders could not even be used for purposes of interpreting a,in determining that a contract could be performed legally,as argued by plaintiffs.
the only logical reading of the provisions in the orders concerning rights or benefits is that the orders themselves can not form the basis of a claim or defense.here,defendants rely on state law principles of illegality that illegality is based on a violation of the orders and regulations.it is not the orders or regulations that provide the affirmative defense.it is state law.
the cases cited by plaintiffs in support of their interpretation are distinguishable.in centola,supra,d at page,the plaintiff asserted a private cause of action directly under executive orders and,which orders provide that it is the policy of the government of the united states to prohibit discrimination in employment and that the policy is applicable to the united states postal service.italics added.section of executive order,states,t his executive order does not confer any right or benefit enforceable in law or equity against the united states or its representatives.id.at the court held that by themselves,these executive orders do not create a judicially enforceable private right of action for centola.id.at,italics added.here,defendants affirmative defense does not arise directly under the orders and does not invoke the orders by themselves.instead,the affirmative defense is one of illegality under state law,which illegality is,in turn,based on a violation of the orders.
in brug national coalition for homeless d,the court held that there was no private right of action under executive order antidiscrimination provision because it does not provide for one.again,here defendants do not assert a defense based on the order itself.in resolution trust scaletty,a defendant in a case brought by the resolution trust corporation rtc asserted as an affirmative defense the violation by the rtc of an executive order requiring federal agencies in litigation to attempt to achieve compromise and settlement prior to filing suit.that regulation stated that its provisions should not be construed to create a defense on the part of any party.thus,a party could not preclude a claim against it by asserting that a government agency had failed to attempt to achieve a compromise first.here,the defense is not that there was a violation of any purported prerequisite imposed by an order for filing a suit.rather,the affirmative defense is based on the effect under state law of a violation of an order.
the inapplicability of arbitration cases 
plaintiffs rely on the unpublished case of mgm productions group,aeroflot russian airlines may,wl mgm as support for their position that the orders and regulations did not make the transaction unenforceable here.that case is distinguishable.
in mgm,supra,wl,petitioner assignor,a united states citizen,rendered consulting services to the russian airline company,aeroflot,in connection with leasing aircraft equipment to iran iranian governmental entity.aeroflot refused to pay for the services and,pursuant to the agreement with petitioner assignor,commenced an arbitration in stockholm,sweden under the laws of the state of new york and russia.aeroflot argued,inter alia,that it need not pay anything because the contract was illegal under the same orders and regulations at issue in the instant case.the arbitration panel held that the transaction did not violate the orders or regulations.plaintiff successfully sought to confirm the award in a united states district court pursuant to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of june,title united states code section et the new york convention.the court agreed with the arbitral panel that the agreement did not violate the orders or regulations.the arbitral panel had concluded that the services in question were to aeroflot and not to any entity in iran the court said that even if the agreement did violate the orders and regulations,that would not be grounds under the new york convention for a refusing to confirm an award because the public policy defense under the new york convention to enforcement of an arbitral award applies only where enforcement would violate the forum state most basic notions of morality and justice.mgm,supra,wl.
the court,in effect,distinguished between public policy as contemplated by article of the new york convention as a ground not to enforce a foreign arbitral award and national public policy that might cause a domestic court to consider a contract illegal.there is an important distinction between domestic and international public policy according to this distinction what is considered to pertain to public policy in domestic relations does not necessarily pertain to public policy in international relations considering the legislative history of article v b,the new york convention can be said to refer to international public policy as distinct from domestic public policy.van den berg,the new york arbitration convention of see parsons wh.ov,societe de du cir,requiring supranational emphasis rather than reliance on national political interests.even if courts do not distinguish between international public interest and domestic public interest,courts have adopted very narrow views of article v b new york convention public policy exception.born,international commercial arbitration ed see fotochrome,copal company,limited cir,the public policy limitation on the convention is to be construed narrowly to be applied only where enforcement would violate the forum state most basic notions of morality and justice.accordingly,arbitration enforcement cases arising under the new york convention are not determinative of judicial treatment of contracts that violate law.
orders and regulations not unconstitutionally vague 
plaintiffs argument that the prohibition of facilitation or evasion specified in the orders and regulations renders those orders and regulations unconstitutionally vague is not supported by applicable case law.plaintiffs cite the unpublished case of looper morgan of treasury wl,dist.lexis.june,looper that said that a provision in a presidential order barring evasion of the prohibition of transactions with libya was too vague.in that case,the court ruled that ofac could not defeat the privilege and review papers of an attorney returning to the united states whose clients were suspected of doing business on behalf of the sanctioned libyan government.the court held that the activities were not covered by the applicable regulations.see lehrer,unbalancing the terrorists checkbook analysis of policy in its economic war on international terrorism tul.internat.comp,discussing looper case but noting judicial deference toward ofac regulations and licensing procedure,and referring to looper as one of the few critical opinions of ofac at,fn.marcuss,grist for the litigation mill in economic sanctions programs law policy internat.bus,discussing looper case.here plaintiffs activities are clearly covered by the applicable regulations.
moreover,courts have upheld the validity of the use of such statutory words as facilitate against contentions that the words are unconstitutionally vague.see,united states two tracts of real property cir,use or facilitation language as interpreted held not unconstitutionally vague turf center,united states cir,the words facilitate and involving not unconstitutionally vague united states smith,the words promote,manage,establish,carry on or facilitate the promotion,management,establishment or carrying on are words which have a general meaning,and no serious argument can be presented by which it may be successfully contended that these words are either vague or ambiguous or have some obscure meaning see also united states hescorp,heavy equipment sales,supra,at,in connection with the term service contract,the executive order and the regulations gave hescorp fair notice that its intended shipments to iran were prohibited so as not to be unconstitutionally vague.thus,the language to which plaintiffs object do not cause the orders and regulations to be unconstitutional.
no other grounds for enforceability 
although the courts generally will not enforce an illegal contract,in some cases the statute making the conduct illegal,in providing for a fine or administrative discipline,excludes by implication the additional penalty involved in holding the illegal contract unenforceable citation.sometimes the forfeiture resulting from unenforceability is disproportionately harsh considering the nature of the illegality.in each such case,how the aims of policy can best be achieved depends on the kinds of illegality and the particular facts involved.citation.gensler,supra,cal d at.even if a determination of enforceability of patently illegal contracts can be based on the particular facts,plaintiffs have not established any basis for departing from the practice of courts generally not to enforce a contract in violation of law.asdourian araj,supra,cal d at,see waisbren peppercorn productions,supra,th at,d,quoting severance cal d.
an agreement in violation of trade restrictions promulgated for national security reasons and therefore for the purposes of protecting the public should be unenforceable.the penalty is not disproportionate to the severity of the offense,and any forfeiture is not unfair.plaintiffs now only seek lost restitution of monies or consideration paid to defendants.there is no allegation that any benefit was conferred on or retained by defendants,that defendants have been unjustly enriched,or that any joint venture between plaintiffs and defendants retains monies that could be disbursed to the joint venturers moreover,plaintiffs knew they were dealing with iran and even provided for the possibility of the agreement not being valid 
effective deterrence of violations of the regulations will result from the refusal to enforce the from enforcing the plaintiffs claim.defendants are no more at fault in entering into the transaction than plaintiffs.defendants breach of the agreement prior to full performance befo
