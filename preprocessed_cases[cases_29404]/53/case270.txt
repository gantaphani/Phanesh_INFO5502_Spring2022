the appellant,which we refer to as ppc,challenges a determination by the international trade commission that ppc failed to prove that the importation of certain coaxial cable connectors violated section of the tariff act of.the commission ruled that ppc failed to satisfy one of the elements of a violation of section the domestic industry requirement.we affirm.
ppc manufactures cable connectors that are used to connect coaxial cables to electronic devices,such as cable television receivers.ppc filed a complaint with the commission asserting that the importation,sale for importation,and sale after importation of certain coaxial cable connectors infringed four of ppc patents and therefore violated section.of the four ppc patents,two are design patents and two are utility patents.this case involves one of the design patents,patent no.the design patent.that patent issued in and describes an ornamental design for a coaxial cable connector.the design patent is a continuation of patent application the application.one of the two utility patents,patent the utility patent,is also a continuation of the application.
section makes unlawful the importation of articles that infringe a valid and enforceable united states patent,but only if a domestic industry relating to the articles protected by the patent exists or is in the process of being established.a.the complainant can satisfy the domestic industry requirement in one of three ways prescribed by a,which provides 
a n industry in the united states shall be considered to exist if there is in the united states,with respect to the articles protected by the patent,copyright,trademark,mask work,or design concerned 
a significant investment in plant and equipment 
b significant employment of labor or capital or 
c substantial investment in its exploitation,including engineering,research and development,or licensing.
in contending that it established the existence of a domestic industry relating to the design patent,ppc relies on subparagraph c.the issue in this case is whether expenses ppc incurred in asserting and defending the validity of that patent constituted a substantial investment in exploitation of the design patent through licensing.
ppc has granted only one license for the design patent.that license was executed in early between ppc and arris international,formerly antec corporation,at the conclusion of years of litigation involving the two parties and arris distributor,international communications manufacturing,icm.ppc contends that money it spent during the years of litigation leading up to the execution of the license should be treated as an investment in licensing.
in presenting that argument,ppc relies principally on a lawsuit alleging infringement of the design patent that ppc brought against arris in the middle district of florida the florida action.in,a jury found the design patent valid and infringed,and it awarded ppc million in damages.the court granted ppc request for injunctive relief.also in,ppc sued icm in the district of colorado,again alleging infringement of the design patent the colorado action.finally,in,ppc sued arris in the western district of wisconsin,asserting only the utility patent the wisconsin action.a jury in that case found the utility patent valid and infringed.in,following judgment in the florida and wisconsin actions,and before the colorado action went to judgment,the parties entered into a settlement that included a license agreement.the agreement permitted arris to practice all the patents that claim priority to the application,one of which is the design patent.
based on the evidence of ppc expenditures in that series of lawsuits,an international trade commission administrative law judge found that ppc had satisfied the domestic industry requirement by establishing a substantial investment in the exploitation of the design patent by licensing.the administrative law judge ruled that at least some part of the legal expenses that ppc had incurred in enforcing the design patent in the florida action should be treated as an investment in licensing,because a portion of ppc expenses were likely directed to settlement and licensing negotiations.the administrative law judge did not address the colorado or the wisconsin lawsuits.he also rejected ppc argument that it had made a substantial investment in research and development related to the ex connector,a cable connector that ppc manufactures and distributes.as to that issue,the administrative law judge ruled that ppc had abandoned that argument and that,in any event,the argument was without merit because the ex connector was not covered by the design claimed in the design patent.
the commission reviewed the initial determination and reversed the administrative law judge ruling that ppc had established a domestic market.the commission noted that the term licensing in section a c encompasses not only licenses that are intended to spur production of the patented article in the first instance,but also licenses that are issued after litigation and capture royalties from existing production.the commission acknowledged that in some circumstances litigation expenses may support a finding that a domestic licensing industry exists.in this case,however,the commission found that ppc had not met its burden to show that its litigation expenses relating to the design patent were related to licensing.
the commission ruled that to permit litigation costs not shown to be to satisfy the domestic industry requirement would effectively render the domestic industry requirement a nullity for patentees who choose to enforce their patent rights in the district courts.the consequence of so doing,the commission stated,would be to dilute the commission role as a forum for resolving trade disputes.
the commission explained that in a case such as this one,deciding whether particular litigation expenses were related to licensing and whether those expenditures were substantial is a inquiry that depends on factors such as the nature of the industry and the size of the complaining party.that inquiry would also require the to determine whether the incurred expenses serve to encourage practical applications of the invention or bring the patented technology to the market.the commission remanded the case to give ppc an opportunity to show what portions of its enforcementrelated expenses were related to licensing and to demonstrate that its investment in licensing was substantial.
on remand,the administrative law judge ruled that ppc had not sufficiently tied its litigation costs to licensing and that any investment that ppc had made in licensing was not substantial.while acknowledging that the issue was a close one,the administrative law judge based his ruling on findings that ppc had received only one license,of which only a part related to the design patent,that ppc had no established licensing program,and that it had made no other efforts to procure licenses for the design patent.the commission adopted the administrative law judge remand opinion without modification,and that order became final.
before turning to the merits of ppc legal argument,we address the commission argument that ppc does not have standing to appeal.the commission argues that because the only imported product that was found to infringe the design patent,the fei yu model connector,was also found to infringe the utility patent,ppc has suffered no injury from the commission decision and therefore lacks standing to appeal.
the commission relies on our opinion in yingbinnature guangdong wood industry international trade commission,in which we held certain claims on appeal to be moot.in yingbin,the commission found that the respondent had imported a flooring product that infringed two groups of claims in the complainant patents,the snap action claims and the lower lip claims,each of which related to the joint between adjacent planks.finding all other statutory requirements satisfied,the commission entered a general exclusion order with respect to both groups of claims.the respondent appealed as to the lower lip claims,but not as to the snap action claims.we noted that because both groups of claims expired on the same day,the respondent would be in the same position regardless of how we ruled on the lower lip claims,so we held that the appeal as to those claims was moot.the respondent real concern,we explained,was that the finding of infringement as to the lower lip claims might interfere with the respondent subsequent efforts to redesign its product to avoid infringement.we held those concerns about the possible future effects of the commission ruling as to the lower lip claims to be too hypothetical to confer standing on the respondent to press an appeal that would have no immediate practical effect.
ppc is in a different position.it is true that the only product that the commission found to infringe the design patent was also found to infringe the utility patent.but ppc concerns are not related to possible future effects of the commission decision,as was the case for the appellant in yingbin.ppc has sought a general exclusion order relating to the design patent.the fact that a particular model of connectors the fei ye model connectors will be excluded regardless of the outcome of this appeal does not moot ppc interest in obtaining the much broader relief that would be provided by a general exclusion order,which would cover all products deemed to infringe the design patent.a favorable judicial decision could therefore significantly enhance ppc legal rights with respect to imported connectors 
the question whether a complainant has satisfied the domestic industry requirement typically presents issues of both law and fact,but ppc appeal raises only factual issues relating to the link between various litigation expenditures and licensing.in reviewing the commission factual findings as to whether particular expenses were related to licensing and whether those expenses,when viewed in the aggregate,were substantial,we apply the substantial evidence test.see finnigan int l trade comm n,akzo int l trade comm n,holding that the former requirement to prove an injury to the domestic industry,which was wed ded to the particular facts of each case and was precisely the type of question which congress has committed to the expertise of the commission,was subject to substantial evidence review.
the domestic industry requirement appears in the original tariff act of.the original act,however,did not describe how a complainant could go about establishing the existence of a domestic industry.the original act also required the complainant to show that the unfair method of competition at issue caused injury to the domestic industry and that the industry was efficiently run.in,congress disposed of the last two requirements and added what is now a,which provides three different ways that a complainant can satisfy the domestic industry requirement.omnibus trade and competitiveness act of,stat.
the reports accompanying both the house and senate versions of the amendment state that the first two ways of showing the existence of a domestic showing a significant investment in manufacturing facilities or a significant employment of labor or already being considered by the commission,at,at.but congress,believing the commission application of the domestic industry requirement had been too rigid,liberalized the domestic industry requirement by allowing that requirement to be satisfied by proof of nonmanufacturing activity,such as licensing and research,at.nonetheless,it is clear that congress had no intention of disposing of the domestic industry requirement altogether congress recognized that the commission is fundamentally a trade forum,not an intellectual property forum,and that only those intellectual property owners who are actively engaged in steps leading to the exploitation of the intellectual property should have access to the commission.id.the purpose of the commission is to adjudicate trade disputes between industries and those who seek to import goods from abroad.retention of the requirement that the statute be utilized on behalf of an industry in the united states retains that essential nexus.
the statute does not specify whether litigation expenses incurred in enforcing a patent may later be used as evidence that the required domestic industry requirement exists.in light of the purpose underlying the amendment to section,the commission reasonably concluded that expenses associated with ordinary patent litigation should not automatically be considered a substantial investment in licensing,even if the lawsuit happens to culminate in a license.to support its conclusion,the commission pointed out that a llowing patent infringement litigation activities alone to constitute a domestic industry would place the bar for establishing a domestic industry so low as to effectively render it meaningless.
we agree with the commission that expenditures on patent litigation do not automatically constitute evidence of the existence of an industry in the united states established by substantial investment in the exploitation of a patent.we therefore disagree with the dissent per se rule that patent infringement litigation is an investment in the exploitation of a patent within the meaning of section a c.indeed,even ppc does not challenge the requirement that it demonstrate a nexus between its litigation expenses and licensing.instead,ppc contends that,based on its showing before the administrative law judge,it satisfied that requirement.the administrative law judge,however,disagreed and found that ppc failed to show that its litigation expenses reflected a significant investment in licensing.with respect to the florida action,the administrative judge noted that there was no evidence that ppc had offered to license the patent to arris before commencing litigation,no evidence that ppc had sent a cease and desist letter mentioning the possibility of a settlement,and no evidence that ppc had conducted either settlement or licensing negotiations during the lawsuit itself.
ppc argues that the administrative law judge erred in finding that it had not engaged in licensing efforts.in support of that contention,however,ppc merely points to vague testimony by one of its executives to the effect that ppc made efforts to settle the case.that evidence does not undermine the administrative law judge finding that ppc failed to show that it sought to license the design patent to arris before commencing the florida action and thus that it failed to show that the litigation expenses in that case were related to licensing.the administrative law judge was likewise entitled to disregard the statement by ppc witness that members of the industry are generally reluctant to accept a license to a design patent and that ppc therefore viewed litigation as a necessary precursor to licensing the design patent.regardless of the state of mind of competitors in the connector industry,which may have made prelitigation licensing more difficult,the question before the administrative law judge was whether ppc made a substantial investment in licensing,and the administrative judge reasonably concluded that ppc failed to show that it did.
ppc sought and received a permanent injunction in the florida case,and that injunction remained in place for nearly two years until ppc licensed the design patent to arris in.as the commission recognized,that delay suggests that ppc purpose in litigating was not to obtain a license but,rather,was to stop arris from manufacturing infringing connectors.the fact that litigation adversaries eventually enter into a license agreement does not,as ppc suggests,mean that all of the prior litigation expenses must be attributed to the licensing effort.contrary to ppc suggestion,the commission did not rule that a request for or receipt of injunctive relief will always bar a patentee from later seeking to establish the existence of a domestic industry through an investment in licensing.it merely ruled that the form of relief requested is one factor that could be considered.
the administrative law judge was entitled to conclude that the florida action expenses should not be credited as expenses related to licensing.the record evidence on prelitigation communication regarding licensing is thin at best ppc sought an injunction and allowed that injunction to remain in place for nearly two years,and it was not until after the wisconsin action,which involved a different patent,that ppc granted a license to arris.for similar reasons,the administrative law judge concluded that ppc had not shown that the expenses it incurred during the colorado action were directed to licensing the patent,and for similar reasons,we will not disturb that finding.
the wisconsin action is fundamentally different from either the colorado action or the florida action because it involved only the utility patent.the administrative law judge ruled that in ppc situation,expenses associated with the enforcement of a different patent should not be credited as an investment in licensing the design patent.ppc argues that the wisconsin jury verdict was necessary to force arris to sign a license and that the administrative law judge should have credited more of ppc expenses in that lawsuit toward its investment in licensing the design patent.we disagree.although the license agreement was executed after the verdict in the wisconsin case,it does not follow that ppc actions in the wisconsin case were directed toward licensing the design patent.in any event,the administrative law judge did not disregard the expenses of the wisconsin litigation.he explained that once settlement and licensing negotiations began,the three actions became inextricably linked and that it made sense to consider the settlement and licensing negotiations related to all three cases in deciding whether ppc had made a substantial investment in licensing.the administrative law judge therefore examined ppc legal bills in all three cases and credited entries that had a work description related to licensing or settlement toward ppc investment in licensing.
ppc argues that on remand the administrative law judge failed to follow the commission directive that ppc litigation activities and costs,including any relevant costs associated with conducting settlement negotiations and then drafting and negotiating the license,may be related to licensing.because that directive uses permissive language,such as including and may,ppc argues that the administrative law judge could have credited other expenses that ppc generated during litigation and was not limited to those costs associated with conducting license negotiations and preparing the license.the commission directed the administrative law judge to decide which of ppc many expenses were truly related to licensing of the patent and which were not,and it suggested a flexible framework by which the administrative law judge could make that decision.in so doing,the administrative law judge reasonably relied on attorney work descriptions as he identified which expenses related to ppc litigation activities and which related to its investment in the domestic industry through licensing.
although the administrative law judge found that ppc had,in fact,incurred some legal expenses related to the negotiation and drafting of the licensing agreement and therefore had made at least some investment with respect to licensing of the design patent,he found that the investment was not substantial.he acknowledged ppc argument that the agreement was not reached until after ppc had filed several lawsuits against arris and icm on several different patents.ppc continues to press that argument on appeal and states that its expenses are sufficient to establish a significant investment in licensing.but because those cases had multiple objectives and were not all based on the design patent,the administrative law judge reasonably concluded that it would be inappropriate to treat most of the incurred legal fees as an investment in licensing of the design patent.we decline to disturb that ruling.
finally,the administrative law judge pointed out that ppc had no formal licensing program and that there was no evidence it had offered to license the patent to any party other than its litigation opponents.to be sure,there is no rule that a single license such as an exclusive license can not satisfy the domestic industry requirement based on a substantial investment in licensing.but the administrative law judge was entitled to view the absence of other licenses issued or negotiated for the design patent as one factor supporting his conclusion that ppc expenditures related to licensing were not substantial.based on the administrative law judge thorough review of the pertinent evidence,adopted in full by the commission,we conclude that the commission conclusion as to the licensing issue is supported by substantial evidence.
ppc also argues that the commission should have credited at least a portion of the salary that ppc paid to the named inventor on the design patent as an investment in engineering,research and development,together with ppc investment in the equipment and facilities that the inventor used as he developed the patented design.although the administrative law judge had credited the inventor salary as an investment in research and development in the initial decision,the commission disagreed.the commission noted that the evidence that ppc introduced as to its investment in research and development related generally to the application and the utility patent in addition to the design patent.the commission found that ppc had presented no evidence of any investment in research and development that related specifically to the design patent,nor did it offer any allocation of its investment to that patent.in the absence of any such evidence,the commission concluded that the most reasonable inference was that the resources that ppc invested in the inventor should be attributed nearly entirely to the development of the structural and functional design of the connector embodied in the utility application and the utility patent,rather than to the development of the ornamental design embodied in the design patent.accordingly,the commission concluded that any time and resources spent by ppc in researching or developing the ornamental design of the design patent were minimal and insufficient to constitute the substantial investment required by section a c.
ppc acknowledges that it had the burden of proof on that issue.it had the opportunity to identify how much of its investment in research and development related to the design protected by the design patent,as opposed to the family more generally,and it failed to do so.the dissent contention that there are no facts in the record before us sufficient to support the itc conclusion that time and resources spent by ppc in researching or developing the ornamental design of the patent are minimal ignores that the commission based its ruling on ppc failure to offer evidence sufficient to satisfy its burden of proof on that issue.there is no error in the commission conclusion that ppc failed to carry its burden,nor is there any reason to remand for further findings on that issue,as suggested by the dissent.
i join part ii of the majority opinion finding that ppc has standing to seek a general exclusion order with respect to the patent.i respectfully dissent from the remainder of the majority opinion because i believe that additional is needed to determine whether ppc research and development expenditures were a substantial investment in exploitation,and because the commission erred in its interpretation and application of a c resulting in its wholesale rejection of litigation expenses except in very limited circumstances for the purpose of meeting the domestic industry requirement in cases.
background 
john mezzalingua associates,ppc,ppc is a domestic producer of coaxial cable connectors used in the telecommunications,satellite,and cable television industries.ppc is headquartered in east syracuse,new york,where a substantial portion of its employees are located,and where a substantial portion of its research,development,and commercial production take place.innovations within its field have enabled ppc to obtain a portfolio of utility and design patents in the united states.
ppc is a successful business that has grown and expanded in recent years,but its business has been negatively impacted by significant competition from imports of a flood of products by manufacturers in china and taiwan.for a variety of reasons,the imports are sold at prices that severely undercut ppc pricing.
noah montena joined ppc syracuse facility in as a product engineer and worked to develop a new product for ppc called the ex connector.ppc invested a considerable sum of money in research and development that resulted in the ex connector product.montena work on the ex connector also resulted in both a utility invention and an ornamental design,each of which were separately patented as patent the patent or the utility patent and patent no.the patent or the design patent,with montena as the sole named inventor on each patent.the patented ornamental design was for a coaxial cable connector having the following appearance 
the record shows that ppc attempts to license patents in its portfolio were generally ignored and were taken seriously.ppc vice president testified that t here was a general feeling in the connector industry that there was a tremendous reluctance to take any licenses.there was even more skepticism of design patents,which were previously nonexistent in the connector industry,especially those that had never been tested in court.
on may,ppc sued its competitor arris international,in the middle district of florida,alleging that arris digicon connector infringed the patent.the parties engaged in settlement discussions during the pendency of the florida action,but no settlement was reached.ppc ultimately obtained a jury verdict that the patent was valid and infringed by arris,and was awarded damages and an injunction.that judgment was appealed by arris and affirmed by this court.john mezzalingua associates,antec.arris next sought to circumvent the injunction by adding labels to its digicon connectors to conceal the infringing design,and ppc filed a contempt motion,which was denied.on december,ppc also sued arris distributor,international communications manufacturing corporation icm and its owner randall holiday in the district of colorado for infringement of the patent by its f conn connectors supplied by arris.considerable sums were spent by ppc in legal fees and costs pursuing the florida and colorado infringement actions.
on july,less than two months after ppc utility patent issued,ppc sued arris in the western district of wisconsin for infringement of the patent by its digicon connectors.in december of,ppc received a jury verdict that arris digicon connectors infringed the patent,and that the infringement was willful.within a week of the jury verdict,negotiations began to settle the outstanding lawsuits.those negotiations resulted in a settlement agreement and separate license agreement which encompassed the patent,and under which arris,icm,and holliday agreed to pay money to ppc.
ppc next filed a complaint with the international trade commission itc under a c to prevent the importation of connectors that were alleged to infringe the patent,the patent,and other patents owned by ppc the itc issued its notice of investigation on may.because ppc requested a general exclusion order with respect to the patent,ppc was required to make out a prima facie case of such entitlement,which included establishing that a domestic industry existed under section.after a evidentiary hearing,the administrative law judge alj initially determined that the patent was valid and infringed by four chinese respondent companies that failed to participate in the investigation and that a section violation had occurred.certain coaxial cable connectors and components thereof and products containing same,ta,at int l trade comm october,initial determination.
the alj also found that ppc satisfied the domestic industry requirement based on ppc considerable litigation expenses incurred in asserting the patent against arris in the florida action the substantial sum of money received from arris under the ultimate settlement and license agreement with ppc,a portion of which was attributable to the patent ppc considerable research and development costs that resulted the ex connector product,whereby at least some portion of noah montena salary,plus his time,effort and use of ppc equipment and facilities,is attributable to his development of the design that became the patent.id.at.
after finding that a limited exclusion order would likely be circumvented,the alj recommended the issuance of a general exclusion order.id.at.the record shows that this recommendation was based largely on the business practices utilized by the chinese respondents,such as having overlapping locations,personnel,and operations.the alj explained that in china,the licensing system makes it very common and inexpensive for individuals or families to operate chinese companies under a number of different names.id.at.the alj observed that lack of clarity as to the precise relationship among the four respondents having demonstrated commonalities was indicative of the ease with which chinese entities could establish new companies and continue to import infringing compression connectors if barred only by a limited exclusion order.id.at.a ppc corporate representative testified that if ppc were able to identify and assert its patent rights against one such chinese importer,it would be easy for that company to circumvent patent enforcement efforts in many cases,they would just pick up the operation and move,change the name of the company,take out a new business license,and be manufacturing within a relatively short period of about two weeks.id.at.ppc counsel characterized this predicament as follows 
these respondents are defaulters that we engaged in the itc companies that did even appear,and the district courts are not too helpful for such infringers.they wo show up.they wo obey injunctions.they will appear in a different guise with a different name,with a knockoff product.
oral arg.at.
upon review of the alj initial determination the itc reversed,finding that the simultaneous investment in engineering,research,and development of ppc ex connector was not attributable to the design of the connector,but rather was directed to the underlying functionality.certain coaxial cable connectors and components thereof and products containing same,ta,at int l trade comm march,without a showing to the contrary,we find that montena salary,time,effort,and use of ppc equipment and facilities are more likely attributable to his development of the structural and functional design of the connector than to his development of the ornamental design.comm op.regarding litigation and licensing activities in general,the itc determined that 
we conclude that patent infringement litigation activities alone,patent infringement litigation activities that are not related to engineering,research and development,or licensing,do not satisfy the requirements of section a c.however,litigation activities including patent infringement lawsuits may satisfy these requirements if a complainant can prove that these activities are related to licensing and pertain to the patent at issue,and can document the associated costs.
id.at.as to ppc asserted litigation expenses and licensing activities in particular,the commission found that the record was insufficient to determine whether the required nexus had been shown and what the associated litigation costs were,and remanded to the alj for additional fact finding.id.at.
on remand the alj concluded that ppc settlement and license agreement had a sufficient nexus with the litigation,but that only the attorney time billed specifically for settlement negotiations and license agreement preparation could constitute investments in licensing under section a c.certain coaxial cable connectors and components thereof and products containing same,ta,at,int l trade comm may,remand determination.the sum of those particular legal expenditures was considerably smaller than the total litigation expenses,and would need to be further discounted to reflect the portion of the billable time that was spent on the patent as opposed to other patents or other matters.id.at.the alj found this lesser amount to be an insufficient investment in patent licensing activities to show the existence of a domestic industry,and therefore no a c violation was found.id.at.the itc declined to review the alj determinations on remand,and this appeal followed.certain coaxial cable connectors and components thereof and products containing same,ta,at int l trade comm july.
ii.discussion 
the itc final determination is reviewed in accordance with the administrative procedure act.see honeywell int l,itc.this court must set aside any findings or conclusions of the itc that are arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.the itc legal conclusions are reviewed de novo.honeywell,at.
statutory interpretation by the itc is a legal issue reviewed de novo,except to the extent deference to the itc construction of a statute it administers is required under the analysis set forth in chevron natural resources defense council,d.nsk united states.the itc interpretation must be set aside if is it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.
ppc investment in engineering,research,and development 
the itc determined that although ppc had made considerable investments in the engineering,research,and development of its ex connector,the investment was directed solely to the underlying functionality of the connector,and therefore could not support a finding of domestic industry with respect to a patented design that arose out of the very same effort.no apportionment or weight was given to ppc research and development regarding the design.see comm op.at.
the itc emphasized the following findings the design patent and the utility patent include the same drawing figures both patents were filed as continuations of a single prior application and ppc has not made any product covered by its patent.id.based on these findings,the itc concluded that montena salary,time,effort,and use of ppc equipment and facilities are more likely attributable to his development of the structural and functional design of the connector than to his development of the ornamental design.id.this conclusion was arbitrary and capricious.
first,the itc analysis regarding ppc research and development expenditures was cursory and arbitrary.the itc suggests that without a showing to the contrary,a design patent that was based on an underlying utility application having the same drawing figures renders the design a mere incidental afterthought to which no amount of investment or effort can be attributed.id.since the itc does not base its reasoning on any evidence or testimony as to the work done by the inventor of the connector and creator of the design,its determination that such a patent application filing strategy must reveal that the design was essentially valueless was speculative.this decision arbitrarily diminishes the availability of section relief with respect to design patents and undermines the value of design patents generally.design patents possess unique and valuable properties long ago recognized by the supreme court.see gorham white,wall.the law manifestly contemplates that giving certain new and original appearances to a manufactured article may enhance its salable value,may enlarge the demand for it,and may be a meritorious service to the public.design patents protect fundamentally different subject matter than that which is encompassed by a utility patent,and can be used to effectively and efficiently combat products that can be easily identified by visual inspection alone.
second,that ppc has not made and sold products covered by the patent is not a reasonable basis to entirely discount ppc research and development of the design.it is clear that montena work yielded a functional connector invention and an ornamental design for it.some portion of montena time and effort was necessarily devoted to the ornamental aspects of the connector.it was arbitrary for the itc to assume that this portion was de minimis and insubstantial because ppc did not ultimately put the design into one of its commercial products.ppc may have had good business reasons for not including the patented design in its products.the mere of the design can not justify a total disregard of the related underlying investment in research and development of it.
third,the itc should be wary of diminishing the contribution of an ornamental design particularly where,as here,the effort yields both functional and ornamental features applicable to the same underlying article.the result may be greater than the sum of its parts,and the parts may not be easily separable.see perry saidman theresa esquerra,a manifesto on industrial design protection resurrecting the design registration league,copyright soc y usa,since a good industrial design ideally inseparably blends form and function,the designer is penalized by the functionality doctrine because her design embodies functional qualities.patentable designs are by definition embodied in underlying utilitarian articles.see whoever invents any new,original,and ornamental design for an article of manufacture may obtain a patent therefore emphasis added.whether or not that underlying article embodies a separately patentable utility invention,the utility of the article itself can not be presumed to completely overshadow the investment in research and development of the article design.
the majority argues that no remand is necessary because the itc found ppc failed to meet its burden of proof on the issue of investment in research and development of the patented design.see comm op.at ppc presented no evidence of any investment in research and development related to the patent.while ppc did not affirmatively apportion out its investment as it pertained to the design patent only,ppc introduced substantial evidence showing its considerable investment in the ex connector research project as a whole,which necessarily included the work that yielded the patented design.the alj considered all the evidence and found it sufficient to show that at least some portion of montena salary,plus his time,effort,and use of ppc equipment and facilities,is attributable to his development of the design that became the patent.initial determination at.the itc rejected t his inference,and instead would have required some better or more precise allocation of investment costs to show direct attribution to the design.comm op.at.without first verifying the possibility and extent to which such an allocation can be made,there are no facts in the record before us sufficient to support the itc conclusion that time and resources spent by ppc in researching or developing the ornamental design of the patent are minimal and could not constitute a substantial investment.comm op.at.this conclusion is not a cost allocation but mere conjecture.the itc determination that ppc research and development with respect to the design patent failed to meet a substantial investment threshold was therefore arbitrary and capricious.remand is necessary to conduct further fact finding as to the extent to which ppc research and development efforts may be allocated between the functional and ornamental features created by montena.
ppc investment in exploitation 
section a c applicability to litigation expenses is an issue of first impression before the itc and before this court.the itc correctly characterized ppc asserted litigation expenses as rais ing an important issue of statutory interpretation,namely,whether litigation activities can constitute exploitation under section a c so as to support a finding of a domestic industry.comm op.at.as noted above,the itc answered that question as follows 
we conclude that patent infringement litigation activities alone,patent infringement litigation activities that are not related to engineering,research and development,or licensing,do not satisfy the requirements of section a c.however,litigation activities including patent infringement lawsuits may satisfy these requirements if a complainant can prove that these activities are related to licensing and pertain to the patent at issue,and can document the associated costs.
