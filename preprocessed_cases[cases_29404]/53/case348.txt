this case involves the tariff classification of magikstrips,a product imported into the united states by drygel,drygel.drygel appeals the decision of the united states court of international trade granting the united states the government for summary judgment that the united states bureau of customs and border protection customs correctly classified the magikstrips at a duty rate under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus,a catchall provision that provides for food preparations not elsewhere specified or included other.drygel,united states,d.int l trade.the court denied drygel for summary judgment that the magikstrips are more specifically provided for under htsus subheading,a provision that encompasses preparations for oral or dental hygiene other.id.because the court erred in denying drygel for summary judgment,we reverse.
background 
drygel magikstrips are thin,flavored strips of consumable material that dissolve when placed on the tongue.the magikstrips are manufactured in japan,and are packaged in small plastic containers for sale at retail stores.id.at.customs liquidated the imported magikstrips under subheading,a catchall provision applicable to food preparations not elsewhere specified or included other.drygel challenged that classification in the court of international trade,arguing that the magikstrips should be classified as preparations for oral or dental hygiene other under subheading.
we previously addressed the scope of subheading in united states.there,the court of international trade affirmed the determination by customs to classify imported certs powerful mints under subheading.united states,d.int l trade.the court rejected argument that the certs powerful mints were classifiable under subheading as preparations for oral or dental hygiene.in doing so,the court first determined that the term hygiene related to the preservation of health.id.at.next,relying on a food and drug administration fda monograph entitled oral health care and discomfort drugs establishment of a monograph.may,fda monograph,the court determined that only products achieving an antimicrobial effect contributed to oral health,d at.the court focused in particular on the statement in the fda monograph that b ecause oral malodor is caused mainly by anaerobes,only antimicrobial ingredients known to be effective against the causative organisms are effective in suppressing the malodor.id.quoting fda monograph at.because it was undisputed that the certs powerful mints did not contain any antimicrobial agents,the court concluded that they could not be classified under subheading.id.
on appeal,we concluded that the court of international trade interpretation of subheading was too restrictive,at.specifically,we determined that nothing in the fda monograph,or in the dictionaries consulted by the court,required the connection of hygiene with health.we also observed that the court interpretation was contradicted by two relevant explanatory notes.first,the explanatory note to chapter provides that the products of heading need not contain subsidiary pharmaceutical or disinfectant constituents,nor be held out as having therapeutic or prophylactic value.id.second,the explanatory note to heading provides that the heading encompasses m outh washes and oral perfumes.id.thus,we concluded that the court of international trade went too far in requiring that a product under heading include an antimicrobial agent.id.
finally,we pointed out some of the characteristics of certs powerful mints that made classification within heading appropriate.specifically,we noted that the mints contained certain flavors that masked malodor,copper gluconate that breaks down volatile compounds,and cottonseed oil that absorbs volatile compounds.id.at.in addition,we noted that consumption of the mints increased salivation,thereby purging bacteria located in the oral cavity.id.based upon our analysis,we held that certs powerful mints properly fall under heading of the htsus.id.at.we therefore reversed the decision of the court of international trade granting summary judgment in favor of the united states.id.
in this case,the court of international trade was presented with for summary judgment.the government moved for summary judgment that the magikstrips are not prima facie classifiable under htsus subheading and,thus,that they properly fall within the catchall subheading that was applied by customs.the government argued that our decision in stood for the proposition that in order for products to be classified as preparations for oral or dental hygiene,the products must be able to achieve the breakdown and absorption of unwanted substances in the mouth and provide a cleansing effect by purging activity.drygel,d at.in other words,the government argued that only products with all of the same cleansing characteristics as the certs powerful mints in can be classified as preparations for oral or dental hygiene under subheading.the government contended that summary judgment was appropriate because drygel failed to adduce sufficient evidence with respect to the breakdown,absorption,and purging its imported magikstrips.
drygel responded that summary judgment for the government was not proper,contending that its evidence raised genuine issues of material fact with respect to whether the magikstrips contain antimicrobial ingredients and whether the magikstrips contain ingredients that achieve breakdown,absorption,and purging effects discussed in.in addition,however,drygel argued that the government misinterpreted the holding of.according to drygel,we merely held in that the breakdown,absorption,and purging effects of certs powerful mints were sufficient to bring their classification within subheading we did not hold that they are necessary conditions for classification within that subheading.
finally,drygel affirmatively moved for summary judgment that the imported magikstrips are classifiable within subheading because they are oral perfumes.drygel argued that summary judgment in its favor was appropriate because as a matter of law,subheading encompasses oral perfumes and there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the magikstrips are,at a minimum,oral perfumes.
the court of international trade denied drygel for summary judgment and granted the government.the court rejected drygel argument that htsus heading encompasses oral perfumes.according to the court,although our decision noted the reference to m outh washes and oral perfumes in the explanatory note to heading,our holding ultimately relied upon the cleansing properties of certs powerful mints.id.at.further,the court observed that the explanatory notes are merely a interpretive guide.id.thus,the court concluded that instructs that the term hygiene requires a cleansing action such as the breakdown and absorption function and cleansing effect of the purging activity of certs powerful mints.id.the court determined that drygel had not established a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the magikstrips accomplish the requisite cleansing,whether the magikstrips are antimicrobial or achieve a breakdown,absorption,and purging effect.id.the court discounted drygel evidence in that regard as either,irrelevant,or conclusory.id.accordingly,the court entered summary judgment in favor of the government that the magikstrips were properly classified by customs in htsus subheading.
