ford motor company ford appeals from a final judgment of the united states court of international trade trade court.the trade court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction ford action challenging the denial by customs and border protection customs of ford claims for duty refunds under the north american free trade agreement,hereinafter nafta.ford motor united states,slip.int l trade.we reverse the trade court jurisdictional decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
nafta is a trade agreement between the united states,canada,and mexico which seeks to promote the free flow of goods between the member countries.imports that qualify for preferential treatment under nafta are permitted to enter the united states duty free.pursuant to article of nafta,imports are eligible for preferential treatment if the importer 
a make s a written declaration,based on a valid certificate of origin,that the good qualifies as an originating good 
b ha s the certificate in its possession at the time the declaration is made 
c provide s,on the request of that party custom administration,a copy of the certificate and 
d promptly make s a corrected declaration and pay s any duties owing where the importer has reason to believe that a certificate on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct.
nafta,at.this provision is implemented in the nafta implementation act,stat codified as amended at,and.an importer that does not meet these requirements at the time of entry is not barred from making a claim for preferential treatment.under nafta article,an importer that does not claim preferential treatment at the time of entry may nonetheless qualify for a duty refund.nafta,at.that provision is implemented by d,which provides 
notwithstanding the fact that a valid protest was not filed,the customs service may,in accordance with regulations prescribed by the secretary,reliquidate an entry to refund any excess duties paid on a good qualifying under the rules of origin set out in section of this title for which no claim for preferential tariff treatment was made at the time of importation if the importer,within year after the date of importation,files,in accordance with those regulations,a claim that includes 
a written declaration that the good qualifies for preferential treatment at the time of importation 
copies of all applicable nafta certificates of origin as defined in section b of this title and 
such other documentation and information relating to the importation of the goods as the customs service may require.

this case arises from ford attempt to claim preferential treatment under nafta for certain shipments of automotive parts imported into the united states from canada.ford imported the shipments from canada between january and january.the parties have agreed to use entry,which entered the united states on june,as a test case.ford did not assert at the time of entry that its goods were eligible for preferential treatment under nafta.ford electronically filed a duty refund claim on may,less than one year after the date of importation,asserting that it was entitled to reliquidation and a duty refund under d.however,ford may claim did not include copies of pertinent nafta certificates of origin as required by d.ford did not submit the relevant certificates of origin to customs until november,over a year after the date of importation.customs denied ford claim,stating that t he nafta certificate of origin was not furnished within one year of the date of importation.ford filed a protest to contest the denial,and customs denied the protest on the same grounds.ford appealed customs decision to the trade court.
before the trade court,ford argued,inter alia,that even though it submitted its certificates of origin more than a year after importation,it filed a claim within one year as required by d,and the certificates of origin were not an essential part of that claim for jurisdictional purposes.ford argued that customs should have accepted its certificates pursuant to,which provides that,
w henever a free entry or a reduced duty document,form,or statement required to be filed in connection with the entry is not filed at the time of the entry or within the period for which a bond was filed for its production,but failure to file it was not due to willful negligence or fraudulent intent,such document,form,or statement may be filed at any time prior to the liquidation of the entry or,if the entry was liquidated,before the liquidation becomes final.
id.emphasis added.the government disagreed and moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that the submission of nafta certificates of origin within one year was a jurisdictional prerequisite.
the trade court granted the government motion,reasoning that,under a,customs must reach a decision on a protest before the trade court may exercise jurisdiction,and customs can not address the merits of a protest,and therefore make a protestable decision,in the absence of a claim filed in accordance with law.ford,slip op.at.the trade court found that ford had not filed a valid d claim based on this court decisions in xerox united states,and corrpro,united states.as discussed below,these cases held that the timely filing of a claim under d was a jurisdictional prerequisite,but they did not involve as ford that were timely filed but lacking certificates of origin.nonetheless,the trade court interpreted xerox and corrpro as unambiguously requir ing that any claim for nafta treatment made pursuant to d must include timely filed certificates of origin to be valid.ford,slip op.at.because ford failed to file its certificates within one year of importation,the court found that ford had not filed a valid d claim from which customs could have rendered a protestable decision.ford,slip op.at.
ford timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the question presented in this case is whether the trade court lacks jurisdiction to review a customs decision denying an importer d rebate claim where the importer filed a claim with customs within one year after the date of entry,but did not file the pertinent certificates of origin within that one year period.we hold that ford untimely filing of its certificates of origin did not deprive the trade court of jurisdiction to hear ford claim.
it is clear that d requires importers to file a claim within one year after the date of importation.under a,the trade court has exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action commenced to contest the denial of a protest,in whole or in part,under section of the tariff act of.in xerox and corrpro,we held that,for there to be a protestable decision giving rise to a trade court jurisdiction,claims under d must be timely filed within one year of importation.see xerox,at corrpro,at.
in xerox,we found that there was no protestable decision giving rise to a trade court jurisdiction because the petitioner had failed to raise in the first instance a claim for preferential treatment under nafta within one year after entry.at.that is,unlike the present case,it was not until more than a year after importation that the petitioner in xerox asserted for the first time that its entries were entitled to a preference.id.at.similarly,in corrpro,we again found there to be no protestable decision because the petitioner concede d that it did not make a nafta claim within a year of entry.at.thus,in both xerox and corrpro,the importers did not file notice of any d claims at all until more than one year after their dates of importation.in contrast,ford imported its representative shipment on june,and filed notice of its d claim with customs less than a year later on may.
while xerox and corrpro held that d one year time limitation is jurisdictional insofar as it requires the timely filing of a claim,the question presented in ford case is whether submission of a certificate of origin together with the claim is also a jurisdictional requirement.neither xerox nor corrpro addressed whether failure to timely file a certificate of origin is by itself a jurisdictional bar to re
