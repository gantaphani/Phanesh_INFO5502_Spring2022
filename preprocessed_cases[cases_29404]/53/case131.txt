factual and procedural background 
dean myring,lozen president,arranged with to transport three containers of grapes from hermosillo,mexico,to felixstowe,england.the containers were to travel by truck from hermosillo to long beach,california.from there,they were to be transported by rail to elizabeth,new jersey,where they were to be loaded on the mathilde maersk maersk,an ocean vessel that would be stopping in felixstowe.the estimated departure date of the maersk was june,with an estimated arrival in felixstowe on june.
unfortunately,railroad agent placed the containers on the wrong train.as a result,lozen grapes did not arrive in new jersey in time for the sailing of the maersk.notified lozen of the problem and asked whether the company preferred to send the containers on the next week vessel or,instead,to sell them domestically.after its customer in england agreed to buy the delayed grapes only at a reduced price,lozen elected to sell them domestically at lower prices than it would have received under its original contract with the customer in england.a week delay in arrival of the grapes in england was critical because,by then,cheaper european grapes were expected to flood the market.
filed this action to recover the full amount of its contract with lozen to transport the containers of grapes.lozen answered and counterclaimed,arguing that,as a result of delay in transporting the containers,it suffered damages when it sold its grapes domestically at distressed prices.the parties settled original claim,and the district court granted a stipulated request for dismissal.however,the parties were unable to reach agreement with respect to lozen counterclaim for breach of contract and its counterclaim for cargo loss and damage pursuant to sections and of the interstate commerce act.the district court granted motion for summary judgment with respect to both counterclaims,and lozen filed a timely notice of appeal.

discussion 
jurisdiction 
before addressing the merits,we first must determine whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over lozen federal and state counterclaims.herman family revocable trust teddy bear,cir.questions the court jurisdiction,but we conclude that the court had authority to proceed as it did.
lozen filed one of its counterclaims pursuant to sections and of the interstate commerce act,commonly called the carmack amendment.because lozen sought damages in excess of,the district court had jurisdiction over this claim under a.hunter united van lines,cir.although lozen carmack amendment claim turned out to be unsuccessful,it was not insubstantial,that is,absolutely devoid of merit or obviously frivolous.brady brown,cir quoting gilder pga tour,cir.therefore,the district court had jurisdiction over it.id.
the court original jurisdiction over the carmack amendment claim gave it power to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over lozen counterclaim.a.because the federal and state counterclaims arise from the same transaction and rely on identical facts for their resolution,they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii for the purposes of supplemental jurisdiction.id.although the district court could have dismissed lozen claim after dismissing the carmack amendment claim,it did not abuse its discretion by choosing to entertain the merits of the claim.c acri varian,cir en banc.
terms of the parties agreement 
lozen and dispute the nature of the agreement between them and the terms governing that agreement.lozen argues that the parties entered into a special oral contract whereby expressly promised to deliver the three containers of grapes by a certain date,on the other hand,argues that the terms of its international bills of lading constitute the parties agreement.those terms provided with some latitude as to the date by which it was required to deliver the three containers.the district court adopted the latter construction of the parties agreement,and we agree.
this dispute arises because lozen requested that express sea waybills of lading be used in the transportation of its grapes had this been a traditional shipment,documents incorporating the terms on international bills of lading would have been printed by and given to lozen.however,express sea waybills are issued electronically,and did not give a printed copy to lozen.
lozen claims that,when it entered into the shipping agreement,it was unaware that the terms printed on international bills of lading also typically apply to shipments sent via its electronic sea waybills.lozen further asserts that,regardless of the terms applicable to other shipments of this type,the parties entered into a special oral agreement with respect to this particular shipment and that expressly guaranteed the date by which the grapes would arrive.
those arguments are unpersuasive on this record.dean myring,lozen president,twice conceded in his deposition that he could recall no specific details about the formation of the alleged special oral contract.he also admitted that,like other carriers,never guaranteed specific delivery times 
they are not guaranteed.in,if they were guaranteed would be opening themselves up carrier would be opening themselves up to all sorts of fun and games if they put a cast iron guarantee on something.
as demonstrated by a fax that he sent to a domestic agent,myring knew that the carriers sealand,maersk,mitsui,all of them have an out based on international shipping regulations and so a week s delay is not considered late.moreover,any shipping line does totally guarantee a timely delivery,an eta is exactly what it says,an estimated time of arrival.
myring deposition also reveals that he had shipped cargo several times before under traditional bills of lading.in addition,myring admitted that he had read the reverse side of bills of lading before initiating the shipment at issue here.perhaps most importantly,myring demonstrated his awareness that the terms printed on traditional bills of lading generally apply to express sea waybills 
q was it your understanding that when cargo was moving under an express sea way bill that it was still moving under the terms and conditions of bills of lading 
i think that is a fair statement.
this evidence alone justifies a conclusion that the terms printed on bills of lading control the parties agreement we have held that actual possession of the bill of lading is unnecessary in situations like this one,in which a shipper is familiar as a matter of commercial practice with the terms and limitations of bill of lading.royal ins.serv,cir see also travelers indem.vessel sam houston,cir holding that a sophisticated shipper who had used the carrier on previous occasions and was familiar with its bill of lading failed to raise a question of material fact as to whether it was denied a fair opportunity to opt out of the liability clause in the bill of lading.
submitted other evidence,in addition to the deposition testimony,that myring had read the terms on bills of lading and understood that they controlled the parties agreement.for example,in an to,myring wrote i understand what written on the back of your bills of lading and you ca guarantee deliveries due to certain circumstances.similarly,in an to lozen customer in england,myring wrote sorry about this but,as have sic politely pointed out,read the back of any ocean bill and there is no guarantee of delivery date and so for a week delay there bugger all that they going to do about it.
in the face of this evidence,lozen concedes that did not agree to deliver the containers of grapes to england by a certain date but,instead,asserts that promised that the containers would be shipped to new jersey in time to be loaded on the maersk.the record does not allow that inference.
presented considerable evidence that it did not guarantee that the containers would be delivered to any location by a specific date,that it is not the practice of sea land or other carriers to make such guarantees,and that lozen knew that the terms on international bills of lading governed both the inland and oversea legs of the shipment.in response,lozen presented no evidence that orally guaranteed timely delivery of the grapes to new jersey but,instead,offered only bare allegations as to the existence of a special agreement.accordingly,there is no genuine issue of fact as to whether myring had read bills of lading and knew that they,rather than an alleged oral guarantee,governed the parties agreement.
application of cogsa to the parties agreement 
the district court applied cogsa in its analysis of the extent of liability.lozen argues that,instead,the court should have applied either the carmack amendment or the harter act.
cogsa applies to e very bill of lading or similar document of title which is evidence of a contract for the carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the united states,in foreign trade.emphasis added.lozen argues that,because was hired to transport the containers of grapes from hermosillo,mexico,to felixstowe,england,the district court erred in holding that cogsa applies to the shipment.see,people ins.of china damodar tanabe in re damodar bulk carriers,cir finding cogsa inapplicable to a shipment from chile to china,despite the fact that the ocean carrier made a scheduled stop in hawaii.
lozen point is correct but,in the circumstances here,incomplete.even though cogsa does not apply by its own force to the shipment international bills of lading contain a clause paramount that explicitly incorporates the statute into the contract between the parties.we have repeatedly enforced such clauses.see,royal,at inst.of london underwriters,cir.accordingly,the district court did not err in holding that cogsa applied to the parties agreement as a matter of contract.
the district court also properly concluded that no other statute applied.first,the carmack amendment is inapplicable because as potentially relevant here that statute determines carrier liability only for transportation in the united states between a place in the united states and another place in the united states through a foreign country or the united states and a place in a foreign country.a e,f see also id.lozen containers were to be shipped from mexico to england.lozen citation of neptune orient lines,burlington northern santa fe railway,cir,is therefore inapposite because the goods in that case were shipped from jakarta,indonesia,to memphis,tennessee.
for a similar reason,the harter act does not apply to the shipment at issue to the extent that the harter act governed international trade leaving from or entering american ports,it was superseded in by the carriage of goods by sea act the harter act therefore only governs domestic trade.river ins.fed pac line,cir see also sunkist growers,adelaide shipping lines,cir it is well recognized that the hague rules or cogsa have superseded the harter act with respect to foreign trade.moreover,because cogsa is incorporated by contract into bills of lading,it,rather than the harter act,controls.river,at.
unreasonable deviation and liberty clauses 
lozen argues that delay caused by csx,railroad agent,constituted an unreasonable deviation,which releases lozen from the terms of bills of lading.responds that the agent behavior did not rise to the level of an unreasonable deviation and that,therefore,two liberty clauses in its bills of lading protect it from liability 
a deviation is defined under admiralty law as a voluntary departure without necessity,or any reasonable cause,from the regular and usual course of the voyage.vision air flight,pride,cir quoting constable.in order for a deviation to be unreasonable,the carrier must intentionally have caused damage to the shipper goods.id.at.even when a carrier has engaged in gross negligence or recklessness,such behavior does not constitute an unreasonable deviation.id.
lozen concedes that the initial misrouting of its containers was an accident and that this error alone did not constitute an unreasonable deviation.see vistar,express,cir holding that there was no unreasonable deviation in the absence of evidence that a truck driver intentionally and deliberately deviated from the instructed route.instead,lozen argues that csx behavior after discovering the error was an unreasonable deviation.it asserts that attempted to minimize the delay caused by the misrouting error,but that csx deliberately refused to cooperate despite its knowledge of the damaging consequences.according to lozen,csx inaction amounted to intentional causation of damage and,accordingly,constituted an unreasonable deviation.
in exhibit,an internal company one of employees admitted 
i got with csx to see if we could get containers taken from the train i not sure why csx decided to rail them.had we been able to truck these units,we could made the vessel w e had plenty of time to get these units,had csx allowed us to get our hands on them as we asked repeatedly.i kept telling lisa tapley that these units were vessel protected loads,and they had to make the vessel.there was no ambiguity in my needs,with regards these units.it comes down to me wanting to truck these units,from syracuse,as our recovery plan,but csx,in their infinite wisdom,decided not to allow us to do this.this is totally,and completely a csx failure.
also wrote a letter to lozen,stating in part 
we are very disappointed in the unfortunate delay caused by the rail and our inability to get cooperation from the rail operators.while we did track and trace these reefer loads most diligently,the railroad failed to follow our instructions and deramp the loads so we could truck them the rest of the way to elizabeth port.
together,these two communications permit a reasonable finder of fact to infer that csx intentionally caused the damage that lozen suffered.there is,therefore,a
