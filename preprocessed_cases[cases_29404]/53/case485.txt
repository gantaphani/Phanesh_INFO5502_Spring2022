this is an appeal by structural industries,challenging the court of international trade grant of summary judgment in favor of the bureau of customs and border protection customs formerly known as the united states customs service in structural industries,united states,d.int l trade.we affirm the court of international trade insofar as it held that the goods at issue could not be classified under heading or heading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus.however,finding that genuine issues of material fact remain as to the essential character of the goods at issue,and thus whether they should be classified under heading or heading,we vacate the court of international trade grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in,structural industries imported clip frames of various sizes to the united states.each frame consisted of three components a flat glass cover,a masonite wood board,and a set of four metal clips.a picture or document is placed between the masonite board and glass,and the four removable metal clips insert into slits in the masonite board to secure it to the glass cover.customs classified and liquidated these clip frames under heading of the htsus,which covers g lassware of a kind used for table,kitchen,toilet,office,indoor decoration or similar purposes other than that of heading or.htsus emphasis added.structural industries protested this classification,arguing that the clip frames were improperly classified as glass for indoor decoration and should have been classified either as o ther articles of wood under htsus heading or as another form of glass under heading or heading.heading includes g lass of heading cast glass and rolled glass,drawn glass and blown glass or float glass and surface ground or polished glass,bent,engraved,drilled,enameled or otherwise worked,but not framed or fitted with other materials,htsus,and heading is a residual basket category encompassing all o ther articles of glass,htsus.customs rejected structural industries contentions,and in may of structural industries protested the classification in the court of international trade.
on december,the court of international trade granted summary judgment in favor of customs,upholding its classification of the clip frames under htsus heading.the court noted that rule b of the general rules of interpretation gri,which accompany the htsus and guide customs in classifying imports,states that when the imported merchandise is composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components they shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character,insofar as this criterion is applicable,gri b emphasis added.the court also considered the explanatory note for gri b,which expounds on the concept of essential character,stating that t he factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods and may be determined by the nature of the material or component,its bulk,quantity,weight or value,or by the role of a constituent material in relation to the use of the goods.structural,d at quoting harmonized commodity description and coding system,explanatory notes explanatory notes,note to rule b,viii ed.
the court of international trade found that the clip frames at issue were composite goods governed by gri b,classifiable as either other articles of wood under subheading or as glassware of a kind used for indoor decoration under subheading.finding that the glass component provide d the subject merchandise with its essential character,the court held that customs had properly classified the clip frames under subheading.id.at.the court rejected structural industries contention that the clip frames should have been classified under a glass heading other than,explaining that neither of the alternative headings urged by structural industries was appropriate.the merchandise could not be categorized under heading because that category specifically excludes glass that is framed or fitted with other materials,and the glass at issue was fitted with masonite and metal clips.id.at quoting htsus.the court deemed heading a basket provision which is used only when the item is not properly classifiable under some other heading of the htsus and explained that was inappropriate in this context because the clip frames were properly classifiable under heading.id.

discussion 
we review the court of international trade grant of summary judgment without deference.mead united states.
assuming arguendo that the clip frames derive their essential character from glass and should be classified as such,structural industries argues that the court of international trade erroneously upheld customs classification of the clip frames under as g lassware of a kind used for table,kitchen,toilet,office,indoor decoration or similar purposes.instead,structural industries argues,the clip frames should have been classified as glass products under either heading or heading 
following the briefing in this current case we announced our decision in pomeroy.although neither party saw fit to call our attention to this decision as supplemental authority,it requires rejection of all of the appellant contentions in favor of classification under heading or.in pomeroy,an importer contested the classification of certain goods under as g lassware used for indoor decoration,arguing that the goods should have been classified as o ther articles of glass under heading.id.at.the goods at issue in pomeroy consisted of glass vessels supported by wrought iron pedestals that could be used to hold candles,wine bottles,flowers,id.the parties in pomeroy agreed that glass provided the goods their essential character,and the issue in pomeroy centered on the appropriate classification of composite goods according to gri b.
like the appellant in pomeroy,structural industries contends that even if the essential character of the clip frames is glass,gri b requires that it be classified as the component which gives it its essential character.gri b emphasis added.therefore,structural industries argues that the clip frames should be classified under heading because the glass component of the frames would be classified under heading if imported alone.we reject this reasoning here just as we rejected it in pomeroy,where we held that goods must be classified in the form in which they are imported.pomeroy,at.although the essential character inquiry focuses on an individual component of the goods,the goods are not classified as though they were composed exclusively of that component.
structural industries further argues that even if heading does not cover the clip frames,they should not be classified under heading because the explanatory note to that section states that a rticles of glass combined with other materials base metal,wood,are classified in this heading only if the glass gives the whole the character of glass articles.explanatory note second emphasis added.structural industries contends that this whole character requirement provides an extra prerequisite for classification of composite goods under heading,beyond the gri b essential character requirement.as such,structural industries urges that because the glass component of the clip frames does not meet heading whole character requirement,the goods should be classified under the residual basket heading for glass which does not require that glass provide the whole character of the product.our decision in pomeroy rejected this argument as well.we held in pomeroy that t he essential character inquiry and the phrase gives the whole the character of the articles do not set out different standards,pomeroy,at quoting explanatory note alteration in the original,and that the whole character phraseology in does not create a more restrictive standard than the essential character requirement in gri b,id.at.likewise,we must reject structural industries argument that the
