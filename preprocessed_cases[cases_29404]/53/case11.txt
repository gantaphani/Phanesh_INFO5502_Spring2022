federal treasury enterprise sojuzplodoimport fte appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york daniels,arising from litigation over ownership of the famous stolichnaya vodka trademarks.fte,an entity created by the russian government and purportedly granted rights by the government to manage the trademarks,sued two groups of defendants spirits international,spi spirits limited,spi group sa,yuri shefler,and alexey oliynik collectively,the spi defendants,who also claim to be the lawful owners of the trademarks,and allied domecq international holdings and allied domecq spirts wine usa,collectively,allied domecq,to whom spi has assigned its purported ownership rights.fte complaint asserted a variety of lanham act and related claims.see et.the principal dispute in the district court was essentially whether allied domecq claimed rights in the marks had become incontestable under the lanham act.see.the district court concluded that the marks had become incontestable,and that therefore fte could not challenge the validity of their assignment to allied domecq.the district court also considered and dismissed certain of fte claims.because we conclude that the district court improperly conflated incontestability with the analytically distinct issue of whether a subsequent transfer of the marks was valid,we hold that fte may challenge allied domecq claim of ownership of the marks in a federal action.accordingly,we vacate the portion of the judgment that relates to the trademark claims.in a summary order filed contemporaneously with this opinion,we affirm the district court dismissal of the fraud and unjust enrichment claims.
background 
when reviewing a district court dismissal under rule b,we accept as true the nonconclusory factual allegations in a complaint.see ashcroft iqbal.the second amended complaint the complaint alleges a complicated set of events by which the defendants supposedly obtained record title and control of a group of american trademarks that relate to the stolichnaya mark.stolichnaya is russian for from the capital,and is the name that the soviet government used to market the vodka both domestically and abroad prior to the collapse of the soviet union.as part of this marketing,the association sojuzplodoimport,a entity,registered a trademark for stolichnaya with the united states patent and trademark office in february registration.in,became the foreign economic association sojuzplodoimport.in,assigned the rights to the american trademarks,along with the authorization to import vodka under those marks into the united states,to the american corporation pepsico,in a contract which provided that the marks would revert to in.these facts are not in dispute.
what happened after the assignment to pepsico pepsico,is,however,hotly contested.broadly stated,the disputed facts involve a series of allegedly unlawful transactions transferring russia rights to the marks to privately held russian companies,who then transferred those rights to companies.the factual allegations in the complaint present the following complicated chain of events.
on december,the soviet union officially dissolved.at the time,the of the was evgeniy filoppovich sorochkin,who,in the ensuing confusion,designed a scheme with others of the staff to seize its assets for themselves.sorochkin took advantage of the privatization process that followed the dissolution of the soviet union and the conversion of the russian economy into a market economy,and in january registered a private russian corporation called the foreign economic joint stock company sojuplodoimport.sorochkin then took various transferring assets from to in were evidently sufficient to convince pepsico that was the successor of.in the two corporations entered into an agreement which adverted to the agreement between pepsico and and which referred to as the owner of the stolichnaya trademarks 
in,spawned a,which subsequently sold the reversionary rights from the pepsico contract to a new company,closed auction company sojuzplodimport one letter different from sojuzplodoimport,controlled by defendants yuri shefler and alexey oliynik two years later,while still under the control of shefler and oliynik,sold its rights to the marks to defendant spirits international,spirits international a dutch corporation headquartered in curacao is a subsidiary of defendant spi group sa a swiss company headquartered in geneva.plaintiff alleges that both of these corporations,together with defendant spi spirits limited a cypriot corporation,are managed and owned by shefler and oliynik.thus,plaintiff alleges,when transferred its purported trademark rights to spirits international,it was effectively transferring those rights to yet another corporate entity owned or controlled by shefler and oliynik,only this time to one located outside of russia.
in november,spi spirits and spirits international entered into an agreement with defendants allied domecq international holdings,a dutch corporation and allied domecq spirits wines usa,an american corporation,in which the spi entities agreed to assign the marks to allied domecq beginning in until,at which point the marks would revert to spi allied domecq then began marketing and selling stolichnaya vodka in the united states 
meanwhile,the state entity whose assets sorochkin transferred to his own private company,in following the dissolution of the soviet union continued to exist.in july,the russian government converted it to a different corporation,called federal state unitary enterprise economic association sojuzplodoimport fgup vo spi.that same year,russia government created plaintiff fte.in,after russia recovered rights to the russian stolichnaya marks from an spi entity,russia gave fte the rights to manage but not assign the russian stolichnaya trademarks,and in it charged fte with representing its interests relating to the recovery and registration of alcohol trademarks abroad this litigation resulted.
in,fte sued the spi entities,shefler,oliynik,and allied domecq in the southern district of new york fte asserted fifteen claims and sought a declaratory judgment and rectification of the trademark register.against all defendants,fte alleged fraud,misappropriation,unfair competition,and copyright infringement.against the spi defendants,fte also asserted claims of unjust enrichment,contributory trademark infringement,contributory trademark dilution,and contributory false designation of origin.against allied domecq,fte asserted claims of aiding and abetting fraud,trademark infringement,trademark dilution,and false designation of origin.fte also sought cancellation of certain marks.fte alleged that the district court had jurisdiction over its federal claims pursuant to federal question jurisdiction and usc jurisdiction over claims arising from acts of congress relating to trademarks and copyrights,and supplemental jurisdiction over its claims pursuant to.
on defendants motion to dismiss,the district court dismissed most of fte claims for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted.fed.treasury enter.sojuzplodoimport spirits int l.first,the district court held that fte trademark and misappropriation claims claims,and failed because they sought to challenge ownership of a trademark that had become incontestable under the lanham act,but had not alleged the existence of any of the act statutory exceptions to incontestability.the district court also dismissed the unfair competition and false designation of origin claims claim and claim for the same reason,except to the extent those claims alleged false advertising and marketing claims against allied domecq unrelated to the ownership of the stolichnaya trademarks.second,the district court dismissed the false advertising claims against the spi defendants on the ground that fte failed to plead that spi advertised in the united states.third,the district court dismissed fte fraud claims claims and on the ground that the only party which had relied on the allegedly fraudulent statements of the defendants was pepsico,not fte.fourth,the district court dismissed fte claim of unjust enrichment claim on the ground that the allegations did not establish entitlement to equitable relief.
after the district court dismissed the bulk of fte claims,fte voluntarily dismissed its remaining claim unfair competition due to false advertising or marketing against allied domecq,and the district court entered a final judgment.this appeal followed.we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim.in re nyse specialists sec,cir.
discussion 
the district court dismissed fte claims on the ground that the stolichnaya trademarks had become incontestable.the lanham act establishes a process by which a registered trademark may become incontestable.a registrant may take advantage of this procedure if there has been no final decision adverse to the trademark registrant claim of ownership over the mark there is no pending adjudication that would involve the ownership rights the registrant has filed an affidavit asserting that the mark has been in continuous use in commerce for five years after registration,is still in use,and that the first two conditions are met and the mark has not become a generic name for the goods and services for which it is registered.once these steps occur,the incontestable trademark provides evidence of the registrant ownership of that mark,subject to certain enumerated defenses,and accords the registrant the exclusive right to use the mark.b.the act also provides that the term registrant embrace s the assigns of a registered mark.
the district court concluded that the stolichnaya registration had become incontestable in,once,who registered the mark in,had satisfied the four conditions in.it also noted that the patent and trademark office pto identifies allied domecq as the record owner as the result of an assignment from pepsico.see note,supra.the district court then concluded that allied domecq could step into the shoes of pepsico and rely on the incontestable registration of the trademarks as conclusive evidence of ownership,and consequently concluded that fte could not pursue claims purportedly challenging allied domecq ownership of the marks.the district court then also rejected fte attempt to challenge the incontestable marks under one of the statutory defenses in the act.see b 
the district court analysis was mistaken in one very important respect it permitted allied domecq to step into the shoes of pepsico,the previous registrant of the marks,on the ground that under the lanham act the term registrant includes the assigns of a registrant.see.because,the district court reasoned,the marks were incontestable when held by,they continued to be incontestable when held by allied,consequently,fte claims failed.undoubtedly,the term registrant includes its assigns under the act,but we disagree with the district court that this conclusion ends the matter.the district court was also called upon to inquire whether a valid assignment had ever actually taken place.this inquiry was required because only after a valid assignment of trademarks does the assignee succeed to the rights of the assignor.see thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,at ed citing safe hall safe,holmes.obviously,an assignment obtained by fraud would not be valid.
the lanham act provides that the fact that an assignment is recorded in the united states patent and trademark office is prima facie evidence of execution of that assignment.a.prima facie evidence of execution is not the same as conclusive evidence of the validity of an assignment.as the pto has stated,t he mere act of recording an assignment document is a ministerial act,and t he assignment branch of pto does not examine the substance of the transaction rather,it records any assignment that appears on its face to be an assignment.in re ratny,com r pat.trademarks.since the act of recording a document is not a determination of the document validity,the existence of a recorded assignment does not preclude a party from establishing its ownership of the mark in a proper forum,such as a federal court.id.emphasis added see also louis altman and malla pollack,callmann on unfair competition,trade monopolies ed.if the mere fact that the registrant satisfied the requirements for incontestability could preclude fte claim,then incontestability would transform ministerial a mechanism for conclusively defeating allegations which must be credited on a motion to dismiss challenging the legality of the assignment.defendants statutory interpretation would lead to a perverse result in cases such as this,where all parties agree that the trademarks became incontestable in,but the disputed assignment comes from a series of transactions that occurred many years later.
as noted,none of the parties challenges the proposition that the marks became incontestable in,but fte challenges the validity of the transaction by which allied domecq purports to have been assigned the rights to those marks.indeed,fte main contention is that it,not allied domecq,is the legitimate to the incontestable marks because the series of events leading to the purported assignment to allied domecq was tainted by fraud.fte has the right to pursue this contention in court.incontestability was designed to protect the registration of the mark.b.although the lanham act does construe the term registrant to embrace assignees,we think that the district court read too much into this very general statement by effectively concluding that any recorded assignment of an incontestable registration can not be challenged.thus,if at the end of the day fte is able to prove that its marks were unlawfully assigned,then the district court would be obligated to consider appropriate relief 
having determined that the question of the validity of the assignment is antecedent to the question of incontestability,we now consider whether fte brought a proper challenge,in the proper forum,to that assignment.appellees essentially contend that fte can only bring a claim to challenge that assignment,and that,consequently,fte has no federal claim.we reject that contention.we accept the premise that state law or possibly russian law may govern the validity of the assignment from pepsico to allied domecq.however,we note that ownership of the relevant trademark is one of the necessary elements of trademark infringement under the lanham act.island software computer,microsoft,cir.accordingly,federal courts may,applying the relevant law,adjudicate the ownership of a trademark as part of an infringement claim.see,rare earth,hoorelbeke,i n order to determine the federal claim for infringement,the district court,as a preliminary matter,permits the plaintiff to establish the facts which underlie his claim of ownership.
in the related field of copyright,we have held that federal courts possess subject matter jurisdiction over a copyright claim so long as a complaint alleges a claim or seeks a remedy provided by the copyright act,even if the plaintiff seeking a copyright remedy is only entitled to that remedy on a prior showing of contractual entitlement,even if the court must first resolve a state law issue.bassett mashantucket pequot tribe,cir citing harms eliscu,cir friendly,until bassett,courts in this circuit were roughly divided into two camps,those who followed judge friendly face of the complaint test from harms,and those who looked beyond the complaint and followed the more demanding essence of the dispute test that we set forth in schoenberg shapolsky publishers,cir.see ryan volpone stamp,d.in bassett,we abrogated schoenberg,declaring the essence of the complaint test unworkable,and reaffirmed harms.bassett,at.bassett pointed out that if federal courts could not determine the issues intertwined with a copyright suit,then the plaintiff would be forced to litigate exclusively in state court and would be deprived of the remedies congress provided in the copyright act.id.at.
we conclude that similar concerns urge the same approach in trademark litigation.to adopt a contrary rule would leave plaintiffs who seek the remedies congress created under the lanham act with two unappealing options.one option would force plaintiffs to engag
