akebo abagninin and others who live and work in the ivory coast abagninin appeal the district court dismissal with prejudice of their claims against manufacturers,distributors,and users of the pesticide dbcp for genocide and crimes against humanity under the alien tort statute ats,abagninin alleges that dbcp caused male sterility and low sperm counts,which amvac knew.the district court granted with prejudice amvac motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the genocide claim for failure to allege that amvac acted with specific intent.abagninin claim for crimes against humanity was subsequently dismissed for failure to allege that amvac conduct occurred within the context of a state or organizational policy.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
abagninin is a west african foreign national who has resided and worked on banana and pineapple plantations in the ivory coast villages of kakoukro and ono.amvac is a private business entity that designed,manufactured,or required the use of the agricultural pesticide,dbcp.abagninin alleges that dbcp exposure caused male sterility and abnormally low sperm counts,and resulted in the prevention of births.
abagninin alleges that amvac knew of dbcp toxicity as early as the,and that by the fall of the use of dbcp was suspended in the united states.abagninin further alleges that despite knowing the negative health effects of dbcp,amvac continued manufacturing,selling,and using dbcp on the ivory coast plantations.dole food company,through its subsidiary standard fruit company,allegedly entered into partnership agreements with an ivory coast governmental entity known as société pour le développement de la production des fruitières et légumes sodefel.sodefel allegedly owned and operated the fruit plantations.under the alleged partnership agreements,dole food would purchase all fruit produced by the plantations,and sodefel would grow the fruit according to dole food specifications.these specifications allegedly included the use of dbcp produced by dow chemical company,shell oil company,or amvac chemical corporation.
abagninin contends that the partnership agreements and resulting use of dbcp caused sterility and low sperm counts in plantation workers,as a result of which they can not procreate.abagninin further contends that such conduct supports claims under the ats for genocide and crimes against humanity because the conduct was undertaken with knowledge of dbcp effects and pursuant to a state or organizational policy.the original complaint alleged genocide,crimes against humanity,racial discrimination,and unlawful distribution of pesticides in violation of the laws of nations.dow chemical moved for judgment on the pleadings under rule c,and amvac joined this motion.
on march,the district court dismissed with prejudice abagninin claims for genocide and unlawful distribution of pesticides.the district court found that abagninin failed to allege a violation of applicable norms of international law regarding genocide and unlawful distribution of pesticides.specifically,the district court held that genocide requires specific intent to destroy a particular group of victims,and that abagninin only alleged that amvac acted with knowledge of the consequences of dbcp.in so holding,the district court rejected abagninin argument that the rome statute of the international criminal court rome statute lowered the intent requirement for genocide to include knowledge the district court also dismissed the remaining claims,including the claim predicated on crimes against humanity.the district court held that these claims required an element of state action,and granted leave to amend to include allegations of state action.
abagninin filed the first amended complaint fac on april,alleging claims under the ats for crimes against humanity and racial discrimination.dow chemical filed a motion to dismiss under rule b which amvac joined.the district court found that the fac failed to sufficiently allege a state or organizational policy regarding sterilization.supplemental briefing was requested as to whether dismissal should be with prejudice or without prejudice,and whether to allow discovery regarding the state action requirement.the district court also indicated that defendants not yet served or appearing would be treated no differently than amvac as to lack of state action.all counsel present,including abagninin counsel,waived notice as to the dismissal of defendants.
the district court then held a hearing as to the nature of dismissal and proffered discovery.abagninin proffered discovery would only reveal whether or not the ivory coast government was aware of the use and consequences of dbcp.the district court determined that such information,indicating knowledge by the ivory coast,would not constitute state action.the district court therefore dismissed the remaining claims with prejudice,finding that abagninin proffered discovery would not establish conduct within the definition of state action.abagninin timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
the ats allows aliens to bring tort claims for violations of the law of nations or treaties of the united states.we will first discuss the scope of the ats before addressing the dismissal of abagninin claims for genocide and crimes against humanity.
the ats reads in its entirety the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.a treaty of the united states is a formal agreement between the united states and one or more other sovereigns,entered into by the president and approved by of the senate.const.art.ii,cl.vietnam ass for victims of agent orange dow chem,cir noting geneva protocol did not constitute a treaty of the united states under the ats until ratified.
the supreme court recently considered the ats in sosa,and made clear that any claim based on the law of nations must rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the paradigms of piracy,infringement on the rights of ambassadors,and violation of safe conducts,d although jurisdiction under the ats is not limited solely to these paradigms,it is subject to vigilant doorkeeping,id.at,as courts have no congressional mandate to seek out and define new and debatable violations of the law of nations.id.at.sosa also instructs that the determination whether a norm is sufficiently definite to support a cause of action should and,indeed,inevitably must involve an element of judgment about the practical consequences of making that cause available to litigants in the federal courts.id.at.
with these definitions and principles in mind,we turn to the genocide and crimes against humanity claims dismissed by the district court.as discussed below,abagninin allegations fail to state a claim for either cause of action under prevailing norms of international law.we are not empowered,as abagninin would urge,to extend and redefine these norms.
the common law distinguished between crimes requiring general intent and those requiring specific intent.united states bailey,d.the district court dismissed the genocide claim because abagninin failed to allege that amvac acted with specific intent,and denied leave to amend because the defect could not be cured.relying on the rome statute,abagninin contends that the original complaint sufficiently alleged genocidal as awareness that a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events.however,the knowledge intent standard is not part of a treaty of the united states or part of the law of nations.no treaty of the united states,no controlling act of the president or congress,and no judicial decision indicates that genocide is a norm.nor is there a sufficient consensus that it is a violation of international law to be aware that genocide will occur in the ordinary course of events.we therefore affirm.
treaty of the united states 
a treaty not ratified by the united states at the time of the alleged events can not form a basis for an ats claim.vietnam ass n,at flores peru copper,cir a state only becomes bound is,becomes a party treaty when it ratifies the treaty.citing haver yaker,wall.hawkins,d,noting that treaty to which the united states is a signatory,but has not yet ratified,is not binding on the united states,rev in part on other grounds by cir.it is undisputed that the united states has neither signed nor ratified the rome statute.int l criminal court,assembly of states parties,the states parties to the rome statute,available at.html last visited,see also letter from john bolton,under secretary of state for arms control and international security,to kofi annan,secretary general may,available at.gov r pa prs ps.htm stating that the united states does not intend to become a party to the rome statute.despite the lack of formal constitutional ratification,abagninin contends that the rome statute is nonetheless.this contention is without merit.see medellin texas,d what we mean by is that the treaty has automatic domestic effect as federal law upon ratification emphasis added.in order to state a claim based on the ats,abagninin must therefore demonstrate that the law of nations includes the rome statute intent standard.
law of nations 
the law of nations is synonymous with customary international law,flores,at,and violations of international law must contravene a norm that is specific,universal,and obligatory.sosa,at.abagninin confuses the issue by asserting a broader the fact that countries signed,and countries ratified,the rome statute demonstrates that its standards reflect a universal obligatory norm.the issue here,however,is narrower whether the rome statute definition reflects the kind of definiteness and acceptance among civilized nations that existed for sosa historical paradigms.the district court correctly held that it does not.
the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide genocide convention defines genocide as a specific intent crime.the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide,in the present convention,genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy,in whole or in part,a national,ethnical,racial or religious group,as such.as recently as,the genocide convention was recognized as the main source of customary international law regarding genocide.prosecutor brdanin,case no,judgment.
decisions from international tribunals also reflect the specific intent requirement for genocide.the international criminal tribunal for rwanda ictr definition of genocide was taken verbatim from the genocide convention.prosecutor akayesu,case no,judgment.thus the ictr defined genocide as a crime of specific intent.id.at t he specific intent in the crime of genocide lies in the intent to destroy,in whole or in part,a national,ethnical,racial,or religious group,as such.the international criminal tribunal for yugoslavia icty also adopted the element of specific intent for the crime of genocide,prosecutor krstic,case no,judgment,these demanding proof of specific intent and the showing that the group was targeted for destruction in its entirety or in substantial against a danger that convictions for this crime will be imposed lightly.prosecutor brdanin,case no,judgment,it is this specific intent that characterises the crime of genocide.no decision from either tribunal supports abagninin contention that genocide requires mere knowledge,or general intent.
abagninin asserts that his position is supported by the zyklon b cases,trial of bruno tesch and two others,tr.war crim.defendants in the zyklon b cases were accused of being accessories before the fact to war crimes committed mainly at auschwitz.id.at.the prosecution was based on article of the hague convention of,concerning the laws and customs of war on land.id.the defendants were charged with supplying poison gas used for the extermination of allied nationals interned in concentration camps well knowing that the said gas was to be so used.id.at.abagninin reliance on these cases is misplaced,however,for the defendants there were prosecuted for war crimes that were not specific intent offenses.
domestic materials similarly reject a definition of genocide based on mere knowledge.the federal genocide convention implementation act of implementation act largely adopted the genocide convention language,and explicitly defined genocide as requiring the specific intent to destroy,in whole or in substantial part,a national,ethnic,racial or religious group as such.a.this language follows the wording of the specific intent understanding that the senate included in the resolution of ratification to the genocide convention in order to distinguish between acts committed with the purpose of destroying a group and all other acts,at,as reprinted in.standing alone,this understanding would raise concerns regarding abagninin proposed intent standard,as it is highly unlikely that a purported principle of customary international law in direct conflict with the recognized practices and customs of the united states could be deemed to qualify as a bonafide customary international law principle.united states yousef,cir.however,the implementation act is in line with,rather than opposed to,the recognized principle of international law that requires specific intent for the crime of genocide.a.
the second circuit has recognized that dismissal of a genocide claim is appropriate when the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to show specific intent.in re agent orange prod.liability,d,aff,cir.in agent orange,vietnamese nationals brought genocide claims for harms allegedly resulting from the united states use of agent orange and other herbicides during the vietnam war.d at.the court dismissed the genocide claims,finding that the herbicides were not used with the specific intent to destroy any group.id.at.therefore the use of herbicides did not constitute genocide as defined by either the implementation act or the genocide convention,particularly with the united states understanding regarding specific intent.abagninin attempts to distinguish agent orange because the harmful effects of those chemicals were not known at the time assume,but incorrectly,that knowledge is the standard for intent.the key similarity between this case and agent orange is abagninin failure to allege that amvac intended to harm him through the use of chemicals.
abagninin original complaint failed to state an ats claim for genocide because it failed to allege facts showing violation of a norm.abagninin argues that intent can be inferred from what he has alleged even if measured against a norm requiring specific intent.for example,he points out,his original complaint avers that a shell employee who led that company research on dbcp stated with respect to plantation workers from what i hear,they could use a little birth control down there.however,no facts are set forth that this statement,assuming it was made as alleged,referred to the ivory coast or that it reflected the views of or could be attributed to shell or other manufacturers.abagninin also submits that his first amended complaint alleges that amvac acted with intent to prevent births and to destroy villages and their people,but these allegations do not pertain to the genocide claim,which was previously dismissed with prejudice.regardless,the allegations are conclusory,and thus would be insufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss in any event.see sprewell golden state warriors,cir.in sum,being unsupported by factual averments that show anything other than knowledge of a consequence,these allegations fail to make out a claim.
the rome statute is not a treaty of the united states,and customary international law defines genocide as requiring specific intent.furthermore,the united states government has clearly expressed its understanding regarding specific intent,and we have no congressional mandate to seek out and define new and debatable violations of the law of nations.sosa,at.abagninin presents no argument regarding dismissal without leave to amend,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering such dismissal.we therefore affirm the decision of the district court.
crimes against humanity 
abagninin also appeals the dismissal of the ats claim for crimes against humanity.as amvac does not dispute the point,we will assume,without deciding,that the norm for crimes against humanity is specific,obligatory,and universal.we also assume,because the parties do,that the rome statute accurately states the elements of a crime against humanity commission of any of the enumerated acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population,with knowledge of the attack rome statute.an attack directed against any civilian population is a course of conduct pursuant to or in furtherance of a state or organizational policy to commit such attack.id.a.abagninin contends that amvac is a business organization,and therefore used dbcp pursuant to an organizational policy.the district court properly concluded that abagninin failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute state or organization action as required for crimes against humanity.
organizational policy of amvac 
the traditional conception regarding crimes against humanity was that a policy must be present and must be that of a state,as was the case in nazi germany.prosecutor tadic,judgment,may.this conception was expanded to include entities which,although not a part of the legitimate government,have de facto control over a defined territory.id.the weakening of the state action requirement occurred because unofficial militias loosely affiliated with the state and unaffiliated civilians perpetrated the crimes in bosnia and rwanda,respectively.david luban,a theory of crimes against humanity,yale int l.a common thread throughout these developments is that crimes against humanity are crimes committed through political organization.id.at.
de facto control thus requires control similar to that of a state or government,such as erecting checkpoints on main roads,increasing examples of command and control,developing civilian structures,and holding a substantial percentage of territory.prosecutor limaj,judgment.decisions from the international criminal tribunal for rwanda require that actions by a organization be instigated or directed by a government or by any organisation or group,as a way to exclude the situation in which an individual commits an inhumane act in the absence of any encouragement or direction from either a government or a group or an organisation,prosecutor kayishema ruzindana,judgment,may.
the district court correctly concluded that amvac is not a state or organization for purposes of international law and crimes against humanity.abagninin does not argue that he sufficiently alleges de facto control by amvac over the territory.rather,abagninin argues that because the state action requirement has been relaxed to include organizations,and amvac is a business organization corporation,amvac acts satisfy the state or organization requirement.this reasoning,however,is not supported in customary international law.the modification of the state action requirement,precipitated by the involvement of militias and criminal syndicates,does not justify eliminating the requirement altogether.
state action by sodefel 
abagninin next contends that the fac alleged affirmative action by the government of the ivory coast.just as abagninin contends that any organization is sufficient for crimes against humanity,he contends that any involvement by the state meets the state action requirement.however,allegations of affirmative action by the government of the ivory coast fail to state a claim for crimes against humanity because abagninin does not allege that the use of dbcp was part of a plan or policy to commit one of the enumerated acts,to sterilize the plantation workers.rome statute.merely purchasing and providing dbcp for use on the plantations does not suffice,and the district court correctly found that the facts as alleged do not support abagninin conclusory statement that the use of dbcp was carried out pursuant to a state or organizational policy.lee city of los angeles,cir conclusory allegations of law,however,are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
denial of leave to amend 
with respect to the crimes against humanity claim,the district court did not err in denying leave to amend the fac.denial of leave to amend is reviewed for abuse of discretion.allen city of beverly hills,cir.leave to amend may be denied if a court determines that allegation of other facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency.schreiber distrib.furniture,cir.leave to amend may also be denied for repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendment.foman davis,d allen,at.
the district court first dismissed the crimes against humanity claim under rule c and granted leave to amend to include allegations of state action.after reaching a tentative ruling granting the motion to dismiss,the district court permitted supplemental briefing as to whether dismissal should be with prejudice,or without prejudice and allow limited discovery regarding the state action requirement.after reviewing abagninin proffered discovery,the district court found that the proffered discovery would not establish conduct within the definition of state action.the district court did not abuse its discretion,as allegations of other facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not cure the state action defect,and the previous amendment failed to cure this deficiency.
dismissal of defendants 
abagninin final contention on appeal is that the district court erred in dismissing the case as to all defendants,including those that had not appeared in the case and challenged the pleadings.abagninin contends that this was in error because the court did not give notice of its intention to dismiss and did not permit abagninin an opportunity to respond in opposition thereto.see lee city of los angeles,cir.this conclusion is not supported by the law or the facts in this case.
as a legal matter,we have upheld dismissal with prejudice in favor of a party which had not appeared,on the basis of facts presented by other defendants which had appeared.columbia steel fabricators,ahlstrom recovery,cir silverton dep t of treasury,cir a d istrict c ourt may properly on its own motion dismiss an action as to defendants who have not moved to dismiss where such defendants are in a position similar to that of moving defendants.the defendants in this case are in a position similar to amvac in that all are private actors for which abagninin can not allege specific intent required for genocide or state action or de facto control required for crimes against humanity.
as a factual matter,abagninin waived notice as to dismissal of the remaining defendants,and was provided an opportunity to be heard as to dismissal of the defendants.at the may,hearing,the district court stated i presume the plaintiffs case shell will not be any different than with the other defendants so that if i dismiss out the claim based on lack of state action that would apply to shell as well in other words,shell,to my mind,is not going to be any different it would seem to be on a theoretical basis than dow or dole.the court concluded that it would leave that hanging in the air.notice is waived on this abagninin counsel responded y es,your honor.the district court then permitted supplemental briefing and argument as to whether dismissal should be with or without prejudice.after considering the supplemental information,the court determined that the discovery proffered by abagninin would not lead to information which could amend the complaint to satisfy the state action requ
