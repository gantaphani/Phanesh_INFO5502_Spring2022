systeme fuer nutzfahrzeuge gmbh is the owner of united states patent the patent entitled disk brake for vehicles having insertable actuator,is sued on july.at trial to the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,the appellants dana corporation,haldex brake products corporation,and haldex brake products ab were found liable for infringement and willful infringement no damages were awarded,for there were no sales of the infringing brakes.based on the finding of willful infringement the court awarded partial attorney fees under.
the appellants seek reversal of the finding of willful infringement,arguing that an adverse inference should not have been drawn from the withholding by haldex of an opinion of counsel concerning the patent issues,and from the failure of dana to obtain its own opinion of counsel.applying our precedent,the district court inferred that the opinion of counsel withheld by haldex was unfavorable to the defendants.after argument of the appeal we took this case en banc in order to reconsider our precedent with respect to these aspects.the parties were asked to submit additional briefing on four questions,and amicus curiae briefs were invited,en banc order.
we now hold that no adverse inference that an opinion of counsel was or would have been unfavorable flows from an alleged infringer failure to obtain or produce an exculpatory opinion of counsel.precedent to the contrary is overruled.we therefore vacate the judgment of willful infringement and remand for,on consideration of the totality of the circumstances but without the evidentiary contribution or presumptive weight of an adverse inference that any opinion of counsel was or would have been unfavorable.
background 
a german corporation,manufactures air disk brakes for use in heavy commercial vehicles,primarily class trucks known as eighteen wheelers,semis,or.states that air disk brake technology is superior to the previously dominant technology of hydraulically or pneumatically actuated drum brakes,and that air disk brakes have widely supplanted drum brakes for trucks in the european market.
dana,an american corporation,and the swedish company haldex brake products ab and its united states affiliate,agreed to collaborate to sell in the united states an air disk brake manufactured by haldex in sweden.the appellants imported into the united states about units of a haldex brake designated the mark ii model.between and the mark ii brake was installed in approximately eighteen trucks of dana and various potential customers.the trucks were used in transport,and brake performance records were required to be kept and provided to dana.dana and haldex advertised these brakes at trade shows and in industry media in the united states.
in december orally notified dana of patent disputes with haldex in europe involving the mark ii brake,and told the appellants that patent applications were pending in the united states.on august,notified dana in writing of infringement litigation against haldex in europe,and that united states patent had issued on july.filed this infringement suit on may.in september haldex presented to the district court a modified brake design designated the mark iii,and moved for a summary declaration of by the mark iii brake.in turn moved for summary judgment of literal infringement by the mark ii brake,and infringement by the mark iii either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.after a hearing in november the district court granted motion for summary judgment of literal infringement by the mark ii brake,and set for trial the issues with respect to the mark iii.before and after the judgment of infringement by the mark ii,dana and others continued to operate trucks in the united states containing the mark ii brake.following a bench trial in january,the district court found literal infringement by the mark iii brake.
on the issue of willful infringement,haldex told the court that it had consulted european and united states counsel concerning patents,but declined to produce any legal opinion or to disclose the advice received,asserting the privilege.dana stated that it did not itself consult counsel,but relied on haldex.applying federal circuit precedent,the district court found it is reasonable to conclude that such opinions were unfavorable.the court discussed the evidence for and against willful infringement and concluded that the totality of the circumstances compels the conclusion that defendants use of the mark ii air disk brake,and indeed dana continued use of the mark ii air disk brake on various of its vehicles after the judgment of infringement amounts to willful infringement of the patent.ii,d at.based on the finding of willful infringement the court found that the case was exceptional under,and awarded its attorney fees for the portion of the litigation that related to the mark ii brake,but not the mark iii.
the appellants appeal only the issue of willfulness of the infringement and the ensuing award of attorney fees,seeking to enjoin the appellants from retaining and using the brake performance records and test data obtained through use of the mark ii brake.
willful infringement 
in discussing willful behavior and its consequences,the supreme court has observed that t he word willful is widely used in the law,and,although it has not by any means been given a perfectly consistent interpretation,it is generally understood to refer to conduct that is not merely negligent,mclaughlin richland shoe,d,the court citing conventional definitions such as voluntary,deliberate,and intentional.id.the concept of willful infringement is not simply a conduit for enhancement of damages it is a statement that patent infringement,like other civil wrongs,is disfavored,and intentional disregard of legal rights warrants deterrence.remedy for willful infringement is founded on the court may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed and the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.see generally aro convertible top replacement,d the patentee could in a case of willful or infringement recover punitive or increased damages under the statute trebling provision.
determination of willfulness is made on consideration of the totality of the circumstances,see gustafson,intersystems indus,and may include contributions of several factors,as compiled,in gte valeron,and read portec.these contributions are evaluated and weighed by the trier of fact,for,as this court remarked in kelley,w illfulness in infringement,as in life,is not an trait,but one of degree.it recognizes that infringement may range from unknowing,or accidental,to deliberate,or reckless,disregard of a patentee legal rights.
fundamental to determination of willful infringement is the duty to act in accordance with law.reinforcement of this duty was a foundation of the formation of the federal circuit court,at a time when widespread disregard of patent rights was undermining the national innovation incentive.see advisory committee on industrial innovation final report,dep t of commerce.thus in underwater devices,the court stressed the legal obligation to respect valid patent rights.the court opinion quoted the infringer attorney who,without obtaining review by patent counsel of the patents at issue,advised the client to continue to refuse to even discuss the payment of a royalty.id.at.the attorney advised that c ourts,in recent years,patent infringement the patents claimed to be infringed upon invalid in approximately of the cases,and that for this reason the patentee would probably not risk filing suit.id.on this record of flagrant disregard of presumptively valid patents without analysis,the federal circuit ruled that where,as here,a potential infringer has actual notice of another patent rights,he has an affirmative duty to exercise due care to determine whether or not he is infringing,including the duty to seek and obtain competent legal advice from counsel before the initiation of any possible infringing activity.id.at.
underwater devices did not raise any issue of privilege,while applying precedent that a finding of willfulness requires the factfinder to find by clear and convincing evidence that the infringer acted in disregard of the patent,citing stickle heublein.the aspect of privilege arose in kloster speedsteel ab crucible,where the federal circuit observed that the infringer has not even asserted that it sought advice of counsel when notified of the allowed claims and the patentee warning,or at any time before it began this litigation,and held that the infringer silence on the subject,in alleged reliance on the privilege,would warrant the conclusion that it either obtained no advice of counsel or did so and was advised that its importation and sale of the accused products would be an infringement of valid patents.id.at.thus arose the adverse inference,reinforced in fromson western litho plate supply,and establishing the general rule that a court must be free to infer that either no opinion was obtained or,if an opinion were obtained,it was contrary to the infringer desire to initiate or continue its use of the patentee invention.id.at.throughout this evolution the focus was not on relationships,but on disrespect for law.however,implementation of this precedent has resulted in inappropriate burdens on the relationship.
we took this case en banc to review this precedent.while judicial departure from stare decisis always requires special justification,arizona rumsey,d,the conceptual underpinnings of this precedent,see,have significantly diminished in force.the adverse inference that an opinion was or would have been unfavorable,flowing from the infringer failure to obtain or produce an exculpatory opinion of counsel,is no longer warranted.precedent authorizing such inference is overruled.
we answer the four questions presented for en banc review,as follows 
when the privilege privilege is invoked by a defendant in an infringement suit,is it appropriate for the trier of fact to draw an adverse inference with respect to willful infringement 
the answer is no.although the duty to respect the law is undiminished,no adverse inference shall arise from invocation of the work product privilege.
the supreme court describes the privilege as the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to common law,and has stressed the public purpose 
to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.the privilege recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer being fully informed by the client.
upjohn united states,d.professor wigmore has elaborated 
the lawyer must have the whole of his client case,or he can not pretend to give any useful advice that the whole will not be told to counsel unless the privilege is confidential,is perfectly clear.a man who seeks advice,seeks it because he believes that he may do so safely he will rarely make disclosure which may be used against him rather than create an adverse witness in his lawyer,he will refuse all private arbitration,and take the chance of a trial.
wigmore,evidence in trials at common law at mcnaughton.see hunt blackburn.the privilege is designed to encourage candid exchange of information.
although this court has never suggested that opinions of counsel concerning patents are not privileged,the inference that withheld opinions are adverse to the client actions can distort the relationship,in derogation of the foundations of that relationship.we conclude that a special rule affecting relationships in patent cases is not warranted.see swidler berlin united states,d ad hoc exceptions to privilege may cause general erosion.there should be no risk of liability in disclosures to and from counsel in patent matters such risk can intrude upon full communication and ultimately the public interest in encouraging open and confident relationships between client and attorney.as professor mccormick has explained,the privilege protects interests and relationships which are regarded as of sufficient social importance to justify some sacrifice of availability of evidence relevant to the administration of justice.mccormick on evidence,ed.
there is precedent for the drawing of adverse inferences in circumstances other than those involving relationships for example when a party refusal to testify or produce evidence in civil suits creates a presumption of an intent to withhold damaging information that is material to the litigation however,the courts have declined to impose adverse inferences on invocation of the privilege.see,nabisco,pf brands,cir no adverse inference from the defendant refusal to produce an opinion letter of counsel in a trademark dilution case,overruled on other grounds sub nom.moseley secret catalogue,d parker prudential insurance,cir no negative inference from assertion of privilege.we now hold that this rule applies to the same extent in patent cases as in other areas of law.a defendant may of course choose to waive the privilege and produce the advice of counsel.however,the assertion of privilege and the withholding of the advice of counsel shall no longer entail an adverse inference as to the nature of the advice.
when the defendant had not obtained legal advice,is it appropriate to draw an adverse inference with respect to willful infringement 
the answer,again,is no.the issue here is not of privilege,but whether there is a legal duty upon a potential infringer to consult with counsel,such that failure to do so will provide an inference or evidentiary presumption that such opinion would have been negative.
dana corporation did not seek independent legal advice,upon notice by of the pendency of the application in the united states and of the issuance of the patent,followed by the charge of infringement.in tandem with our holding that it is inappropriate to draw an adverse inference that undisclosed legal advice for which privilege is claimed was unfavorable,we also hold that it is inappropriate to draw a similar adverse inference from failure to consult counsel.the amici curiae describe the burdens and costs of the requirement,as pressed in litigation,for early and full study by counsel of every potentially adverse patent of which the defendant had knowledge,citing cases such as johns hopkins cellpro,wherein the court held that to avoid liability for willful infringement in that case,an exculpatory opinion of counsel must fully address all potential infringement and validity issues.although other cases have imposed less rigorous criteria,the issue has occasioned extensive satellite litigation,distorting the conceptual underpinnings of underwater devices and kloster speedsteel.although there continues to be an affirmative duty of due care to avoid infringement of the known patent rights of others,gear thom mcan shoe,the failure to obtain an exculpatory opinion of counsel shall no longer provide an adverse inference or evidentiary presumption that such an opinion would have been unfavorable.
if the court concludes that the law should be changed,and the adverse inference withdrawn as applied to this case,what are the consequences for this case 
the district court based its willfulness determination on several factors in addition to the adverse inference arising from the assertion of privilege by haldex and the failure of dana to obtain legal advice.this court has explained that there are no hard and fast per se rules with respect to willfulness of infringement,at.precedent illustrates various factors,some weighing on the side of culpability and some that are mitigating or ameliorating.see read portec,supra.
the district court found,on the evidence presented,that literal infringement by the mark ii brake was reasonably clear and did not present close legal or factual questions.as for the validity of the patent,the court found that given the quantity and quality of the evidence presented by defendants at trial on the issues of obviousness and indefiniteness,it can not fairly be said that defendants,throughout the litigation,had a good faith belief that the patent would ultimately be found invalid on these grounds.ii,d at.the court also found that the appellants failed to take prompt remedial action to terminate infringement after the judgment of literal infringement by the mark ii,stating that dana deliberately yielded to market pressures in deciding to continue using the infringing mark ii air disk brakes on test vehicles pending future receipt of replacement mark iii air disk brakes.id.the court also found that although haldex indeed developed the mark iii air disk brake in a good faith effort to design around the patent,haldex nonetheless continued to use the mark ii air disk brake throughout the redesign effort,including displaying mark ii air disk brakes at various automotive conferences in the united states and distributing mark ii promotional literature to potential customers at these conferences,the court also noted that infringement was not then enjoined.iii,at.
the district court also considered haldex invocation of the privilege in order to withhold its opinions of counsel,and dana failure to obtain an independent legal opinion despite the warning and notice of infringement.the appellants argue that but for the adverse inference of unfavorable opinions drawn from these actions,the finding of willfulness of infringement is not supported.responds that willful infringement is well supported by the remaining findings.because elimination of the adverse inference as drawn by the district court is a material change in the totality of the circumstances,a fresh weighing of the evidence is required to determine whether the defendants committed willful infringement.this determination is the primary responsibility and authority of the district court.we therefore vacate the finding of willful infringement and remand for redetermination of the issue.
several amici curiae raised the question of whether the trier of fact,particularly a jury,can or should be told whether or not counsel was consulted albeit without any inference as to the nature of the advice received as part of the totality of the circumstances relevant to the question of willful infringement.the amici pointed to various hypothetical circumstances in which such information could be relevant,even when there was no issue of privilege.that aspect is not raised by this case,was not before the district court,and has not been briefed on this appeal.today we resolve only the question of whether adverse inferences of unfavorable opinions can be drawn,and hold that they can not.
the appellants also argue that the award of attorney fees is a matter of punitive damages,and is therefore improper.precedent and statute do not support this position.provides that the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party and the court has confirmed that a finding of willful infringement may qualify a case as exceptional under.see,modine v.the allen group.that there were not actual damages does not render the award of attorney fees punitive.attorney fees are compensatory,and may provide a fair remedy in appropriate cases.upon a finding of willful infringement,the award of attorney fees is within the district court sound discretion.
in view of our vacatur of the finding of willful infringement,the award of attorney fees is also vacated.on remand the award may be reconsidered,should the judgment of willful infringement be restored.
should the existence of a substantial defense to infringement be sufficient to defeat liability for willful infringement even if no legal advice has been secured 
the answer is no.precedent includes this factor with others to be considered among the totality of circumstances,stressing the theme of whether a prudent person would have sound reason to believe that the patent was not infringed or was invalid or unenforceable,and would be so held if litigated,sri int l,advanced tech.labs.however,precedent also authorizes the trier of fact to accord each factor the weight warranted by its strength in the particular case.we deem this approach preferable to abstracting any factor for per se treatment,for this greater flexibility enables the trier of fact to fit the decision to all of the circumstances.we thus decline to adopt a per se rule.
the cross appeal 
the district court rejected request for destruction of the technical data that were obtained by the appellants for the haldex air disk brakes.the court found that much of the data were obtained before issuance of the patent,and that some of the data relate to aspects including efforts and safety studies.iii,at.we do not discern reversible error in the court decision of this issue.that decision is affirmed.
an adverse inference that a legal opinion was or would have been unfavorable shall not be drawn from invocation of the work product privileges or from failure to consult with counsel.contrary holdings and suggestions of precedent are overruled.
this case is remanded for redetermination of the issue of willful infringement and any remedy therefor.
each party shall bear its costs.
vacated and remanded affirmed 
i join the majority opinion insofar as it eliminates an adverse inference that an opinion of counsel would be unfavorable from the infringer failure to disclose or obtain an opinion of counsel.i do not join the majority opinion to the extent that it may be read as reaffirming that where,as here,a potential infringer has actual notice of another patent rights,he has an affirmative duty to exercise due care to determine whether or not he is infringing,ante,at quoting underwater devices.
there is a substantial question as to whether the due care requirement is consistent with the supreme court cases holding that punitive damages can only be awarded in situations where the conduct is reprehensible.see,state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d bmw of,gore,d gore.while the majority properly refrains from addressing this constitutional issue,as it has not been briefed or argued by the parties or amici in this case,i write separately to note my view that enhancing damages for failure to comply with the due care requirement can not be squared with those recent supreme court cases.
we have often recognized that enhanced damages awarded pursuant to are a form of punitive damages.see,sensonics,aerosonic,e nhanced damages are punitive,not compensatory.punitive damages are awarded to punish reprehensible behavior,referred to in this context as willful infringement.enhancement depends on a showing of willful infringement or other indicium of bad faith warranting punitive damages.see also presto,west bend,liability for willfulness of infringement turns on considerations of intent,state of mind,and culpability.beatrice foods new eng.printing lithographing,under our cases,enhanced damages may be awarded only as a penalty for an infringer increased culpability,namely willful infringement or bad faith.
there are many circumstances that may create an appropriate predicate for a finding of willful infringement,and hence punitive damages,including deliberate copying,concealing infringing activity,infringement where the infringer knows that it is infringing or where it knows it has only frivolous defenses,infringement designed to injure a competitor.we have appropriately held that such activity is reprehensible and that enhanced damages may be awarded in such circumstances.see,hoechst celanese bp chems,willful infringement is a measure of reasonable commercial behavior in the context of the tort of patent infringement.the extent to which the infringer disregarded the property rights of the patentee,the deliberateness of the tortious acts,or other manifestations of unethical or injurious commercial conduct,may provide grounds for a finding of willful infringement and the enhancement of damages.gear,thom mcan shoe,reversing the district court ruling that infringement was not willful because the infringer deliberate copying was strong evidence of willful infringement,without any exculpatory evidence to balance the weight read portec,including w hether defendant attempted to conceal its misconduct as a factor to be considered in enhancing damages kaufman lantech,affirming the district court finding of willful
