section of the trade act of,a,authorizes the president to take appropriate action to protect domestic industries from substantial injury due to increased quantities of imports.in june,the president requested that the commission conduct a section investigation of steel products imported between january and june.following its investigation,the commission determined that steel products were being imported into the united states in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry and recommended that safeguard tariffs be imposed on steel products.consequently,in march the president imposed safeguard tariffs on steel products,including steel products,of percent for the first year,percent for the second year,and percent for the third year.
in september,a number of domestic steel producers petitioned the commission to conduct the antidumping and countervailing duty investigations that gave rise to this case.the commission antidumping and countervailing duty investigations,which were directed to certain steel products,overlapped the section investigation and the subsequent imposition of tariffs on steel products.
the commission responsibility in an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation is to determine if a domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports.see b,b.material injury is defined as harm which is not inconsequential,immaterial,or unimportant.id.a.in order to make a material injury determination,the commission must consider the volume of the imports,the effect on prices of domestic like products due to the imports,and the impact of the imports on the domestic industry production.id.b i.when considering the volume of the imports,the commission must determine if the volume is significant.id.c i.when determining the effect on price,the commission must consider whether there has been significant price underselling and whether the domestic prices are depressed or suppressed because of the imports.id.c ii.
the commission issued final determinations on all of the subject investigations in september and november.in those determinations,the commission found that the section investigation and the president remedy fundamentally altered the market for many steel products,including steel.the commission found that imports of those products declined sharply and that domestic prices increased significantly in the period after the imposition of the section tariffs.the commission further reported that,according to purchasers,the reduction in imports due to the section tariffs had led to higher prices,supply shortages,and some broken or renegotiated contracts.based on the results of its investigation,the commission concluded that the section relief was the principal reason for the sharp decline in imports near the end of the investigation period.the commission further found that,as of the conclusion of the antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings,the domestic steel products industry is neither materially injured nor threatened with material injury by reason of subject imports.because the commission determined that the domestic industry was not suffering present material injury or a threat of material injury as a result of the subject imports,no antidumping or countervailing duties were imposed.
in the court of international trade,the domestic producers argued that the commission negative material injury determinations were flawed because,among other reasons,the commission failed to consider the effects of imports in the early portion of the investigation period it failed to make a determination regarding the significance of importers underselling of domestic producers and it erred in its determinations regarding the volume of imports and their impact on domestic prices.in a detailed opinion,the trial court sustained the commission determinations.
steel and nucor argue that the commission erred by failing to consider the effects of products imported prior to the imposition of section tariffs when it determined that the domestic industry was not suffering current material injury because of imports.in particular,they contend that the requirement in b and b that the commission determine whether the domestic industry is suffering material injury by reason of imports mandated that the commission consider the effects of imports throughout the period of investigation and not confine its consideration to the effects of current imports.because,in the appellants view,the commission based its material injury determinations solely on current imports,the appellants argue that the commission material injury determination was legally flawed.
the trial court held that the commission had reasonably construed the phrase by reason of imports in b and b to allow it to focus its investigation on the most recent import data.the court explained that the commission had investigated imports for the entire period of investigation.although the commission had focused mainly on current imports,it had also considered imports during the early portion of that period in assessing the volume of imports,their effects on price,and the overall impact of imports on the domestic industry.the commission particular focus on current imports,according to the trial court,was in accord with the remedial purpose of duties which are intended merely to prevent future harm to the domestic industry by reason of unfair imports that are presently causing material injury.the court also found that although the commission did not state explicitly that past imports were not causing present material injury,it implicitly made that determination.according to the court,the commission properly assessed the effects of imports early in the investigation period in light of the evidence that there was a steep decline in imports near the end of the investigation period.
sections b and b state that the commission must determine whether a domestic industry is materially injured by reason of imports.they do not specify how the commission should weigh imports early in the period of investigation as compared to imports closer to the date of decision,nor do they provide any guidance as to the considerations that should influence the weight the commission assigns to data from different portions of the investigation period.because the statutes are silent on those issues,and because the commission,together with the commerce department,is charged with the responsibility of administering the antidumping and countervailing duty statutes,the commission construction of those statutes is entitled to deference under the principles of chevron natural res.def.council,d.see comm.for fairly traded venezuelan cement united states,tx.crushed stone united states,suramerica de aleaciones laminadas united states.
we agree with the trial court that it was reasonable for the commission to interpret the statutory language to permit it to accord different weight to imports during different portions of the period of investigation depending on the facts of each case.in particular,the commission acted reasonably in construing the statutory language to permit it to focus on the most recent imports and pricing data.that construction is reasonable for several reasons.first,the purpose of antidumping and countervailing duty laws is remedial,not punitive or retaliatory,see chaparral steel united states,and current data typically is the most pertinent in determining whether remedial measures are necessary,see chr.bjelland seafoods united states.int l trade.second,section b i provides that,in making the material injury determination required by sections b and b,the commission shall consider,inter alia,the effects of the subject imports on domestic producers.section c iii in turn requires the commission,in determining the impact of the subject imports on domestic producers,to evaluate all relevant economic factors which have a bearing on the state of the industry in the united states.as the trial court explained,in most cases the most recent imports will have the greatest relevance to the current state of the domestic industry.third,the commission has broad discretion with respect to the period of investigation that it selects for purposes of making a material injury determination.as the court of international trade has explained,because the statute does not expressly command the commission to examine a particular period of time the commission has discretion to examine a period that most reasonably allows it to determine whether a domestic industry is injured by less than fair value imports.kenda rubber indus.united states.int l trade.since the commission has broad discretion to choose the most appropriate period of time for its investigation,it would be nonsensical to hold that once the commission has chosen an investigation period,it is required to give equal weight to imports throughout the period it has selected.for these reasons,both this court and the court of international trade have typically upheld the commission exercise of its discretion to focus on imports during particular portions of the investigation period,especially imports during the most recent portion of that period.see chaparral steel,at taiwan semiconductor indus.ass united states,d.int l trade,aff,angus chem.united states.int l trade,aff.
in this case,the fact that section tariffs were imposed during the period of investigation made the recent data far more probative than earlier data as to whether the industry was suffering present material injury as a result of imports.the commission found that the section relief was having a major impact in the market for steel and was the overwhelming factor in the sharp decline in subject imports during the most recent period examined.substantial evidence in the record supports that finding,and the appellants do not challenge the trial court determination in that regard.because the imposition of section tariffs had such a dramatic impact on the industry,it was reasonable for the commission to conclude that the most recent data was the most reliable indicator of whether the industry was suffering material injury as a result of the subject imports and whether the imposition of additional duties would be consistent with the remedial purposes of the antidumping and countervailing duty laws.
the appellants argue that the commission did not simply assign greater weight to current imports,but that it improperly focused exclusively on current imports and failed to give any consideration to whether the domestic industry was suffering material injury by reason of past imports.they contend that the record does not support the trial court conclusion that the commission examined imports over the entire investigation period in making its determination that the subject imports were not causing present material injury.
in making the statutory determination that the domestic steel industry was not suffering material injury by reason of the subject imports,the commission explained that it focused principally on the current volume of subject imports and the increase in domestic prices in.the commission concluded that the present condition of the domestic industry was not attributable in any material respect to the current subject imports and that subject imports are not adversely affecting domestic prices to a significant degree.its ultimate finding was that there was no material injury currently being experienced by the domestic industry by reason of the subject imports,the imports during the period of investigation.the commission thus explained that its material injury determination,although focusing mainly on current imports,was not restricted solely to current imports but encompassed all subject imports during the investigation period.
the appellants do not argue that past imports continued to cause material injury at the end of the investigation period because of accumulated inventories.nor could they,as the evidence showed that by the end of that period there were widespread supply shortages in the industry,and many producers had been placed on allocation.instead,the appellants argue that the commission ignored the continuing price effects of earlier imports resulting from the fact that the prices set in contracts made earlier in the period of investigation were generally locked in at the time of contract formation and continued in effect throughout the later portions of the investigation period.contrary to the appellants contention,however,the commission took those facts into consideration it simply did not find that they were sufficiently important to alter the ultimate material injury determination.thus,the commission noted that past imports continue d to have an effect on the industry contract prices negotiated before the section relief was effective,but it nonetheless concluded that imports were not adversely affecting domestic prices to a significant degree based on the current volume of subject imports and the increase in domestic prices in.in light of that statement and other portions of the commission opinion,the trial court ruled that although the commission did not explicitly state that earlier imports were not causing present material injury,it was reasonable to infer that the commission so concluded.in particular,the trial court rested its conclusion with respect to that issue on what it referred to as the commission continued discussion of the effects that subject imports entered earlier in the period of investigation had on the domestic industry and its ultimate conclusion that the domestic industry was not suffering present material injury.
we concur in the trial court analysis.the commission may not have stated explicitly that earlier imports were not causing material injury,but that conclusion was implicit in its analysis.the clear implication of the commission findings on that issue is that the prices fixed by contracts that were negotiated earlier in the investigation period may have suppressed the overall average price of domestic products throughout the period,but in light of the decrease in the current volume of imports and the increase in domestic prices in,the effect of those past imports was not significant.we therefore uphold the trial court decision with regard to the adequacy of the commission treatment of the subject imports from early in the investigation period.
nucor argues that the commission failed to make the statutorily required determination regarding the effect of underselling of domestic products by importers.the statute requires that in considering the effect of imports on prices,
the commission shall consider whether 
i there has been significant price underselling by the imported merchandise as compared with the price of domestic like products of the united states,and 
ii the effect of imports of such merchandise otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases,which otherwise would have occurred,to a significant degree.
c ii.nucor argues that in analyzing underselling by the subject imports,the commission failed to satisfy its statutory obligation to analyze underselling and price suppression separately.
the trial court held that the commission had complied with the requirements of section c ii.as the court noted,the commission compared underselling margins in with underselling margins in,and it found that most of the underselling occurred earlier in the period examined,prior to the imposition of section relief.the court ruled tha
