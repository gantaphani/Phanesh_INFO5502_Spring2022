four japanese ball bearing manufacturers and their united states affiliates collectively,the manufacturers challenge various aspects of the department of commerce commerce th review under commerce antidumping order covering certain ball bearings and parts thereof imported into the united states from six countries,including japan.see antifriction bearings other than tapered roller bearings and parts thereof from the federal republic of germany final results of antidumping administrative reviews.dep t of commerce july,first review.the challenged review set antidumping duties for the manufacturers on their imports during a period in.see ball bearings and parts thereof from france,germany,italy,japan,singapore,and the united kingdom final results of antidumping duty administrative reviews.dep t of commerce,final results.
this court recently rejected two of the manufacturers principal contentions raised in another challenge to the review by other ball bearing manufacturers.skf usa,united states.that decision is dispositive of the two contentions here.the manufacturers remaining contentions are unpersuasive.we therefore affirm the court of international trade judgment upholding the final results of the review.see koyo seiko united states,d.int l trade.
in determining the existence and amount of dumping,selling at a price below fair value in its annual review for a particular year under,commerce compares the united states price of the dumped merchandise with the price of comparable merchandise in the exporter or producer home country,or a country the comparison market.commerce first attempts to match sales of the dumped merchandise with sales of identical merchandise in the comparison market.a.where there is no identical merchandise,commerce attempts to match a sale in the united states with a sale of foreign like product in the comparison market.id.b c.under the statute,commerce determines what merchandise is similar.id.c iii.if there are no foreign sales of similar merchandise,commerce calculates a constructed value.id.a.
the process by which commerce identifies foreign like product in determining dumping margins for ball bearings is called.
in its first review,commerce adopted a family methodology for determining comparable foreign products for ball bearings.under that methodology,commerce compared imported bearings to bearings based upon eight different physical criteria.foreign bearings that matched the dumped bearings under those eight criteria were grouped into the same family of foreign like product.commerce then calculated the price of the foreign like product primarily by weight averaging the prices of all matching foreign products sold.when the process produced no matches,commerce constructed a value for the foreign price.
after announcing in the review that it intended to revise its methodology,commerce in its review abandoned the family methodology and adopted a process under which it compared the dumped merchandise to a single matching foreign product.
in the first step,commerce matched an import to products in the comparison market based upon four of the eight physical characteristics it previously had used.in the second step,commerce selected from among the matches in the first step the single product that best matched the dumped product based on a comparison with the four other characteristics.as part of the second step,commerce excluded foreign products that deviated from the dumped products by more than percent in their physical measurements.the new process results in more individual matches than the old process,and thus commerce did not have to use constructed prices as often as it did under the family approach.
in the review congress also continued to use the practice known as zeroing,which deals with the situation where the united states price of the allegedly dumped merchandise is higher than the price charged in the comparison market.there the antidumping duty will be negative.under zeroing,commerce sets the antidumping margin at zero.the effect is that the negative margins do not offset positive margins.see nsk united states.
in january,more than a year after commerce decided the review,the world trade organization appellate body and dispute settlement body wto held zeroing to be inconsistent with wto antidumping agreements.appellate body report,united relating to zeroing and sunset reviews,r.the united states announced its intention to implement the recommendations of the wto by december.see may.
in a lengthy and detailed opinion,the court of international trade affirmed commerce final results.the court held that both commerce new model match methodology and its practice of zeroing negative dumping margins were supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law,d at.the court also rejected the manufacturers other challenges to commerce final results,which we discuss in part iii below.
we review the court of international trade decisions regarding commerce antidumping determinations de novo,applying the same standard of review to commerce antidumping determinations as did that court.skf,at citing carpenter tech.united states,citations omitted.thus,we must sustain commerce determinations unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.quoting b b i.
a.in skf,another group of foreign ball bearing manufacturers challenged the final results that are here under review.in its opinion there,issued ten days before we heard oral argument in this case,this court sustained both commerce new matching methodology and its use of zeroing in determining dumping margins in the review.
the court ruled that commerce new methodology not only reflects a reasonable interpretation of the statute but also comports with our precedent.skf,at.it stated in this case,commerce provided adequate explanation of the reasonable compelling reasons motivating its determination.id.at.the court rejected the manufacturers contention that commerce had erred in applying the modified methodology retroactively.id.at.it quoted with apparent approval the court of international trade statement in koyo seiko,d at,that c hanges in methodology,like all other antidumping review determinations,permissibly involve retroactive effect.id.at.
the court rejected as unpersuasive the manufacturers challenges to commerce zeroing practice because they fail ed to raise any argument not fully resolved by our established precedent.id.at.it quoted statements from several of this court opinions upholding the practice,and concluded that we need not revisit this issue today.id.
this court decision in skf is controlling on the substance of those two issues and requires us to affirm commerce new methodology and its use of zeroing here.
b.the manufacturers urge us to remand this case to commerce to reconsider its final results in the th review in light of the wto ruling on zeroing and the united states announced intention to comply therewith.we decline to do so.
it is doubtful that in skf this court rejected such a remand.in their briefs there,the appellants,although challenging commerce use of zeroing,did not ask for a remand.the skf opinion does not discuss the point.in concluding that the appellants there had not raised any argument not fully resolved by our established precedent,at,it quoted the following statement from corus staal bv department of commerce,we will not attempt to perform duties that fall within the exclusive province of the political branches,and we therefore refuse to overturn commerce zeroing practice based on any ruling by the wto or other international body unless and until such ruling has been adopted pursuant to the specified statutory scheme.this statement is too slim a reed upon which to conclude that skf definitively rejected such a remand.thus,skf is not controlling precedent on this issue.
our recent decision in nsk united states,however,calls for denial of remand here.in that case,three of the manufacturers in their attack on the administrative review had challenged the practice of zeroing.there,too,the wto had issued its decision,and the united states had stated its intention to compl
