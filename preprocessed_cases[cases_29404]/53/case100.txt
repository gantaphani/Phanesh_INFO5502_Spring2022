myriad group appeals the district court partial denial of its motion to compel arbitration.myriad maintains that incorporation of the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral arbitration rules into an arbitration provision in a commercial contract constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties to the contract intended to delegate questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator.we agree,consistent with the other circuits to have considered the question.we therefore reverse the district court partial denial of myriad motion to compel arbitration.
background 
myriad is a swiss mobile software company.oracle america,is a delaware corporation that developed java,a computer programming language,and the java runtime environment.the java runtime environment facilitates computing compatibility.
oracle has a community licensing program that allows access to the java programming language and use of java trademarks in exchange for royalties.myriad entered into a community source license in.the source license encompasses several separate licenses,including the technology compatibility kits tck license.the tck license allows a licensee to access oracle testing protocols it is intended to ensure compatibility of the licensee products.a licensee right to use java trademarks is contingent upon the licensee product meeting applicable testing protocols.
myriad maintains that a separate agreement,the java specification participation agreement jspa,gave it rights to the java language and the testing protocols without payment of royalties.oracle maintains that,based on myriad faulty interpretation of the jspa,myriad stopped paying royalties and breached the source license.oracle also alleges that myriad failed to renew a separate agreement,the master support agreement,which was a prerequisite to a valid tck license,and that myriad continued use of the java trademarks and the java programming language infringed upon oracle intellectual property rights.
oracle filed suit in the northern district of california asserting claims for breach of contract,violation of the lanham act a,copyright infringement et,and unfair competition under california law cal.bus.et.myriad sued oracle separately in the district of delaware asserting that oracle breached the jspa.
myriad moved in the northern district of california to compel arbitration based on an arbitration clause in the source license.the arbitration clause provides 
any dispute arising out of or relating to this license shall be finally settled by arbitration as set out herein,except that either party may bring any action,in a court of competent jurisdiction which jurisdiction shall be exclusive,with respect to any dispute relating to such party intellectual property rights or with respect to your compliance with the tck license.arbitration shall be administered i by the american arbitration association aaa,ii in accordance with the rules of the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral the rules in effect at the time of arbitration as modified herein and iii the arbitrator will apply the substantive laws of california and united states.judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction to enforce such award.
myriad submitted a demand for arbitration with the arbitrator on august.approximately two weeks later,the district court granted myriad motion to compel arbitration with respect to oracle breach of contract claim but denied myriad motion with respect to all other claims.the district court concluded that incorporation of the uncitral arbitration rules did not constitute clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended to delegate questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator.the district court reasoned that the relevant provision of the uncitral rules states only that the arbitrator has authority,but not exclusive authority,to decide its own jurisdiction.
in january,the district court enjoined myriad from proceeding with arbitration of its claims.in deciding oracle motion for preliminary injunction,the district court clarified that it had not ruled that it had concurrent jurisdiction with the arbitrator over questions of arbitrability.rather,because the arbitration clause states that the court jurisdiction is exclusive with respect to a party intellectual property claims or claims arising out of the tck license,the court determined that the parties intended for the court to decide questions of arbitrability.
myriad appeals the district court order partially denying its motion to compel arbitration.the parties stipulated to a stay of the district court proceedings pending the outcome of this appeal.

iii.discussion 
the only issue in this case is whether the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.there is generally a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr.in accordance with that policy,doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.id.at.but the dispute in this case centers on who decides whether a claim is arbitrable.
just as the arbitrability of the merits of a dispute depends upon whether the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute,so the question who has the primary power to decide arbitrability turns upon what the parties agreed about that matter.first options of,kaplan,internal citations omitted.but,unlike the arbitrability of claims in general,whether the court or the arbitrator decides arbitrability is an issue for judicial determination unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.howsam dean witter reynolds,emphasis added alteration omitted quoting at t,commc ns workers.in other words,there is a presumption that courts will decide which issues are arbitrable the federal policy in favor of arbitration does not extend to deciding questions of arbitrability.
whether incorporation of the uncitral arbitration rules clearly and unmistakably delegates arbitrability to the arbitrator 
as a preliminary matter,the parties disagree about which version of the uncitral arbitration rules controls.their agreement refers to the uncitral rules in effect at the time of arbitration as modified herein.the uncitral rules were in effect at the time myriad submitted its demand for arbitration,and some of oracle arguments hinge on application of the rules.but myriad represents that the parties at one point agreed that the uncitral rules govern.we conclude that it is ultimately unnecessary to decide which version of the uncitral rules applies.
the uncitral arbitration rules provide that t he arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on objections that it has no jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration clause or of the separate arbitration agreement.uncitral arbitration rules,para,res,doc.the uncitral rules state that t he arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on its own jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.uncitral arbitration rules,para,res,doc.
by giving the arbitral tribunal the authority to decide its own jurisdiction,both the and uncitral rules vest the arbitrator with the apparent authority to decide questions of arbitrability.the only difference is that,under the rules,the authority of the arbitral tribunal is described as ruling on objections to its jurisdiction and under the rules the tribunal has the authority to decide its jurisdiction.the rules are more narrowly phrased than the rules,but there is not a significant distinction between how these sets of rules treat questions of arbitrability.we conclude it is immaterial which version of the uncitral rules is applied to the question presented by this appeal.
the parties central dispute is whether incorporation of the uncitral rules into the parties arbitration provision constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended to arbitrate arbitrability.this is an issue of
