samco global arms,samco,a arms dealer,appeals the dismissal without prejudice of its complaint for breach of contract against carlos arita,in his official capacity as the procurador general of honduras the procuradur√≠a general of honduras,an agency or instrumentality of the republic of honduras,and the republic of honduras collectively honduras the district court found that the defendants were immune from suit under the foreign sovereign immunities act of fsia,et,and that the case was also barred by the act of state doctrine.prior to dismissal,the district court denied samco requests for jurisdictional discovery and for an evidentiary hearing on the jurisdictional question.this appeal followed.we affirm because the fsia precludes suit against honduras under the allegations of this complaint.
the fsia provides the basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign in the united states.see a,b however,grants to foreign sovereigns immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states,with certain exceptions.section a,the exception relevant to this case,states 
a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.
emphasis added.if a foreign state is immune under the fsia,courts of the united states lack both subject matter and personal jurisdiction in any suit against it.republic of argentina weltover,d.
samco argues that honduras is not immune under the fsia because its cause of action against honduras is based upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.a.to assess this claim,we turn to the facts alleged in the complaint 
the complaint alleges a breach of contract by honduras.the contract referenced in the complaint and attached as an exhibit upon which this action is based was entered into by and longlac enterprises corporation longlac,a panamanian corporation.the contract provided that longlac would be permitted to import into honduras an inventory of weapons,munitions,and explosives free of taxes and other fees.the weapons would be stored and safeguarded by the honduran armed forces in a military facility.in return,honduras enjoyed the right of first refusal to purchase part or all of the inventory from longlac.arms not purchased by honduras could be retrieved,sold and exported to countries by longlac.if purchases were made by the honduran armed forces,they would be governed by separate purchase and sale agreements to be negotiated by the parties.between,when longlac delivered the inventory of arms to honduras,and,the arms were either purchased by the honduran armed forces or by longlac for outside sale.during that time,longlac allegedly sold some of the inventory to samco,in miami,florida.
following a turnover in power in honduras in,the contracting parties relationship deteriorated.domestic criminal charges were brought against the honduran armed forces asserting illegal trafficking with regard to the arms owned by longlac.the honduran criminal court ultimately found no criminal misconduct and issued a ruling on february,returning control of the arms to their rightful owner.however,an attorney lien was subsequently imposed by the honduran courts on the arms in june of.the lien,which amounts to approximately of the worth of the arms,was obtained by longlac attorney for unpaid fees earned in connection with the criminal action and related services.the complaint alleges that in may of,after nearly two years of failed attempts by longlac to recover the arms,longlac sold all of its rights and claims under the contract to samco.a letter referencing the assignment is attached to the complaint,and states that longlac is 
hereby confirming and accepting we have closed the sale of all our inventories in honduras deposited with the armed forces under contract of bailment signed on july,to samco all the rights derived from this contract must be observed by the original subscribers,accepting the purchaser all the obligations derived from the contract 
from this date,while a new general power of attorney is granted,it is established that once i communicate the sale in a legal way to the army force,samco can be able to subscribe contracts and obligations of any nature in relation to the equipment,munitions and materials described in the contract dated july.
letter of may,at ex.thus,accepting the allegations of the complaint as true,samco now stands in the shoes of longlac.
in its complaint,samco asserts that the attachment of the arms during the pendency of the criminal charges against the armed forces and the imposition of an attorney lien by the honduran courts as well as alleged damage to the arms while in storage during this time constituted a breach of the contract by the government of honduras.accordingly,samco seeks redress for this alleged breach of the contract,arguing that honduras is not immune under the fsia because,as noted earlier,its cause of action against honduras is based upon the exception contained in a.
to determine whether a permits this suit against the honduran government,we must determine whether the act of the foreign government outside the territory of the united states was an act in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state and constituted an act that causes a direct effect in the united states.a.
we readily conclude that the contract constituted a commercial activity under the fsia.this circuit has held that where the activity at issue involves a government contract for purchase and sale of goods,the activity is commercial,and not sovereign.see s davis int l,republic of yemen,cir see also vermeulen renault,usa,cir the sale of merchandise is a quintessential commercial activity.in designing and manufacturing cars for sale,the sovereign defendant acted not in any governmental capacity,but in the manner of a private player,no different from general motors,ford,or any other privately owned automobile manufacturer practical concepts,republic of bolivia,a contract between a foreign state and a private party for the purchase of goods or services may presumptively be,but is not inevitably,commercial activity.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
this contract was essentially for the bailment of goods with a purchase option it was predominantly commercial in nature,and obviously could have been executed by individuals in the private marketplace.the mere fact that the military was involved in the storage and purchase of arms does not alone convert the activity into an exercise of sovereign power.see weltover,at.noting that the fact that a government issued bonds did not convert the private nature of the activity a contract to buy army boots or even bullets is a commercial activity,because private companies can similarly use sales contracts to acquire goods 
notwithstanding the fact that the parties entered into a commercial contract,the district court held that the government actions which allegedly constituted a breach of that contract were not acts in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state.the district court reasoned that the criminal court seizure of the goods pending a criminal investigation or administrative proceeding and the attachment of the property to enforce an attorney lien were acts that could only be undertaken by a sovereign,and not by private parties.
we need not reach the question of whether,under the facts presented,the actions of the honduran criminal courts and the imposition of an attorney lien constitute acts in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state,because,in any event,these acts have not caused
