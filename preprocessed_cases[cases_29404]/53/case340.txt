the question presented in this appeal is whether the department of commerce commerce reasonably interpreted ambiguous language in c a.this language allows a reduction in the price of imported merchandise for united states import duties before that domestic price is compared against the foreign price in an antidumping analysis.the court finds commerce interpretation reasonable because it accords with the statutory language and accurately reflects the overall duty costs to importers.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the court of international trade.
background 
proceedings before the department of commerce.
appellants are four orange juice producers,florida citrus mutual,duda sons,citrus world,and southern gardens citrus processing,collectively referred to as fcm.appellees are brazilian orange juice producers citrosuco paulista fischer fischer,and citrus products,and sucocitrico cutrale sa cutrale.
on december,fcm filed an antidumping petition with the department of commerce and the international trade commission itc,alleging that sales of two types of frozen orange juice from brazil were materially injuring the domestic industry.on february,commerce launched an investigation.it selected fischer,cutrale,and montecitrus industria e comercio limitada montecitrus the three largest brazilian orange juice mandatory respondents in the investigation.on march,commerce distributed the standard antidumping duty questionnaire to the brazilian companies.section c of the questionnaire asked the respondents to report the unit amount of any customs duty paid on the subject merchandise.fischer and cutrale reported figures for import duties that included refunds the companies had received as part of drawback programs.these drawback programs allow foreign companies to receive refunds of duties paid on merchandise that is exported,or destroyed,within three years of entry into the united states.over fcm objection,commerce calculated the constructed export price using net import duties,which were the duties paid to customs minus the drawback refunds as reported by fischer and cutrale.fischer and cutrale argued that the drawback refunds should be used to offset duties paid as that amount more accurately reflected the actual duties paid by the companies on the imported orange juice.
whether fischer and cutrale were entitled to the proposed offset for drawback refunds was an issue of first impression for commerce.commerce performed an antidumping export price or constructed export price in the united states to the normal value in the foreign market in its final determination,commerce concluded that the applicable statute,c a,allowed the offset for drawback refunds.it therefore calculated a constructed export price for fischer and cutrale by reducing the price of the orange juice by the net duties paid.in its issues and decision memorandum,commerce explained that calculating net import duties would encompass the net duty experience of the respondents.commerce further reasoned that the calculation of net import duties was consistent with the statutory mandate to reduce price by all movement expenses incident to importing the goods into the united states.it concluded that allowing the offset for drawback refunds provided a fair comparison to normal value of the orange juice in the brazilian market.
on february,fcm filed a ministerial error allegation,which asserted that commerce had erred in calculating dumping margins for cutrale and fischer in its final determination.on february,commerce published an amended final determination,in which it corrected various ministerial errors and made minor adjustments to its original calculations,but rejected fcm challenge to its price calculation methodology.on march,commerce published its antidumping order as antidumping duty order certain orange juice from brazil.dep t of commerce.

commerce decision to account for drawback refunds was reasonable.
the drawback program permits importers to claim reimbursement of percent of duties paid on imports when commercially interchangeable merchandise is either exported from the united states,or destroyed within three years of the date of importation.a see generally.the code of federal regulations defines drawback as the refund or remission,in whole or in part,of a customs duty,fee or internal revenue tax which was imposed on imported merchandise under federal law because of its importation.i.thus,drawbacks allow import duties,which are levied on goods imported into the united states for sale,to be refunded when substituted goods are exported,destroyed,or used in manufacturing instead of being sold in the united states.as a practical matter,customs and border protection receives a deposit of the duties due from the importer,which is later adjusted if the importer exercises its drawback rights in a timely fashion.
fischer and cutrale claimed and received drawback refunds under two statutory provisions b and j.cutrale claimed refunds under section j,which allows a substitution drawback.under this provision,an importer may receive duty refunds if it then exports from the united states commercially interchangeable merc
