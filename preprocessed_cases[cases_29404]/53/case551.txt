this case presents important questions concerning the interpretation of the amendments to the tariff act of act,codified in the united states code in chapter of title.we conclude that the amendments are ambiguous as to the scope of the indirect selling expenses to be deducted under d d because we also conclude that the department of commerce interpretation of that provision is reasonable,we defer to that interpretation under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.finally,we conclude that the plain text of the amended statute requires the department of commerce commerce to deduct the selling expenses enumerated in d from the starting price of constructed export price sales before making a level of trade comparison under a a.accordingly,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
statutory background 
resolution of this appeal requires an understanding of the antidumping statute,which was significantly amended by the uruguay round agreements act,pub,stat.uraa.the uraa applies to administrative reviews initiated after january,and therefore governs this appeal.torrington united states.
under the current antidumping statute,commerce is required to impose antidumping duties on imported merchandise that is being sold,or is likely to be sold,in the united states at less than fair value to the detriment of a domestic industry.the purpose underlying the antidumping laws is to prevent foreign manufacturers from injuring domestic industries by selling their products in the united states at less than fair value,at prices below the prices the foreign manufacturers charge for the same products in their home markets.torrington,at.the amount of the duty to be imposed,otherwise known as the dumping margin,is the amount by which the price charged for the subject merchandise in the home market the normal value exceeds the price charged in the united states the price,a.the price is calculated by using one of two price ep or constructed export price cep.a b.
in order to make a fair comparison,certain adjustments must be made to the price and the normal value.such adjustments are made in order to reconstruct the price at a specific,common point in the chain of commerce,so that value can be fairly compared on an equivalent basis.koyo seiko united states,quoting group united states.
the two adjustments involved here are directed to the problem posed by sales to affiliated entities.when an exporter makes a sale to an affiliated example,a wholly or partly owned price is necessarily suspect.the risk is that an artificially low price may be charged to the affiliated distributor in the home market and an artificially high price charged to the affiliated distributor in the united states market.the consequence in each case is that a lower countervailing duty or no duty at all would be payable.
constructed export price deductions under d 
when the foreign producer or exporter sells directly to an unaffiliated purchaser in the united states,commerce uses ep as the price for purposes of the comparison.a.however,where a sale is made by a foreign producer or exporter to an affiliated purchaser in the united states,the statute provides for use of cep as the united states price for purposes of the comparison.b.all of the sales at issue in this appeal are cep sales.
to determine the price for both ep and cep sales,commerce starts with the first sale price to an unaffiliated purchaser starting price and makes certain upward and downward adjustments enumerated in c.further,in subsection d the statute sets forth specific bases for additional deductions which apply only to cep sales.of particular relevance here are the deductions of subsection d,which provides 
t he price used to establish constructed export price shall also be reduced by 
the amount of any of the following expenses generally incurred by or for the account of the producer or exporter,or the affiliated seller in the united states,in selling the subject merchandise or subject merchandise to which value has been added 
a commissions for selling the subject merchandise in the united states 
b expenses that result from,and bear a direct relationship to,the sale,such as credit expenses,guarantees and warranties 
c any selling expenses that the seller pays on behalf of the purchaser and 
d any selling expenses not deducted under subparagraph a,b,or c.
d emphasis added.the first issue in this case involves the subsection d d deductions.
here the parties differ over the class of expenses included within subsection d d.under commerce theory,the objective of the subsection d d deductions is to adjust the price of the first sale by the affiliate to an unaffiliated purchaser so that it corresponds as closely as possible to the ep,so that cep and ep reflect the same level of trade,and comparable comparisons using either ep or cep can be made to normal value.as stated in commerce regulation which formalized the methodology at issue here 
in establishing constructed export price under section d of the act d,the secretary of commerce will make adjustments for expenses associated with commercial activities in the united states that relate to the sale to an unaffiliated purchaser,no matter where or when paid.
b as commerce stated in its preamble to this regulation,the expenses at issue are those expenses incurred between importation and resale but not expenses.antidumping duties countervailing duties final rule,fed.reg,may,preamble.see also color picture tubes from japan,fed.reg,june,final admin.review.thus,in commerce view general selling expenses,such as inventory costs,applicable to sales generally and not specifically related to united states sales to an unaffiliated purchasers should not be deducted.
on the other hand,appellant micron technology,micron urges on this appeal that the provision,on its face,provides for the deduction of any indirect selling expenses,and that commerce deductions were too limited.micron contends that the statute obligates commerce to deduct not only those expenses specifically associated with the sale to the unaffiliated customer in the united states,but also that portion of the indirect selling expenses incurred abroad that is allocable to united states sales.
level of trade adjustment 
the statute further requires commerce to establish normal value to the extent practicable,at the same level of trade as the export price or constructed export price.a b i.neither the statute nor the accompanying statement of administrative action saa,doc,sess,reprinted in defines the phrase same level of trade.however,we understand the term to mean comparable marketing stages in the home and united states markets,a comparison of wholesale sales in korea to wholesale sales in the united states.see c the secretary will determine that sales are made at different levels of trade if they are made at different marketing stages or their equivalent.this provision ensures,for example,that a normal value wholesale price will not be compared to a united states cep retail price.
when commerce is unable to find sales in the foreign market at the same level of trade as the sales in the united states,it will compare sales in the united states and foreign markets at a different level of trade.in such cases,the antidumping statute requires commerce to increase or decrease the normal value to account for the difference in the level of trade,if that difference 
i involves the performance of different selling activities and 
ii is demonstrated to affect price comparability,based on a pattern of consistent price differences between sales at different levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.
a a see also.
in some instances,the level of trade in the home market will constitute a more advanced stage of distribution than the level of trade in the united states,yet commerce will lack sufficient data regarding the sales in the two markets to make a level of trade adjustment,that is,it will be unable to determine how much to reduce the foreign sale price to arrive at a price comparable to the price.in those cases,the statute provides for the award of a constructed export price offset cep offset,a reduction in normal value equal to the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the country in which normal value is determined on sales of the foreign like product a b.the effect is to reduce the price of the more advanced level of trade by indirect selling expenses that have been included in the price on the apparent theory that such costs would not have been incurred if the sale had been made on a less advanced level of trade.however,the cep offset may not exceed the amount of such expenses for which a deduction is made under section d d.id.
here the parties disagree over whether the amended statute requires commerce to deduct the selling expenses enumerated in d from cep before making the level of trade comparison.according to commerce,t he statute directs the department to determine normal value at the lot level of trade of the cep,which includes any cep deductions under section d.preamble,fed.reg.at.commerce has formalized this interpretation of the statute in a regulation which provides,in pertinent part,that t he secretary of commerce will identify the level of trade based on i n the case of constructed export price,the starting price,as adjusted under section d of the act.c.appellant micron argues that the statute does not authorize commerce to deduct the selling expenses at issue before making the level of trade comparison,and that commerce methodology is not in accordance with law.
factual background 
this particular case involves the determination of dumping margins for imports of dynamic random access memory semiconductors drams from the republic of korea korea by lg semicon,and its united states subsidiary,lg semicon america,collectively,lg semicon.
appellant micron,a united states manufacturer of drams,petitioned commerce on april,for an antidumping investigation to determine whether korean producers of drams were selling the subject merchandise in the united states at less than fair value.
following its antidumping investigation,commerce made an affirmative determination of sales at less than fair value and accordingly published an antidumping order on drams from korea in may.antidumping duty order and amended final determination dynamic random access memory semiconductors of one megabit and above from the republic of korea,fed.reg.may.at the request of micron and three respondents including lg semicon,commerce initiated an administrative review of the antidumping order on june,covering the period of review from may,through april.initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews,fed.reg.june,as part of this administrative review,commerce obtained from lg semicon data regarding the companies direct and indirect selling expenses incurred in the united states and korea.

constructed export price deductions under d d 
the first issue issue involves commerce interpretation of d d,which,as noted above,mandates that the price used to establish constructed export price shall also be reduced by any selling expenses not deducted under the other subdivisions of subsection d.in computing the price for the subject merchandise,commerce interpreted this provision to exclude from the deductions indirect selling expenses incurred by lg semicon in korea that were not directly related to sales to an unaffiliated purchaser in the united states unfortunately,the parties to this appeal have provided us with only the sketchiest description of the types of indirect selling expenses at issue.they are said to be the rents on lg semicon sales offices incurred in korea,the salaries for lg semicon salesmen incurred in korea,and certain inventory carrying costs.
in deciding not to deduct these indirect selling expenses from the price,commerce reasoned that the indirect selling expenses at issue did not result from or bear relationship to selling activities in the united states,and accordingly it declined to deduct them.final results,fed.reg.at 
micron appealed this determination to the court of international trade,arguing that the plain text of section d d of the statute mandated that all selling expenses be deducted from the starting price.the court disagreed,noting that the statute did not define the scope of the indirect selling expenses to be deducted under d d.micron,united states,d,cit.because the statute is silent,the court examined commerce interpretation of the statute and found it to be reasonable and thus entitled to chevron deference.id.at.
level of trade adjustment 
the second issue issue involves commerce methodology used to conduct the level of trade analysis to assess the level of trade,commerce first adjusted the starting price by deducting the indirect selling expenses identified above,including the deductions set forth in d d,to arrive at the price.commerce then compared the sales to the sales in korea the home market and concluded that lg semicon sales in korea were at a more advanced level of trade than the sales in the united states.because there was no basis upon which to determine what price differences existed between these two levels of trade,commerce allowed lg semicon a constructed export price offset pursuant to a b.final results,fed.reg.at.
micron also appealed this determination to the court of international trade.on that appeal,micron argued that the statute did not authorize commerce to deduct the selling expenses enumerated in d from the starting price of lg semicon cep sales before making the level of trade comparison.the court agreed with micron and held that commerce methodology contravened the statute.in reaching this decision,the court relied on its earlier decision in borden,united states,d,appeal docketed,wl.in borden,the court found that commerce level of trade methodology in cep cases does not comport reasonably with the current statutory scheme.id.at.although the court reasoning in borden was not entirely clear,it appears that the court determined that the plain text of the statute makes no mention of d type adjustments prior to the lot level of trade analysis.id.the court appears to have also found that commerce deduction of the selling expenses set forth in d before making the level of trade analysis automatically resulted in level of trade adjustments in every cep case,contrary to congressional intent.the court concluded that the statute leaves no room for commerce ostensible discretion to for selling expenses in the united states through the automatic deduction of d selling expenses,and accordingly it rejected commerce methodology.id.

constructed export price deductions under d 
before this court,micron argues that the plain text of d,the saa,the legislative history of the statute,and the statute purpose require the deduction from the starting price of all selling expenses related to cep sales.
the language of the statute 
micron urges that the statutory language itself requires the deduction of all selling expenses.as noted above,subsection d provides for the deduction of any selling expenses not deducted under subparagraph a,b,or c.d emphasis added.micron and amici point us to cases holding that the term any necessarily means all.see united states rosenwasser.the use of the words each and any to modify employee leaves no doubt as to the congressional intention to include all employees within the scope of the fair labor standards act unless specifically excluded.barseback kraft ab united states,the word any is generally used in the sense of all or every and its meaning is most comprehensive.
while we agree that the word any necessarily includes all,the real question here is all of what we conclude that the description of the what in the statute is ambiguous,as the statute does not define the selling expenses within subsection d.we reach this conclusion for several reasons.application of the interpretive rule of ejusdem generis to d suggests that congress intended subsection d to encompass the same types of expenses as are included in subsections a,b and 
as this court has previously stated 
under the rule of ejusdem generis,which means of the same kind,where an enumeration of specific things is followed by a general word or phrase,the general word or phrase is held to refer to things of the same kind as those specified.
sports graphics,united states,italics in original see generally norman singer,statutes and statutory construction,at ed.where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration,the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.
the plain text of the statute and the accompanying saa make it clear that the three types of expenses enumerated in d a c are limited to expenses incurred specifically with respect to sales to unaffiliated purchasers in the united states only those commissions for selling the subject merchandise in the united states are deductible under subsection a see also saa at stating that commissions are deductible only to the extent that they are incurred in the united states on sales of the subject merchandise,reprinted in.subsection b sets forth a list of direct selling expenses,which the saa defines as expenses which result from and bear a direct relationship to the particular sale in question.saa at,reprinted in.the saa further provides that such expenses may be deducted from the constructed export price only to the extent they are incurred after importation.id.finally,the expenses assumed by the seller on behalf of the purchaser may be deducted under subsection c in the same manner as the direct selling expenses,only if the expenses bear a direct relationship to the sale to the unaffiliated purchaser in the united states.saa at,reprinted in.
in short,the only expenses deductible under the first three subsections of d are those expenses arising specifically out of the sale of the subject merchandise in the united states to an unaffiliated purchaser,as opposed to those general expenses incurred by the foreign producer or exporter in all sales,without regard to the identity or location of the purchaser.subsection d,in turn,is a general provision which merely provides for the deduction of any selling expenses not deducted under subparagraph a,b,or c.under these circumstances,subsection d was at least ambiguous,and it was reasonable for commerce to interpret subsection d as encompassing the same types of expenses as those enumerated in the previous subsections.
the plain text of f also supports commerce reading of the statute.subsection f,a new provision regarding profit adjustment for cep sales,effectively provides for the deduction of profit on united states expenses,which are defined to be the total expenses described in subsections d and d of this section.f b.by describing the expenses to be deducted under d as united states expenses,subsection f assumes that the expenses at issue are indeed those expenses arising specifically out of the sale of the subject merchandise in the united states.even more to the point,the saa instructs that this profit deduction applies only to profits allocable to selling,distribution and further manufacturing activities in the united states.saa at,reprinted in.we agree with commerce that this subsection thus suggests that the coverage of section d d is limited to those expenses incurred in connection with a sale in the united states.preamble,fed.reg.at.
the saa and the legislative history 
micron next argues that in enacting the uraa,congress did not intend to alter the provisions governing the deduction of selling expenses in the previous law.micron asserts that the saa,which purported to identify all changes in the statutory approach following the enactment of the uraa,saa at,reprinted in,did not mention any change with respect to selling expenses.the saa,of course,is more than mere legislative history.congress has instructed that t he statement of administrative action approved by the congress under a shall be regarded as an authoritative expression by the united states concerning the interpretation and application of the uruguay round agreements and this act in any judicial proceeding in which a question arises concerning such interpretation or application.d.
micron also relies on house and senate reports on the uraa for the proposition that the amendments to the statute did not change the current law with respect to the deduction of indirect selling expenses.the house report,at,reprinted in,states that the amended statute retain s current law with respect to the deduction made for direct and indirect expenses the pertinent senate report states that 
a mended section d d d d provides,as under current law,for the deduction of indirect selling expenses.the committee intends that this category will,as under current practice,encompass those expenses that do not result from,or can not be tied directly to specific sales,but that may reasonably be attributed to such sales.
micron further argues that the provision of the statute corresponding to current subsection d was interpreted by the department of commerce to require the deduction of all indirect selling expenses,and that the court of international trade reached a similar conclusion in silver reed america united states.micron contends that congress should be assumed to have been aware of silver reed and commerce interpretation when it enacted the uraa and that,under such circumstances,we should assume that silver reed and commerce corresponding interpretation were incorporated into the amended antidumping statute.thus,micron contends,commerce current interpretation contravenes the amended statute.
micron argument has considerable force,but we are not convinced.
first,we do not read the saa to state that current law as to the expenses enumerated in d is not being changed.indeed,the saa suggests to the contrary.it lists the adjustments enumerated in a different c and states that t hese adjustments have not changed from current law.saa at,reprinted in.but then in the next paragraph it states 
additionally,under new section d d,constructed export price will be calculated by reducing the price of the first sale to an unaffiliated customer in the united states by the amount of the following expenses and profit associated with economic activities occurring in the united states the deduction of profit is a new adjustment in law,consistent with the language of the antidumping agreement,which reflects that constructed export price is now calculated to be,as closely as possible,a price corresponding to an export price between exporters and importers.
id.the fact that the profit deduction is a new adjustment in law hardly suggests that the d expense deductions,unlike the c adjustments,have not been changed.
second,even if we assume that congress did not intend to change the law with respect to the deduction of indirect selling expenses,there is no evidence that congress understood the law to be anything more than the earlier statutory provisions with respect to selling expenses.the statute,while explicit with respect to the deduction of certain selling expenses,was ambiguous as to what other selling expenses were to be deducted.it merely provided,in pertinent part,for the deduction of expenses generally incurred by or for the account of the exporter in the united states in selling identical or substantially identical merchandise.e.in short,the statute does not define the scope of indirect selling expenses to be deducted.therefore,congress at best determined to continue the existing ambiguity.
third,no claim is made that the silver reed decision was called to congress attention.micron urges that if congress a statute which has been judicially interpreted,then congress is presumed to have adopted the interpretation,citing merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,curran,d.however,micron has not demonstrated that congress was aware of the decision in silver reed when it amended the statute.we are unwilling to apply the presumption relied upon by micron when there is no evidence that congress attention was directed to the decision in silver reed when the statute was.
for example,in commissioner glenshaw glass,the supreme court held that money received by a taxpayer as exemplary damages for fraud or as punitive damages in a antitrust action was reportable gross income,under section a of the internal revenue code.the taxpayers pointed to a decision of the board of tax appeals which held punitive damages to be nontaxable,and argued that because congress had section a without change following the board decision,such indicates congressional satisfaction with that holding.the supreme court disagreed,stating that r without the slightest affirmative indication that congress ever had the board of tax appeals decision before an unreliable indicium at best.id.subsequent decisions of the supreme court have reaffirmed this prerequisite for the application of the presumption in short,at least without evidence of congress awareness of the decision in silver reed,we will not presume that congress adopted the court of international trade reasoning in that decision when it amended the antidumping statute.
fourth,no claim is made that the silver reed decision was a settled judicial interpretation of the statute.the decision of the court of international trade on this issue was hardly the last word regarding the interpretation of the antidumping statute.under these circumstances we would not assume that congress intended to adopt sub silentio the single decision of a trial court,even if it had been aware of the decision.in united states powell,d,for example,the supreme court declined to presume that congress had adopted the reasoning of four judicial decisions when it twice a provision of the internal revenue code.the court stated that t hese cases represent neither a settled judicial construction nor one which we should be justified in presuming congress,by its silence,impliedly approved.see also bragdon abbott,d stating that the presumption applies w hen administrative and judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision pierce underwood,d noting that congressional reenactment of statute that had in fact been given a consistent judicial interpretation generally includes the settled judicial interpretation.
finally,while commerce had interpreted the statute to provide for the deduction of indirect selling expenses related to sales in the united states,we do not assume that congress silently intended to adopt such an interpretation by the agency.again,this presumption of implicit congressional approval of an administrative interpretation requires that congress be aware of the existence of the agency interpretation micron has presented no evidence that congress,when it amended the antidumping statute,was aware of commerce interpretation of the pertinent provisions of the statute.
micron argues that the specific language of the senate and house committee reports refers to current practice and states that section d d will encompass those expenses that do not result from,or can not be tied directly to specific sales,but that may reasonably be attributed to such sales,at.this,says micron,makes clear that congress was not limiting the deductible expenses to those solely related to sales.
unfortunately for micron,the reports are ambiguous.the reference to current practice standing alone is unclear,and the senate report,for example,can be read as intended to ensure that it is not necessary to tie expenses to individual sales or not necessary to tie expenses to sales at all.those reports fall far short of demonstrating that congress was aware of commerce interpretation,or that it endorsed it.
any assumption that congress intended to freeze an administrative interpretation of a statute,which was unknown to congress,would be entirely contrary to the concept of assumes and approves the ability of administrative agencies to change their interpretation.as the supreme court noted,t he power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left,implicitly or explicitly,by congress.chevron,at.quoting morton ruiz,d.congress can not,and need not,draft a statute which anticipates and provides for all possible circumstances in which a general policy must be applied to a specific set of facts.it properly leaves this task to the authorized agency.commerce ability to alter its interpretation of the antidumping statute is particularly important because commerce is the acknowledged master of the antidumping laws,and its interpretations of the pertinent statutes are worthy of considerable deference.zenith elecs.united states,see also micron,united states,in antidumping cases,we acknowledge commerce special expertise and accord substantial deference to its construction of pertinent statutes.
congressional purpose 
micron next argues that the effect of commerce interpretation is to exclude from the scope of d d those expenses incurred outside of the united states,a result micron asserts is contrary to the intent of congress.
micron also argues that deducting all selling expenses serves the purposes of congress by preventing the false characterization of expenses by the overseas producer or exporter.micron urges that unless all indirect selling expenses are deducted,foreign competitors will deliberately shift certain expenses out of the united states to mask the extent of the dumping,thereby defeating the congressional purpose.
in fact,commerce has not imposed any geographic limitation on those expenses deductible under subsection for example,commerce regulation provides,in pertinent part,that commerce will make adjustments for expenses associated with commercial activities in the united states that relate to the sale to an unaffiliated purchaser,no matter where or when paid.b emphasis added.as commerce explained in the preamble accompanying that regulation 
t he phrase no matter where or when paid is intended to indicate that if commercial activities occur in the united states and relate to the sale to an unaffiliated purchaser,expenses associated with those activities will be deducted from cep even if,for example,the foreign parent of the affiliated importer pays those expenses.
