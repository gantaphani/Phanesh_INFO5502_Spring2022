horn company horn appeals the judgment of the court of international trade affirming the united states customs service customs classification of horn imports of dichloroethyl ether dcee under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus as an other ether of monohydric alcohol.horn united states,wl.int l trade.because the trial court properly interpreted the htsus and found that subheading more specifically covers horn imports of dcee,we affirm.
background 
horn produces and imports dcee,which has the chemical formula.dcee is an acyclic ether more particularly,it is a symmetrical acyclic ether because the groups attached to the oxygen atom are the same.to produce its dcee,horn employs a patented processing formula that does not involve deriving dcee from diethyl ether or a mono or polyhydric alcohol,either by dehydration or by any other method.
for a number of years,horn classified its imports of dcee under subheading,which applies to diethyl ethers.it did so because dcee is a structural derivative of diethyl ether,and subheading note to chapter of the htsus states that 
within any one heading of this chapter,derivatives of a chemical compound or group of chemical compounds are to be classified in the same subheading as that compound or group of compounds provided that they are not more specifically covered by any other subheading and that there is no residual subheading named other in the series of subheadings concerned.
subheading note,section vi,chapter,htsus emphasis on other in original,other emphasis added note.because it is a structural derivative of diethyl ether,horn classified its dcee as diethyl ether,subject to a one percent tariff rate under subheading.
in,the los angeles customs office conducted a laboratory test of horn dcee.the los angeles customs laboratory concluded that horn claimed dcee was in fact dcee.accordingly,the los angeles customs office continued to allow horn to import the chemical under subheading as a derivative of diethyl ether.
despite the findings of the los angeles customs laboratory,the customs office for the port of houston rejected horn entries of dcee under subheading and instead required classification under subheading,the provision for ethers of monohydric alcohols other than methyl ether mtbe.at that time,the relevant portion of the htsus read as follows 
the houston customs office classified horn dcee under subheading,subject to a duty rate of because it found that the subheading more specifically covered horn imports.
horn disagreed and filed a protest and application for further review on january.in response,customs issued headquarters ruling letter on april.it concluded that horn dcee should be classified under subheading as an other ether of monohydric alcohol.
horn appealed to the united states court of international trade claiming that dcee is not an ether of monohydric alcohol because it is not produced from monohydric alcohol and does not contain a monohydric alcohol in its structure.the court found the issue ripe for summary judgment because it depended upon interpretation of the tariff schedule rather than the physical characteristics of the imported merchandise.
applying the language of note,the court of international trade began by addressing the question of whether dcee is an ether of monohydric alcohol and therefore more specifically provided for under subheading.based on relevant chemical dictionary definitions,the explanatory notes to iv under explanatory notes,and the statutory structure,the court agreed with the government that an ether should be classified according to its structural relationship to a particular alcohol.the court of international trade further concluded that the process of dehydration defines that relationship and that the key structural aspect to evaluate is the correspondence of the carbon backbones.based on its interpretation of the tariff schedule,the court classified horn dcee as an other ether of monohydric alcohol under subheading.
because it found that subheading more specifically provided for dcee,the court of international trade did not address the other note dcee was covered by a residual other provision or was a derivative of diethyl ether.
horn timely appealed the court of international trade decision.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

on appeal,horn argues that,under note,its dcee must be classified under subheading.although it concedes that its dcee does not specifically belong under subheading because it is not diethyl ether,horn contends that neither of the note exceptions applies thus,its dcee should be classified as a derivative of diethyl ether.first,horn argues that its dcee is not more specifically provided for under subheading because it is not an ether of meaning made from either mono or polyhydric alcohol.alternatively,horn believes that if subheading covers structural derivatives,its dcee is not specifically covered under subheading because it lacks a shared backbone with any mono or polyhydric alcohols.finally,horn argues,there is no residual other provision in the same series of goods may be classified in the subheading other provision.thus,because neither of the note exceptions applies,horn concludes that its dcee should be classified as a derivative of diethyl ether.
the government counters that the court of international trade properly classified horn dcee imports under subheading.the government agrees with horn that,under note,subheading does not specifically provide for horn dcee.the agreement ends there,however,because the government believes that subheading both more specifically provides for dcee and also serves as a residual other provision.in either case,the government contends,note requires classification under,specifically.accordingly,the government concludes that horn dcee should not be classified as a derivative of diethyl ether.
we begin,as did the court of international trade,by determining the meaning of note,quoted above.note guides the classification process by stating that customs should classify derivatives of a chemical compound in the same subheading as the compound unless they are not more specifically covered by another subheading,or there is no residual subheading named other in the relevant series of subheadings.in this case,the parties do not contest that dcee is an ether,covered by htsus.the parties further agree that dcee is an acyclic ether,covered by either subheading or subheading.finally,they agree that dcee is not itself diethyl ether,which would be specifically covered by subheading.applying the note classification process to the facts at issue,we must therefore determine whether horn dcee is more specifically covered under subheading if not,whether there is a residual other subheading in the series of subheadings that would cover horn dcee and finally if not,whether horn dcee is a derivative of diethyl ether such that it should be classified under subheading.
in order to answer the first note dcee is more specifically covered under subheading divide the analysis into two parts.first,we will address the parties arguments regarding the overall organization of the subheadings covering acyclic ethers to determine whether the subheading potentially covers horn imports of dcee.as a legal matter,therefore,we must determine if subheading requires classification of ethers according to their structure or their method of manufacture.second,if subheading requires classification of ethers according to their structure,we will further evaluate whether any of the more specific,or classifies horn dcee.as to this latter question,we must determine the particular type of chemical structural relationships to evaluate.
with respect to the first structure of the relevant tariff contends that subheading requires classification according to method of manufacture.horn argues that its dcee is not an ether of monohydric alcohol because it is not made from monohydric alcohol.citing the declaration of the government expert witness james canary,horn notes that the word derivative can mean either that a compound was directly produced from another compound or that it has a chemical formula that is structurally related to that of another compound.based on the headings and note,horn argues in favor of adopting the broader,structurally related definition of derivative.the problem,according to horn,is that the court of international trade also used this definition to classify its dcee as an ether of monohydric alcohol.specifically,it contends that the use of the word of for subheadings under limits classification to ethers made from monohydric alcohol it believes that of does not encompass all structurally related compounds but is limited to those actually produced from monohydric alcohols.the plain meaning of the term of,argues horn,requires such a construction,in accordance with general principles of statutory construction.in addition,horn focuses on the tariff schedule use of disparate use of the word of in the various subheadings under as distinguished from the use of the word derivative in the heading for htsus and in note emphasize that congress intended a difference in meaning.finally,horn cites a variety of cases to support its construction of the term of.
in response,the government argues in favor of classifying all ethers according to their structure.in so doing,the government focuses on the organization of the tariff provisions to argue that of encompasses the broader definition of derivative,which covers structural relationships.as the government points out,the parties agree that dcee belongs under the heading acyclic ethers.moreover,the government notes,this heading itself contains two for diethyl ether and subheading for other.consequently,according to the government,the other provision must encompass all acyclic their structural than diethyl ether.
based on the language and organization of the tariff provisions,we agree with the government interpretation and hold that the htsus requires classification of compounds under subheading according to structure.we base our conclusion on the plain meaning and overall organization of the tariff schedule headings and subheadings,as well as the explanatory notes to the tariff schedule and various dictionary definitions of ether.
in accordance with gri,discussed above,we first focus on the language of the applicable heading.heading covers ethers,alcohol peroxides,ether peroxides,ketone peroxides whether or not chemically defined,and their halogenated,sulfonated,nitrated or nitrosated derivatives.as the plain terms of the heading suggest,htsus covers all ethers,including their various derivatives.notably,the heading does not distinguish ethers based on their method of manufacture.the parties agree that dcee is an ether and that it should therefore be classified under heading.
also in accordance with the applicable law,we next evaluate the relevant subheadings.the next classification covers acyclic ethers and their halogenated,sulfonated,nitrated or nitrosated derivatives.the parties also agree that horn dcee is an acyclic ether that belongs under this subheading.in addition,this subheading also does not distinguish ethers based on their manner of production.
the coordinate level contains only two for diethyl ether and subheading for other.this other category must therefore encompass all acyclic ethers other than diethyl ether.this includes their various derivatives because both superior headings specifically covered derivatives.and derivatives,as horn itself argues,should be given its broad,structurally related meaning.thus,the language of the subheadings suggests that subheading covers ethers according to their structure and not their manner of production.
in addition to the language of the headings and subheadings,our conclusion rests in large part on the preservation of symmetry in these tariff provisions.we agree with the government that horn proposed interpretation inconsistently reads diethyl ether as encompassing structurally related derivatives,but reads ethers of monohydric alcohol more narrowly to require that they be made from monohydric alcohol.we also agree with the government observation that horn interpretation would create an anomaly by yielding no classification for those acyclic ethers that are neither made from the listed alcohol groups nor derivatives of diethyl ether,despite the fact that the subheading clearly intends to cover all acyclic ethers.finally,we note that horn proposed classification system would permit the classification of identical ethers in different classes,with different duty rates,based on different methods of production.this interpretation,however,conflicts with the plain language of the tariff provisions applicable to ethers.because the subheadings under are eo nomine that describe goods by specific names known to include all forms of the article.see chevron chem.united states,d.int l trade.without clear language directing classification based on differences in production methods,we conclude customs properly refused to interpret the tariff provisions in the asymmetric manner horn suggests.
the explanatory notes and dictionary definitions,as the court of international trade reasoned,also support classifying ethers by their structure rather than their method of manufacture.in particular,the explanatory notes state that ethers have the general formula where r and may be the same or different.the fact that ethers have a general formula supports the conclusion that ethers are defined by their structure,not their manner of production.dictionary definitions similarly define ethers by their structure.one dictionary defines ethers as o ne of a class of organic compounds characterized by the structural feature of an oxygen linking two hydrocarbon groups such as.dictionary of scientific and technical terms ed.another provides the following definition a class of organic compounds in which an oxygen atom is interposed between two carbon atoms organic groups in the molecular structure,given the generic formula ror.hawley condensed chemical dictionary ed.these definitions support the conclusion that ethers are commonly defined by their structure rather than the method of manufacture.they thereby confirm our holding that the tariff schedule requires classification of ethers according to their structure.
the cases cited in support of horn arguments are inapposite.on the whole,the cases horn cites address tariff provisions wholly unlike those at issue here.in addition,none of these cases evinces the restrictive interpretation of the term of espoused by horn.finally,as the government explains,these cases demonstrate that congress has for years used more particular language to limit the classification of chemicals by source.in particular,it has consistently employed more instructive phrases such as derived from,produced from,or manufactured from.lacking such language here,we do not construe the tariff provisions in the limited manner that horn seeks.
