after remand,the united states court of international trade affirmed the department of commerce commerce countervailing duty rate on usinor products.allegheny ludlum united states,d.int l trade allegheny ii allegheny ludlum united states,d.int l trade allegheny i.because the court of international trade correctly determined that the methodology for calculating a countervailing duty rate is not in accordance with law,this court affirms.
in the,france became the sole owner of usinor and salicor,two french steel companies,and placed them under the ownership of a holding company,also called usinor.in,commerce determined that certain nonrecurring,subsidies to usinor were countervailable.these subsidies included conversions of loans with special characteristics into equity,conversions of certain bonds into equity,and shareholders advances.two years later,france began privatizing usinor through sales of stock to the french and international public,usinor employees,and stable shareholders,including investors that were restricted from selling during the privatization process.the privatization was complete by.
in,commerce initiated countervailing duty investigations to determine whether manufacturers of stainless steel sheet and strip were receiving countervailable subsidies in calendar year.approximately one year later,commerce issued its final affirmative determination,finding a total estimated net countervailable duty cvd of percent ad valorem for usinor.see final affirmative countervailing duty determination stainless steel sheet and strip in coils from france.june.in calculating that countervailable subsidy rate,commerce used its gamma methodology.
usinor challenged commerce determination before the court of international trade,but before that court could render a decision,commerce requested a remand to examine its methodology in light of delverde,srl united states,delverde iii.delverde iii invalidated the gamma methodology in view of f,enacted to overrule the court of international trade decision in saarstahl ag united states.int l trade,rev.in saarstahl,the court of international trade held that an arm length sale extinguished any competitive benefit,thus eliminating any countervailable subsidies.at.to the contrary,f provides 
a change in ownership of all or part of a foreign enterprise or the productive assets of a foreign enterprise does not by itself require a determination by the administering authority that a past countervailable subsidy received by the enterprise no longer continues to be countervailable,even if the change in ownership is accomplished through an arm length transaction.
f.under this section,this court in delverde iii examined the sale of the assets of a privately owned pasta producer to a different privately owned pasta producer.the pasta producer that sold its assets had received subsidies from the italian government.delverde iii called upon this court to determine whether the asset sale extinguished the subsidies.this court ruled that the statute proscribed a per se application of countervailing duties based on past countervailable subsidies.instead this court required commerce to examine the circumstances of the transaction to determine whether the countervailable subsidy survived the transfer.delverde iii,at.
upon remand after delverde iii,commerce applied a new methodology,designated the methodology,to usinor privatization.using four factors borrowed from general corporate law,the methodology examined the pre and entities in light of the continuity of general business operations the continuity of production facilities the continuity of assets and liabilities and the retention of personnel.from these four factors,commerce concluded that the only change to usinor was the identity of the shareholders.in particular,commerce determined that usinor was the same corporate person as usinor and had retained the subsidies.on the basis of this finding,commerce calculated usinor cvd rate to be percent ad valorem.usinor appealed to the court of international trade.
the court of international trade ruled that commerce methodology did not comply with delverde iii and f.specifically,the trial court observed that commerce may not create a per se rule.the trial court further found that the methodology,in practice,amounts to such an automatic rule and circumvents the requirement to look at the facts and circumstances of the transaction,to determine if the purchaser,received a subsidy,directly or indirectly,for which it did not pay adequate compensation.allegheny i,d at capitalization original.the trial court further noted 
from delverde iii,it is evident that commerce must determine if the subsidy continued to benefit the corporation.in this instance,commerce has developed a methodology that circumvents its statutorily mandated duty to determine if a benefit was conferred on the privatized corporation.
id.accordingly,the court remanded the case.id.at.in the second remand,commerce examined the details of the transaction and determined no countervailable subsidies survived the privatization of usinor.specifically,commerce found the overwhelming majority of the purchasers of usinor shares paid full,fair market value or more than full value for those shares and,therefore,did not receive any countervailable subsidy.results of redetermination pursuant to court remand,allegheny ludlum united states,cit,at june.thus,commerce examination of the details of the usinor transaction yielded a cvd rate of percent.on further review,the court of international trade affirmed.allegheny ii,d.
after this countervailing duty investigation was underway,commerce,for reasons unrelated to this litigation,abandoned the methodology in favor of a privatization methodology.the current privatization methodology examines the terms and conditions of a change in ownership,including whether the new owners paid fair market value for the privatized business.see notice of final modification of agency practice under section of the uruguay round agreements act.june.commerce changed its position because the world trade organization wto issued an appellate report stating that the methodology violates of the uruguay round agreements act uraa.see united measures concerning certain products from the european communities,r.commerce current practice,however,applies only prospectively to countervailing duty investigations initiated after june,or in some cases november.at.
commerce and the domestic producers collectively,allegheny ludlum now appeal,arguing that the methodology does not violate either the statute or precedent.
this court reviews antidumping judgments of the court of international trade by applying anew the same statutory standard as that court.micron,united states.the relevant statute states that the court shall hold unlawful any determination,finding or conclusion found to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b.this court reviews statutory construction without deference.saarstahl,ag united states.
in particular,this court reviews the court of international trade statutory construction under the procedure of chevron,natural resources defense council,d.under chevron,this court first examines whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.zenith elecs.united states.if,however,the intent of congress is not clear,this court defer s to the interpretation commerce has given its own governing statute.fujitsu united states.because congress has spoken directly to the issue of whether commerce may treat sales of stock differently from sales of assets,this court need not defer to commerce interpretation.
the parties do not dispute that usinor received nonrecurring countervailable subsidies before the privatization.therefore the applicable statutory provision governs the standards for assessing the effect of a change in ownership on the preexisting subsidies.the provision recites 
a change in ownership of all or part of a foreign enterprise or the productive assets of a foreign enterprise does not by itself require a determination by the administering authority that a past countervailable subsidy received by the enterprise no longer continues to be countervailable,even if the change in ownership is accomplished through an arm length transaction.
f.this court has already construed that provision in circumstances quite similar to this case.in delverde iii,this court explained 
section f clearly states that a subsidy can not be concluded to have been extinguished solely by an arm length change of ownership.however,it is also clear that congress did not intend the opposite,that a change in ownership always requires a determination that a past countervailable subsidy continues to be countervailable,regardless whether the change of ownership is accomplished through an arm length transaction or not.if that had been congress intent,the statute would have so stated.rather,the change of ownership provision simply prohibits a per se rule either way.
delverde iii,at emphasis original.accordingly,a change in ownership neither necessarily extinguishes nor necessarily carries over a countervailable subsidy.instead,this statute requires a inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the transfer of ownership,beyond the simple inquiry into whether the transaction occurred at arm length.moreover,this court further clarified 
t his provision does not direct commerce to use any particular methodology for determining the existence of a subsidy in a change of ownership situation.reading this provision together with the previous subsections clear directions for determining the existence of a subsidy,we conclude that the statute does not contemplate any exception to the requirement that commerce determine that a government provided both a financial contribution and benefit to a person,either directly or indirectly,by one of the acts enumerated,before charging it with receipt of a subsidy,even when that person bought corporate assets from another person who was previously subsidized.
id.this court clarified that the statute requires commerce to determine that the purchaser received both a financial contribution and benefit from a government,albeit indirectly through the seller,before concluding that the purchaser was subsidized.id.at.based on this reasoning,this court invalidated commerce prior gamma methodology.under that methodology,commerce presumed that the subsidies granted to the former owner automatically passed through to delverde following the sale.id.at.moreover,pertinent to the present case,delverde iii explained commerce deemed the fact that delverde bought the assets,as agreed to by both parties,at fair market value to be irrelevant to the determination whether it received a subsidy.it did not consider any of the facts or circumstances of the sale relevant.id.at emphases original.because commerce did not consider all facts and circumstances,including whether adequate remuneration had changed hands during the transaction,this court held that commerce methodology violated the statutory scheme.id.at.
this case evinces a factual difference from delverde iii that does not reflect any legal significance.in delverde iii,delverde,a private company,purchased corporate assets,including a pasta manufacturing facility,name,and trademark,from a private company that had received past countervailable subsidies from italy.id.at.in this case,france owned usinor and provided nonrecurring countervailable subsidies to the company,then transferred ownership to private individuals and entities through the sale of ownership shares in the private usinor corporation.commerce contends that the form of the versus this court to distinguish delverde iii.specifically,commerce argues that the subsidy creates a financial liability that belongs to and resides in the corporation itself,not the owners of the corporation.thus,according to commerce,the transfer of ownership through sales of stock could not extinguish liability for past countervailable subsidies.thus,as in the delverde iii case,commerce argues that purchases at fair market value are irrelevant to the receipt of prior subsidies.to the contrary,in addition to delverde iii,this court has repeatedly approved consideration of fair market value in assessing countervailing duties in privatization transactions,albeit under an earlier version of this particular statute.see inland steel bar united states,saarstahl,at.moreover,this court interpretation of avoids unnecessary conflict between domestic law and the international obligations of this country.see murray charming betsy,cranch.
this court most important reason,however,for refusing commerce invitation to treat transfers of ownership through sales of stock differently than through sales of assets is the statute.first and foremost,the statute expressly requires the evaluation of sales of assets and sales of stock on equivalent terms.indeed,the statutory language mentions them in the alternative a change in ownership of all or part of a foreign enterprise or the productive assets of a foreign enterprise.f emphasis added.the first category refers to a sale of stock the second refers to a sale of assets.the disjunctive between the first and second indicates that the law does not permit commerce to treat a change of ownership differently based on the form of the transaction.after requiring equivalent treatment of these forms of ownership changes,the statute proceeds to proscribe any automatic assessment that these transfers necessarily extinguish countervailable subsidies even where the transaction occurred at arm length.this statutory language,however,equates transfers of ownership irrespective of the transaction form and impeaches commerce attempt to make a distinction.
the legislative history of this section confirms that the language does not permit a distinction between stock sales and asset sales.the house report states 
section f provides that a change in the ownership of all or part of a foreign enterprise,a firm or a division of a firm or the productive assets of a firm,even if accomplished through an transaction,does not by itself require commerce to find that past countervailable subsidies received by the firm no longer continue to be countervailable.
the issue of the privatization of a firm can be extremely complex and multifaceted.while it is the committee intent that commerce retain the discretion to determine whether,and to what extent,the privatization of a firm eliminates any previously conferred countervailable subsidies,commerce must exercise this discretion carefully through its consideration of the facts of each case and its determination of the appropriate methodology to be applied.
part i,at,reprinted in.the senate report echoes the same approach that commerce should employ when examining a change in ownership in light of countervailing duties 
a change in the ownership of all or part of a foreign enterprise,a firm or a division of a firm or its productive assets does not by itself require the commerce department to determine that a countervailable subsidy received by the firm prior to the change in ownership no longer continues to be countervailable,even if the change in ownership occurs through an arms length transaction defined as a transaction negotiated between unrelated parties,each acting in its own interest,or between related parties such that the terms of the transaction are those that would exist if the transaction had been negotiated between unrelated parties.
the commerce department should continue to have the discretion to determine whether,and to what extent if any,actions such as the privatization of a company actually serve to eliminate such subsidies.it is the committee expectation that commerce will exercise this discretion carefully and make its determination based on the facts of each case,developing a methodology consistent with the principles of the countervailing duty statute.
at.thus,the house report and the senate report both reiterate that commerce must treat different forms of ownership change equivalently and both encourage careful consideration of all the fa
