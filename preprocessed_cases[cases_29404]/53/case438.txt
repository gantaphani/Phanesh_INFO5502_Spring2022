the united states appeals from a decision of the united states court of international trade holding that the united states customs service customs did not liquidate a particular entry of goods within the statutorily allotted time,and that therefore,pursuant to d the entry was deemed liquidated at the rate and amount of duty deposited by the importer.the government challenges the court ruling as to when the period for customs to liquidate the entry began to run.it also challenges the court interpretation of section d.because we reject the government arguments,we affirm the court decision.
background 
in march of,international trading company itc imported shop towels from a company in bangladesh,sonar cotton mills,sonar.at the time of their entry into the united states,the towels were subject to an antidumping duty order that required a cash deposit of an antidumping duty computed at the rate of.this resulted in itc depositing an antidumping duty in the amount of with respect to the march entry.on april,the department of commerce commerce published a notice in the federal register that it would conduct a third administrative review of the antidumping duty order,covering the period from march,to february.initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews.final liquidation of the march entry was therefore suspended pursuant to d.
the final results of the third administrative review were published on october.shop towels from bangladesh final results of administrative review.the final results announced an antidumping duty rate of for sonar towels for the period march,through february.on july,commerce issued liquidation instructions to customs by,informing customs that suspension of liquidation was lifted and ordering customs to liquidate entries subject to the administrative review.
on september,almost one year after publication of the final results,customs liquidated itc march shop towel entry at the rate determined in the third administrative review.this resulted in in additional antidumping duty being owed with respect to the entry.itc protested the liquidation,pointing to d.section d provides that e xcept as provided in section a of this title,when a suspension of liquidation is removed,customs shall liquidate the entry,unless liquidation is extended,within six months after receiving notice of the removal from commerce.the statute also provides that a ny entry not liquidated by customs within six months after receiving such notice shall be treated as having been liquidated at the rate of duty,value,quantity and amount of duty asserted at the time of entry by the importer of record.id.itc argued that the suspension of liquidation was removed in this case on october,when the results of the third administrative review were published.therefore,according to itc,pursuant to section d,the march entry was deemed liquidated six months later on april,at the rate in effect and the amount of duty deposited at the time of entry.after customs denied the protest,itc paid the increased antidumping duty.
on february,itc filed suit in the court of international trade,seeking a refund of the in additional antidumping duty it had paid with respect to the march entry of shop towels.eventually moving for summary judgment,itc contended that the march entry should have been deemed liquidated at the original deposit rate of pursuant to d,because customs had failed to liquidate the entry within the allotted period.for summary judgment,the government argued that publication of the final results of an administrative review in the federal register does not constitute notice to customs of the removal of a suspension of liquidation within the meaning of section d.it also argued that the proviso in the first sentence of section d,e xcept as provided in section a of this title,means that if an entry is subject to section a,it is not subject to the deemed liquidation mandate of section d.for these reasons,the government urged,the time period for liquidating the march entry of shop towels did not begin until july,when commerce issued liquidation instructions to customs by.
ruling on the motions for summary judgment,the court of international trade held that,in accordance with d,the march entry was deemed liquidated at the deposit rate because customs had failed to liquidate the entry within the allotted period.int l trading united states,d cit summary judgment order.the court rejected the government contention that publication of the final results of the third administrative review in the federal register did not constitute notice to customs of removal of the suspension of liquidation within the meaning of d.in addressing the government argument on this point,the court relied on our decision in international trading united states,international trading ii.summary judgment order,d at.in international trading ii,we held that the april suspension of liquidation of shop towel entries from bangladesh during the period march,to february,was removed upon publication of the final results of the second administrative review in the federal register,and that this publication constituted notice to customs within the meaning of d.
the court of international trade noted that the case before it was similar in all material respects to the action that was the subject of our decision in international trading ii,except that the entry at issue in this case was made approximately one month after the last entry covered by international trading ii.summary judgment order,d at.unlike the entries at issue in international trading ii,which were covered by the second administrative review,the entries at issue in this case were covered by the third administrative review and,consequently,were subject to the amendments under the uruguay round agreements act uraa,stat.these amendments added the e xcept as provided in section a of this title proviso to section d.section a provides,in relevant part,that if commerce orders the liquidation of entries pursuant to an administrative review,the entries are to be liquidated promptly and,to the greatest extent practicable,within days after the instructions to commerce are issued.a b.the court rejected the government contention that the proviso meant that an entry subject to the administrative review provisions of section a is exempt from the deemed liquidation mandate of section d.the court of international trade determined that sections d and a work together to effectuate expedient customs liquidation in the following manner 
under a,an entry that is not liquidated by customs within days after the commerce liquidation order confers the right upon the importer to demand an explanation from the secretary of the treasury.if the entry has still not been liquidated or extended six months after notice of removal of suspension publication in the federal register,then d directs that liquidation be effected by operation of the law.
summary judgment order,d at.
the court consequently granted itc motion for summary judgment,ruling that the period for deemed liquidation pursuant to section d was not triggered when customs received liquidation instructions from commerce on july,but rather,when the results of the third administrative review were published in the federal register on october.as a result,the court held,the march entry was deemed liquidated by operation of law six months later on april,at the rate asserted and the amount of duty deposited at the time of entry.summary judgment order,d at.
discussion 
we review the court of international trade grant of summary judgment for correctness as a matter of law,deciding de novo i the proper interpretation of the governing statute and regulations and ii whether genuine issues of material fact exist.int l light metals united states.in this case,the material facts are not in dispute.
the government first argument on appeal is that the court of international trade,relying on international trading ii,erred in holding that publication of the final results of the third administrative review in the federal register provided notice to customs of the removal of the suspension of liquidation of the march shop towel entry.the government argues that publication of the final results in the federal register did not constitute notice to customs within the meaning of section d.in making this argument,the government points to the notice provision of the federal register act,which provides in relevant part as follows 
unless otherwise specifically provided by statute,filing of a document,required or authorized to be published by section of this title,is sufficient to give notice of the contents of the document to a person subject to or affected by it.
emphasis added.the government notes that a person is defined in as an individual,partnership,association or corporation.the government further notes that a federal agency is not included in the definition of a person and,indeed,is separately defined in section as the president,an executive department,an independent board.from this,the government advances the argument that while publication of a document in the federal register can constitute notice of the contents of the document to a person,it is not notice to customs,which,by definition,is not a person within the meaning of section.
the government states that it advanced this argument in its briefing in international trading ii which did not mention the argument and in an unsuccessful petition for panel rehearing following the decision in international trading ii.the government urges that the court erred in international trading ii when it held that publication of the final results of an administrative review in the federal register provides notice to customs of the removal of a suspension of liquidation.the government asks us to recommend to the full court that international trading ii be overruled en banc.see federal circuit rule a.
we are not persuaded by the government argument.international trading ii discussion of the issue of notice to customs is thorough and.the court stated 
for some of the same reasons that publication of the final results of an administrative review removes the suspension of liquidation,publication also provides notice of the removal to customs.publication in the federal register is a familiar manner of providing notice to parties in antidumping proceedings.see,d requiring the international trade commission and commerce to notify interested parties of their determinations by publication in the federal register c a requiring commerce to publish notice in the federal register if it decides to allow an importer to post a bond in lieu of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties c requiring commerce to publish notice in the federal register of the results of its determinations and to assess antidumping duties based on those published results a requiring parties who object to a commission decision to act within days after the date of publication of that decision in the federal register c tying the date for liquidation of entries affected by a relevant court decision to the date that notice of that court decision is published in the federal register.it therefore seems reasonable that congress intended for publication of the final results in the federal register to have some legal effect.
moreover,the date of publication provides an unambiguous and public starting point for the liquidation period,and it does not give the government the ability to postpone indefinitely the removal of suspension of liquidation and thus the date by which liquidation must be completed as would be the case if the liquidation period did not begin to run until commerce sent a message to customs advising of the removal of suspension of liquidation.beyond that,treating the date of notification as separate from the date of publication could lead to messy factual disputes about when customs actually received notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation.
int l trading ii,at.
thus,international trading ii based its ruling on the notice issue on a careful analysis of statutes relating to antidumping proceedings and on sensible policy considerations.moreover,we see nothing in the language of that compels the result the government urges.section simply states that filing of a document with the federal register office is sufficient to give notice of the contents to a person subject to or affected by it.that is not the same as stating that filing of a document by a government agency is not sufficient notice to a sister government agency.we therefore reject the government request that we ask the full court to act en banc to overrule international trading ii.
under international trading ii,the suspension of liquidation of the march shop towel entry was removed on october,when commerce published notice of the results of the third administrative review in the federal register.also under international trading ii,publication of the results of the administrative review in the federal register gave customs notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation.thus,were it not for the amendment adding the e xcept as provided clause to d,this case would be on all fours with international trading ii.in short,there would be no question that,in accordance with the plain language of section d,the march shop towel entry was deemed liquidated at the rate of entry on april,six months after the removal of the suspension of its liquidation.what we must now address is whether the amendment changes that result.we begin with the statutory language.section d provides as follows 
d removal of suspension 
except as provided in section a of this title,when a suspension required by statute or court order is removed,the customs service shall liquidate the entry,unless liquidation is extended under subsection b of this section within months after receiving notice of the removal from the department of commerce.any entry other than an entry with respect to which liquidation has been extended under subsection b of this section not liquidated by the customs service within months after receiving such notice shall be treated as having been liquidated at the rate of duty,value,quantity,and amount of duty asserted at the time of entry by the importer of record.
d.section a,which is referenced in the first sentence of section d,provides in relevant part as follows 
b liquidation of entries.
if the administering authority orders any liquidation of entries pursuant to a review under paragraph such liquidation shall be made promptly and,to the greatest extent practicable,within days after the instructions to customs are issued.in any case in which liquidation has not occurred within that period,the secretary of the treasury shall,upon the request of the affected party,provide an explanation thereof.
congress enacted section in,in order to restrict the length of time customs could take to liquidate an entry.see a,stat.congress sought to increase certainty in the customs process for importers,surety companies,and other third parties with a potential liability relating to a customs transaction.international trading ii,at quoting united states,cit.congress originally imposed a maximum time period for liquidation starting from the date of entry of the merchandise and a time period in which customs could liquidate entries after the removal of a suspension of liquidation.id.however,in,congress amended section d in order to address an anomaly in the version of the statute,which made deemed liquidation available if suspension of liquidation were removed before the expiration of the maximum period for liquidating entries,but not if suspension of liquidation were removed after the expiration of the period.id.citing.at the amendment also increased the time period in which customs could liquidate entries after the removal of a suspension of liquidation from ninety days to six months.international trading ii,at.in international trading ii,we noted that one of the primary objectives of the amendments was to remove the government unilateral ability to extend indefinitely the time for liquidating entries.id.at.
section d was amended just one year later,after the united states signed the uruguay round agreements in.annexed to the uruguay round agreements was the agreement on implementation of article vi of the gen
