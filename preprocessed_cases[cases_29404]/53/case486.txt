koyo seiko,and koyo corporation of collectively,koyo appeal the decision of the united states court of international trade in timken united states,d cit,holding that the united states department of commerce commerce properly zeroed any negative dumping margins in calculating the dumping margin applied to imports of koyo tapered roller bearings trbs from japan.the timken company timken cross appeals arguing that commerce,in calculating koyo constructed export price cep,improperly applied the rate to the entered value rather than the sales value of koyo trbs.because we agree with the court of international trade that commerce properly resolved both issues,we affirm.
commerce issues antidumping duty orders for imported merchandise that is sold in the united states below its fair value and materially injures or threatens to injure a domestic industry.see.specifically,commerce determines the antidumping duties by first calculating the dumping margin,which is the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price or constructed export price of the subject merchandise.id.a see also koyo seiko united states.commerce uses a cep if,before or after the time of importation,the first sale to an unaffiliated person is made by or for the account of the producer or exporter or by a seller in the united states who is affiliated with the producer or exporter.uruguay round agreements act,statement of administrative action,doc,at,reprinted in saa various adjustments may be made to cep,including reduction by the cost of any further manufacture or assembly in the united states.see d.
after calculating the dumping margins on the individual transactions subject to review,commerce calculates the dumping margin by dividing the aggregate dumping margins determined for a specific exporter or producer by the aggregate constructed export prices of such exporter or producer.id.b see also koyo seiko,at.when calculating the dumping margin,commerce treats transactions that generate negative dumping margins,a dumping margin with a value less than zero as if they were zero.see,serampore indus.dep t of commerce.int l trade.this practice is referred to as zeroing.finally,commerce uses this dumping margin to calculate the duties owed on an basis.a.
in this case commerce initiated an administrative review of alleged sales of trbs from japan at less than fair value during the period of october,through september.initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews,fed.reg.based on its review,commerce calculated preliminary dumping margins of on trbs greater than four inches in diameter and on trbs less than four inches in diameter.tapered roller bearings and parts thereof,finished and unfinished,from japan,and tapered roller bearings,four inches or less in outside diameter,and components thereof,from japan preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative reviews,fed.reg,preliminary results.koyo exported both types of merchandise and thus became potentially liable for antidumping duties.id.both koyo and timken subsequently filed case and rebuttal briefs,with koyo questioning,inter alia,commerce zeroing practice,and timken questioning,inter alia,commerce application of the rate to the entered value rather than sales value of koyo trbs.

the court of international trade review of commerce final results dealt with,inter alia koyo arguments that commerce improperly zeroed negative dumping margins when calculating koyo dumping margins,and timken arguments that commerce should have applied the rate to the sales value of koyo trbs.see timken,d at.as to the first issue,koyo primarily argued that commerce statutory interpretation was unreasonable in light of the world trade organization wto appellate body interpretation of the antidumping duty agreement ada in european duties on imports of bed linen from india,linen.timken,d at.rejecting the government threshold argument that c barred koyo appeal,the court of international trade went on to note that it had previously affirmed zeroing as a reasonable interpretation of.id.at citing serampore.at.int l trade bowe passat waschereitechnik gmbh united states.int l trade.it also distinguished the linen report because it did not address the practice of zeroing,and dealt with an antidumping investigation rather than an administrative review.id.given that the statute requires commerce to calculate dumping duties on an approach and that previous cases determined that zeroing is a reasonable practice under the statute,the court of international trade found commerce zeroing practice reasonable.id.
addressing timken arguments that commerce should have applied the rate to the sales value of koyo trbs,the court of international trade affirmed commerce approach.first,the court found it was consistent with the regulations,see b,and prior court holdings.timken,d at citing ntn bearing of am.united states,d.int l trade.second,according to the court,commerce properly adhered to the overriding goal of accurately determining dumping margins,rather than creating an overly punitive result.id.at.because the value of koyo trbs increased substantially as a result of manufacturing,and because subjecting this increase to duties would have been contrary to the purpose of the statute,the court found that commerce reasonably used the entered value.id.at.the court of international trade therefore upheld commerce application of the rate to koyo entered value commerce decision was supported by substantial evidence and not contrary to law.id.

on appeal,koyo argues that commerce acted unreasonably in zeroing transactions.it contends this practice violates a,which calls for a fair comparison of export price ep or cep and normal value.koyo relies on the wto appellate body decision in linen,holding that the practice of zeroing when calculating dumping margins is not a fair comparison between ep or cep and normal value.thus,because a specifically implements the fair comparison requirements of article of the ada,and because commerce refused to interpret the statute in a manner consistent with international obligations by ignoring the holding in linen,koyo asks that we find that commerce acted unreasonably in zeroing transactions.
timken and the united states respond that the plain meaning of the antidumping statute calls for commerce to zero transactions,and that the legislative history confirms this reading.alternatively,even assuming that the statute contains an ambiguous instruction,timken and the united states argue that commerce reasonably interpreted the statute and deserves deference.addressing koyo arguments relying on linen,timken and the united states reiterate the distinctions between that case and this case articulated by the court of international trade.finally,timken and the united states argue that c and the saa bar koyo from bringing this challenge,and that precludes us from addressing the implementation of adverse wto decisions.
we begin by addressing the government argument that c bars koyo from bringing this action.section c bars parties from bringing claims directly against the government on the ground that commerce acted inconsistently with the uruguay round agreements act uraa.c.as the court of international trade noted,however,koyo brought this action under law under the assumption that it would be interpreted so as to avoid a conflict with international obligations.timken,d at.we agree and find that c does not prevent us from addressing koyo appeal.
on the merits of koyo appeal,we apply a familiar inquiry to determine whether to sustain an agency interpretation of the statutory scheme it is charged with administering.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.first,we determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,however,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.in this case,therefore,we must determine whether the statute unambiguously requires providing for zeroing negative margin transactions and,if not,whether commerce reasonably interpreted the statute to so require.
turning to the words of the statute,a defines dumping margin as the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price or constructed export price of the subject merchandise.a emphasis added.timken and the united states both argue that the use of the word exceeds limits the definition of dumping margin to positive numbers.in support of their argument,they appropriately cite dictionaries.pesquera mares australes ltda.united states,in order to ascertain the established meaning of a commonly used term it is appropriate to consult dictionaries.these dictionaries define exceeds as to be or go beyond the given or supposed limit,measure,or quantity,webster new twentieth century dictionary of the english language unabridged ed,or.to be greater than surpass.to go beyond the limits of,the american heritage college dictionary.
recognizing this as a close question,we are reluctant to find these dictionary definitions so clear as to compel a finding that congress expressly intended to require zeroing.even using the above greater than definitions,the statute does not plainly require consideration of only those dumping margins with a positive value.at least in a mathematical context,exceeds does not unambiguously preclude the calculation of a negative dumping margin.we thus disagree with the government position that congress deliberately used the word exceeds to avoid the calculation of negative dumping margins,instead of using the more phrase difference between.rather,the word exceeds could arguably allow for negative dumping margins because it guides the manner in which to set up the mathematical exceeds y.similarly,the words difference between could arguably be construed as calling for the absolute value of the difference,a positive difference between x and y.finally,reviewing the legislative history as a whole,we disagree with timken argument that the relevant statements,or lack thereof,conclusively demonstrate congress adoption of definitions specifically requiring zeroing.accordingly,we conclude that congress use of the word exceeds does not unambiguously require that dumping margins be positive numbers.
because we find that the statute does not directly speak to the issue of dumping margins,we evaluate whether commerce interpretation is based on a permissible statutory construction.under this second step of the chevron analysis,a ny reasonable construction of the statute is a permissible construction.torrington united states.to survive judicial scrutiny,commerce construction need not be the only reasonable interpretation or even the most reasonable interpretation rather,a court must defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of a statute even if the court might have preferred another.koyo seiko united states,citing zenith radio united states,d.indeed,we have accorded particular deference to commerce in antidumping determinations.see group united states,the secretary has broad discretion in executing the law.
we conclude commerce based its zeroing practice on a reasonable interpretation of the statute.first,while the statutory definitions do not unambiguously preclude the existence of negative dumping margins,they do at a minimum allow for commerce construction.basically,one number exceeds another if it is greater than the other,meaning it falls to the right of it on the number line.here,because commerce zeroing practice is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language,we do not question it in light of other reasonable possibilities.
second,commerce methodology for calculating dumping margins makes practical sense.commerce calculates dumping duties on an basis.a.its practice of zeroing negative dumping margins comports with this approach.borrowing timken example,suppose a foreign exporter sells the same product to two customers.the product has a normal value of,and is sold to the first customer for and the second customer for.calculated in accordance with a,the dumping margin for the first customer is zeroed and for the second customer is.assuming sales of units to each customer,the first customer would not have to pay any dumping duties because it paid a price above normal value,and the second customer would have to pay transactions x dumping because it paid a price below normal value.this approach makes sense it neutralizes dumped sales and has no effect on sales.on the other hand,the approach urged by koyo,whereby commerce could not zero negative transactions,would essentially require commerce to grant the first customer a credit.in the absence of offsetting sales below fair market value,however,commerce could potentially owe the first customer a result clearly not contemplated by the statutory scheme.
third,we note that the court of international trade has specifically addressed commerce zeroing practice and found it reasonable and in accordance with the law.see serampore.at bowe passat.at.we find these decisions instructive for purposes of our analysis.notably,both of these cases found zeroing to be a reasonable statutory interpretation given that it legitimately combats the problem of masked dumping,wherein certain profitable sales serve to mask sales at less than fair value.serampore.at bowe passat.at.although koyo argues that these decisions addressed the law as it existed prior to the adoption of the uraa fair comparison requirements,we find this argument unpersuasive.neither the nor the current definitions unambiguously address the practice of zeroing.the fair comparison requirement,which simply applies to the calculation of normal value under a,does not change this result.the definitions do,however,lend support to commerce statutory construction as discussed above,even when considered in light of this new fair comparison requirement.according commerce its proper deference,we hold that it reasonably interpreted a to allow for zeroing.
we turn now to koyo argument that commerce unreasonably interpreted to allow for zeroing,beginning with a review of the wto linen report upon which koyo so heavily relies.linen dealt with a trade dispute between the european community ec and india.linen,r.the ec,in investigating and levying duties on the importation of bed sheets from india,engaged in the practice of zeroing transactions.see id.india brought an action at the wto,claiming that the ec practice of zeroing violated article of the ada.see id.the wto appellate body evaluated the ec practice in light of both this article and article,which states that one must make a fair comparison between the ep or cep and the normal value when calculating dumping margins.id.it too
