this is a consolidated appeal by allegheny ludlum,et collectively,allegheny from two united states court of international trade antidumping decisions upholding determinations by the department of commerce commerce we hold that alleged errors in earlier interim decisions by the court of international trade setting aside commerce initial determination in each of these two cases and remanding for further proceedings,provide no ground for setting aside commerce most recent decisions because commerce most recent decisions were not compelled by the remand orders.
another question presented by commerce recent decisions is whether commerce must assess duties on all exported merchandise of a foreign producer at a single weighted average rate calculated to include middleman dumping as well as the producer own dumping.we uphold commerce decision not to use a single weighted average rate and affirm the court of international trade.
background 
the procedural history of these consolidated cases is complex and is set forth in detail in the opinions of the court of international trade.allegheny ludlum united states,d.int l trade allegheny tung mung dev.united states,d.int l trade tung mung.for present purposes the facts can be stated simply.
commerce is charged with determining whether dumping has occurred,defined as the sale or likely sale of goods at less than fair value.if commerce finds that dumping has occurred to the detriment of the domestic industry,it is required by statute to impose antidumping duties on that merchandise.id.the united states customs service then collects a cash deposit from the importer of such merchandise in the amount of the antidumping duty assessed by commerce.the final amount of these duties is later determined on administrative review.a foreign producer of goods may engage in dumping,but dumping may also occur as the result of sales by a middleman,reseller.although the antidumping statute does not explicitly address middleman dumping,the language of the act is broad enough to cover it,and the legislative history of the trade agreements act of,stat,codified at,indicates that congress intended commerce to address below cost sales by middlemen as well as direct dumping by foreign producers,at,at,reprinted in.
the two taiwanese steel companies that are appellees in these consolidated cases,tung mung development tung mung and yieh united steel yieh steel,sold some of their merchandise directly to the united states and other merchandise to a independent taiwanese company,ta chen stainless pipe ta chen.ta chen then resold tung mung and yieh steel merchandise to its own customers in the united states.there are,therefore,three types of sales involved here direct sales by the producers to united states customers sales by the producers to the middleman and sales by the middleman to united states customers.
in,commerce initiated simultaneous dumping investigations of tung mung and yieh steel merchandise,including alleged dumping in the producers direct sales to united states customers,the producers alleged dumping in sales to ta chen,and ta chen alleged dumping in sales to united states customers middleman dumping.one of these investigations involved dumping of both yieh steel and tung mung stainless steel sheet and strip in coils ssss and led to the appeal from tung mung dev.united states,d.int l trade.the other investigation involved dumping of yieh steel stainless steel plate in coils sspc and led to the appeal of allegheny ludlum united states,d.int l trade.
i.the ssss investigation 
in june of,commerce completed its investigation of yieh steel and tung mung ssss exports and found that yieh steel engaged in dumping in its direct sales to united states customers as well as in its sales to ta chen that tung mung did not engage in dumping in either its direct sales to united states customers or in its sales to ta chen and that ta chen engaged in middleman dumping in its sales to united states customers of both yieh steel and tung mung merchandise.commerce next step was to assess antidumping duties on these ssss exports.
commerce used a single weighted average rate to compute antidumping duties on yieh steel and tung mung ssss exports.this approach calculated the dumping margins of the producer direct sales of ssss to united states customers the dumping margin of the producer sales of ssss to the middleman,ta chen and the dumping margin of ta chen sales of ssss to united states customers.these three dumping margins were then weight averaged to apply a single rate to all of the producer ssss merchandise exported to the united states,whether exported by the producer or by the middleman the use of a single weighted average method of calculation applied the same antidumping duty rate to ssss exported directly by the producer and ssss exported by the middleman ta chen,despite the fact that the ssss exported through these different channels involved different dumping margins.for tung mung,whose direct exports were assessed a de minimis dumping margin,the single weighted average rate effectively denied it an antidumping exemption for its direct sales to united states customers.
in july of,yieh steel and tung mung appealed commerce decision,contending that commerce should have used a combination rate.a combination rate approach calculates antidumping duties based only on the dumping that occurred in the merchandise specific channel of exportation thus,merchandise that is sold directly by a producer to united states customers is assessed an antidumping duty that reflects only the producer dumping margin on such sales.merchandise sold by a middleman to united states customers is assessed an antidumping duty that accounts for the producer dumping margin on its sale to the middleman and the middleman dumping margin on its sale to united states customers.
the practical difference between the combination rate approach and the single weighted average rate approach is that the producer is held responsible only for its own dumping to united states customers under the former approach,but the producer is effectively accountable for middleman dumping as well under the latter approach.
the court of international trade found that the relevant antidumping statutory and regulatory provisions neither support ed nor explicitly foreclose d commerce use of the single,weighted average cash deposit rate.tung mung,d at however,the court concluded that commerce decision to use a single weighted average rate was not entitled to chevron deference,see chevron natural res.def.council,d,because it was an agency interpretation that lack ed the force of law and instead was only due skidmore deference,which entitled it to respect to the extent that it ha d the power to persuade.tung mung remand,slip op.at.
the court also concluded that the use of a single weighted average was a change from commerce prior practice with regard to the imposition of combination rates where there is a finding of middleman dumping and the producer is a named respondent.id.at.the court found that in the only prior investigation of middleman dumping,fuel ethanol from brazil final determination of sales at less than fair value,fuel ethanol,commerce employed a combination rate methodology to set antidumping duties.tung mung remand,slip op.at.and,the court explicitly rejected the appellants argument that the prior practice established in fuel ethanol was displaced by the preamble to commerce regulations at.id.at.finding that commerce has not adequately explained its decision not to follow its prior practice of issuing combination rates,the court remanded to commerce for reconsideration of its middleman dumping methodology.id.at.the court instructed commerce to provide a reasonable explanation and substantial evidence for its change in practice from a combination rate to a single weighted average,or apply a combination rate,consistent with its prior practice.id.at.
ii.the sspc investigation 
meanwhile in march of,commerce concluded its investigation of sspc merchandise and found that yieh steel engaged in dumping in its direct sales to united states customers and in its sales to ta chen and that ta chen also engaged in dumping in its middleman sales of yieh steel sspc to united states customers.
commerce initially employed a combination rate approach instead of a single weighted average rate approach.commerce thereby established two separate cash deposit rates of estimated dumping duties for yieh steel sspc exports to the united states one for merchandise directly exported by yieh steel to united states customers and another for merchandise exported through ta chen to united states customers.allegheny ludlum united states,d.int l trade.ta chen dumping was reflected only in the cash deposit rates imposed on that portion of yieh steel sspc that ta chen itself had exported.
on december,on appeal of commerce sspc antidumping determination,the court of international trade granted commerce request for a remand to reconsider its decision to use a combination rate.id.at.in the remand determination,issued on march,commerce decided to use a single weighted average rate,instead of a combination rate,to calculate yieh steel antidumping duties on its sspc exports.allegheny ludlum united states,dep t commerce,available at.
on appeal,the court of international trade again remanded commerce sspc determination on august,in light of the opinion issued in the ssss case,and ordered commerce to provide a reasonable explanation and substantial evidence for its change in practice,or apply a combination rate.allegheny remand.
iii.commerce redetermination 
after the most recent remands,commerce issued almost identical determinations in both the ssss and the sspc cases.these two decisions,allegheny ludlum united states,slip op.at dep t commerce,and tung mung dev.united states,slip op.at dep t commerce,collectively,the redetermination,use the same language and reasoning although commerce did not agree with the court of international trade conclusion that it had a previously settled practice of using combination rates,it decided to apply combination rates in both cases.
commerce decisions,issued on november,explained that the two central interests of antidumping law are,on the one hand,to offset all of the dumping of subject merchandise that enters the united states and to avoid evasion of antidumping duties,and,on the other hand,to only associat e dumping with the party or parties responsible for it.redetermination at.commerce reasoned that if it used a single weighted average methodology to calculate duties on the producer goods that is,in part,based upon the middleman unfair pricing behavior,commerce may successfully offset all dumping of that subject merchandise,but plac e an undue burden on the shoulders of the producer for the unforeseen actions of a middleman over which it had no control.id.at.this result would undermine commerce objective of associating dumping with the party responsible for it.
consequently,commerce adopted a standard that would more appropriately associate dumping with the responsible party.thus,when it has no basis to believe or suspect that the producer was aware or should have been aware that the middleman would be likely to dump subject merchandise into the united states,use of a combination rate is appropriate.id.at.in turn,the foreign producer merchandise that was not exported through the middleman would not be assessed duties for the middleman dumping.when,however,a producer is aware or should have been aware of the likelihood of the middleman dumping,commerce would use a single weighted average approach and impose antidumping duties on all of the foreign producer merchandise at a single rate,whether or not the middleman exported it.id.at.commerce explained that this approach would avoid penalizing the producer for dumping for which it is not responsible,and encourage the producer to find a middleman who will not engage in dumping,or to export directly to the united states.id.at.because commerce found that neither tung mung nor yieh steel had reason to know of ta chen dumping,it calculated middleman antidumping duties using a combination rate.
nonetheless,commerce explained that i n light of its limited experience with middleman dumping,it did not intend by this decision to announce a settled practice.id.at.
in,the court of international trade affirmed commerce redetermination decisions.allegheny,d at tung mung,d at.the court found that the use of combination rates comport s with the antidumping statute characterization of dumping duties as a remedial instrument and that commerce fulfill s its duty of preventing circumvention of the antidumping statute through the imposition of combination rates where no evidence exists that the producer has knowledge of the middleman dumping.allegheny,d at see also tung mung,d at.
discussion 
when reviewing commerce determinations,we apply anew the same standard of review used by the court of international trade.micron,united states.we sustain commerce determination unless it is arbitrary and capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.alloy piping,kanzen tetsu sdn,quoting b b i.
allegheny first claims that we should hold that the court of international trade remand orders were erroneous because they failed to give chevron deference to commerce original determinations that adopted a single weighted average method of assessing antidumping duties.following chevron and united states mead,d,we held in pesquera mares australes ltda.united states,that commerce antidumping determinations are adjudication s that produce rulings for which deference under chevron is claimed.id.at quoting mead,at.alterations in original.allegheny urges that these decisions demonstrate that the court of international trade remand decisions were incorrect and that we should reinstate commerce original decisions to adopt a single weighted average rate.we disagree.
even assuming that the court of international trade remand orders were erroneous those errors did not survive commerce decisions on remand to adopt a new policy.as the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized,the chevron doctrine contemplates that agencies can and will abandon existing policies and substitute new approaches.see,smiley citibank,d explaining that agency change is not invalidating,since the whole point of chevron is to leave the discretion provided by the ambiguities of a statute with the implementing agency.indeed,we have insisted that an agency must be allowed to assess the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis,skf usa united states,quoting chevron,at,and we have even held that it is error for a court in most circumstances to refuse an agency request for a remand to reconsider a policy.see id.
here,the court of international trade remand orders did not compel commerce to adopt a new policy.instead,they directed commerce to either explain its deviation from prior practice or apply a combination rate,consistent with its prior practice.tung mung remand,slip op.at allegheny remand,slip op.at.on remand,commerce made clear that it did not agree with the court assessment of its prior practice,highlighting the fact that it had limited experience with middleman dumping.redetermination at.commerce also made clear that it did not feel compelled to change its policy based on the court characterization of it as a deviation from settled practice.rather,commerce disagreed that it had a settled practice and abandoned the single weighted average approach because it independently concluded that it was desirable to adopt a different policy,stating that it was doing so because the facts and its analysis in this case indicates that such a methodology is appropriate.id.commerce explained that in its judgment the combination rate approach avoids penalizing the producer for dumping for which it is not responsible,and encourages the producer to find a middleman who will not engage in dumping,or to export directly to the united states.id.at.under such circumstances,any error in the remand orders is irrelevant because commerce redetermination decisions represent new,independent agency interpretations.
allegheny also claims that commerce new approach is invalid because it constitutes an unexplained departure
