background 
on july,commerce published an antidumping duty order on silicon metal from brazil.antidumping duty order silicon metal from brazil.july.in response to commerce notice of opportunity to request administrative review published in july,rima and several other brazilian producers of silicon metal requested commerce initiate an administrative review covering entries of the subject merchandise for the period of july,to june.initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews.following an extensive investigation,that included verification by commerce of rima records,on february,commerce concluded that silicon metal from brazil produced by rima and others was being sold at less than fair value ltfv.moreover,commerce calculated a dumping margin for rima from the period of march,to february.silicon metal from brazil notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review,final results.
ast challenged the final results on several grounds at the court of international trade.however,the only issue still in dispute is that relating to commerce reliance on rima reported depreciation expense in computing rima dumping margin.thus,we limit our discussion of the proceedings before that court to this issue.ast contended before the court of international trade that commerce understated rima dumping margin by relying on rima reported depreciation expense.according to ast,in view of f a,it was improper for commerce to rely on rima reported depreciation expense because it did not reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of rima silicon metal.ast asserted that rima improperly shifted the bulk of the depreciation expense,which in this case is that owing to furnaces,to a period prior to the period of review,thereby skewing the calculation of the cost of producing silicon metal in such a manner as to lower its dumping margin.according to ast,the straight line method used by rima does not comport with either united states or brazilian generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and brazillian gaap,respectively because the period of depreciation adopted does not adequately allocate the cost of those assets over their economic useful life.in addition to the inadequate allocation,ast contended that rima reported depreciation was unreliable because it was based on depreciation worksheets that were not kept as part of rima accounting system and because the reported expense did not reconcile with the fixed asset values stated in rima financial statements.commerce contended that rima depreciation method was consistent with brazilian gaap and that it reasonably relied on those records.
the court of international trade concluded that it was reasonable for commerce to rely on rima reported depreciation expense.the court noted that f a is silent as to the method commerce must use to establish depreciation expenses in cost of production calculations,but among other things does state that costs shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise,if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of merchandise.f a.the court also noted that the statement of administrative action saa,approved by congress under a,provides that it would be appropriate for commerce to adjust depreciation expenses in determining whether a company records reasonably reflect costs,where a firm financial statements reflect an extremely large amount of depreciation for the first year of an asset life,or where there is no depreciation expense reflected for assets that have been idle.agreement on implementation of article vi of the gatt,statement of administrative action,reprinted in.in view of the gap left in the statute and the saa,the court concluded that its review was limited to determining whether commerce interpretation in filling the gap regarding depreciation expense was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.
the court concluded that rima reported depreciation was not in need of adjustment under the saa because rima did not take an extremely large amount of depreciation during the assets first years.in addition,the court concluded that there was substantial evidence showing that the depreciation worksheets prepared for the review did reconcile to the financial statements.in particular,the court pointed out that the financial statements were independently audited,and that the auditors reported a depreciation expense in their audit opinion of the financial statements and confirmed adherence to a permissible depreciation methodology under brazilian gaap for that expense.furthermore,the court concluded that ast had not provided any verifiable records that the depreciation worksheets were not consistent with brazilian gaap,or that the reported depreciation did not reconcile to the financial statements.
the court also noted that gaap does not support ast position any better than brazilian gaap.in particular,the court pointed out that gaap does not set forth specifics regarding the estimated useful life of assets or the required depreciation methodology that a company must use,and that both may differ from company to company and across industries.in addition,the court recognized that whether an asset is used longer than its estimated useful life does not require that a longer useful life be used in the depreciation calculation because useful life and physical life,the amount of time that machinery and equipment actually operate,are not necessarily the same.accordingly,the court concluded that as long as a company reasonably and consistently matches revenue and expense by allocating the cost of depreciable assets systematically over their estimated useful lives,gaap is satisfied.for all of the foregoing reasons,the court of international trade concluded that the evidence and reasonable inferences from the record support commerce decision to rely on rima reported depreciation expense in its dumping margin calculations.
ast timely appealed the decision of the court of international trade to this court.we have jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a decision by the court of international trade of an antidumping determination by commerce by applying anew the statutory standard of review that the court applied in reviewing the administrative record.micron,united states.accordingly we will uphold commerce determination unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.quoting b b i.even if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from evidence in the record,such a possibility does not prevent commerce determination from being supported by substantial evidence.fujitsu united states.
cost of production 
as indicated previously,there is only one issue on appeal.that issue is whether commerce reliance on rima depreciation records in its final administrative review comports with the statutory requirements of f a.
commerce is required to impose an antidumping duty on imported merchandise that is being sold,or is likely to be sold,in the united states at less than its fair value to the detriment of a domestic industry.koyo seiko,united states.the amount of the duty equals the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price or the constructed export price for the merchandise.normal value is the price at which the foreign like product is first sold for consumption in the exporting country,in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and,to the extent practicable,at the same level of trade as the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold or agreed to be sold before the date of importation by the producer or exporter of the subject merchandise outside of the united states to an unaffiliated purchaser in the united states or to an unaffiliated purchaser for exportation to the united states,the export price or the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold or agreed to be sold in the united states before or after the date of importation by or for the account of the producer or exporter of such merchandise or by a seller affiliated with the producer or exporter,to a purchaser not affiliated with the producer or exporter,the constructed export price.a,a b skf usa united states.under specified circumstances,when commerce has reasonable grounds to believe that sales of the foreign like product under consideration for the determination of normal value were less than the cost of production,the statute mandates calculation of constructed value cv in lieu of normal.b skf,at.the cv serves as a minimum price level at which imported goods may be sold without incurring antidumping duties.thai pineapple pub.united states.goods sold for less than the cv are assessed duties in an amount designed to bring their effective price to the importer up to the minimum level.id.cv amounts are to include general expenses.e.the cost of general expenses includes overhead.ipsco,united states.depreciation is a part of overhead costs,which are costs of production.if depreciation is not included in production costs,the cv is lowered,thereby lowering the minimum price level at which imported goods may be sold without incurring antidumping duties,lowering the dumping margin calculations.
depreciation accounting 
the basic purpose of depreciation is to spread the cost of a capital asset over the accounting periods that benefit from the asset use.kermit larson and paul miller,fundamental accounting principles ed.without the benefit of hindsight,the beneficial period of an asset use,useful life,is necessarily an estimate,and it is usually not the same as actual life.id.at.this estimate takes into account the decrease in the service potential of the asset resulting from such causes as physical wear and tear through ordinary use,as well as obsolescence caused by technological changes and the introduction of new and better machinery and methods of production.id.
although this type of is an estimate,under gaap it is nevertheless supposed to be systematic and rational.glenn johnson and james gentry,finney and miller principles of accounting ed.a variety of generally accepted methods for allocating depreciation expenses of an asset exist,such as straight line,units of production,and double declining balance johnson at.while gaap requires the method chosen to be a reasonable reflection of the use of the asset,any method chosen is going to be artificial because depreciation is an allocation process as opposed to a valuation process.johnson at.
statutory landscape 
f a provides that for purposes of cv calculations 
costs shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise,if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise.the administering authority shall consider all available evidence on the proper allocation of costs,including that which is made available by the exporter or producer on a timely basis,if such allocations have been historically used by the exporter or producer,in particular for establishing appropriate amortization and depreciation periods,and allowances for capital expenditures and other development costs.
in other words,the statute provides that as a general rule,an agency may either accept financial records kept according to generally accepted accounting principles in the country of exportation,or reject the records if accepting them would distort the company true costs.thai pineapple,at ntn bearing united states.
we turn next to the saa,which is regarded as an authoritative expression by the united states concerning the interpretation and application of the foregoing statute.the saa provides 
in determining whether a company records reasonably reflect costs,commerce will consider generally accepted accounting principles employed by the industry in question.for example,a company records might not fairly allocate the cost of an asset if a firm financial statements reflect an extremely large amount of depreciation for the first year of an asset life,or if there is no depreciation expense reflected for assets that have been idle.in such a situation,it would be appropriate for commerce to adjust depreciation expenses.costs shall be allocated using a method that reasonably reflects and accurately captures all of the actual costs incurred in producing and selling the product under investigation or review.commerce also will consider whether the producer historically used its submitted cost allocation methods to compute the cost of the subject merchandise prior to the investigation or review and in the normal course of its business operations.also,if commerce determines that costs,including financing costs,have been shifted away from production of the subject merchandise,or the foreign like product,it will adjust cost appropriately,to ensure they are not artificially reduced.
agreement on implementation of article vi of the gatt,reprinted in at.
neither the statute nor the saa instructs commerce as to the methodology it must use to establish depreciation expenses in cv calculations.consequently,our review focuses on whether commerce was reasonable in accepting the depreciation methodology of rima.united states mead,d noting that where the legislative delegation to an agency of interpretive authority is implicit,a reviewing court is obliged to accept the agency position if congress has not previously spoken to the point at issue and the agency interpretation is reasonable.see also chevron,natural res.def.council,d thai pineapple,at daewoo int l union.
it is with the foregoing background in mind that we analyze the parties contentions and the record to assess commerce reasonableness in relying on rima reported depreciation expense.
relying on the same arguments it made before the court of international trade,ast contends that commerce reliance on rima reported depreciation was improper because this expense does not reasonably reflect rima cost of producing silicon metal.in particular,ast contends that costs were shifted away from rima production during this period of review by rima allocation of a useful life for its furnaces.according to ast,the record demonstrates that the useful life of rima furnaces is at least twenty years.ast notes that the brazilian income tax regulations that rima used to support its depreciation methodology state that the annual rate of depreciation for an asset for income tax purposes is determined based on of the useful life admitted for the asset acquired as new and can be further accelerated for assets used in two shifts or three shifts.ast asserts that rima arrived at an annual rate of twenty percent for these assets,correlating to a useful life,by taking of the normal twenty year useful life,assigning it a corresponding depreciation rate and then doubling that rate to account for the use of the furnaces in three shifts.according to ast,the foregoing confirms that the normal,depreciation for the silicon metal furnaces is twenty years.
ast also notes that the record reflects that the furnaces at issue had been operating far longer than five years.in addition,ast contends that rima reported a useful life for furnaces in an earlier administrative review covering the period.ast also notes that another brazilian producer of silicon metal has acknowledged that furnaces have a useful life.thus,ast argues,as a matter of law,it could not have been reasonable for commerce to rely on rima reported depreciation expen
