the mediterranean fruit fly,widely known as the medfly,may be smaller than a common it carries enormous weight.it is widely regarded as one of the world most destructive fruit pests.the medfly damages citrus and other fruits by planting eggs that hatch inside the fruit,and it reproduces rapidly a female medfly can lay as many as eggs during a lifetime of less than a month.the species originated in africa and is not established in the united states,except in hawaii,which has been infested for nearly a century.the first mainland infestation was reported in florida in.several infestations have been reported since then,especially in recent years,but intensive detection and eradication programs,notably in california,are believed to have prevented the pest from becoming permanently established.
the medfly is viewed as a serious threat to california agricultural sector and general economy.california,the world fifth largest agricultural economy,produces more than billion worth of fruits and vegetables annually.medfly infestation threatens that production,and an infestation would particularly hinder exports because other countries often restrict imports from areas.because many believe that california recent medfly outbreaks have been caused by the importation of infested fruit,it is unsurprising that california growers are wary of fruit brought from other parts of the world.at the same time,there are those who believe that the growers position is motivated as much or more by their desire to protect themselves against foreign competition in the dollar domestic produce market.
it is within that context that this case arises.in,medfly larvae were discovered in fruit imported from spain,specifically in clementines,a variety of mandarin orange.the department of agriculture promptly halted further imports of clementines from spain.several months later,the usda issued a rule that permitted the importation of spanish clementines to resume,subject to certain conditions intended to prevent the introduction of medflies into this country.domestic fruit growers challenged that rule by bringing this action.spanish fruit growers intervened in support of the rule,and both sides filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to the usda,thus sustaining the rule against the domestic growers challenge.see cactus corner,llc usda,d.
this appeal requires us to consider which requirements administrative agencies must satisfy in decisionmaking.the domestic fruit grower plaintiffs urge us to require agencies to articulate explicit standards,quantitative or otherwise,that would then be used to guide the agency decisionmaking process.specifically,plaintiffs argue that the usda must identify the level of risk it will accept in performing its duty to prevent the introduction into the united states of a plant pest,a,and that the department failure to do so violated the administrative procedure act apa.we are not persuaded.although a governmental agency must articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,it need not define an explicit standard to guide its decisionmaking.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,d quotation marks and citation omitted.because the government has cogently explain ed why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner,id.at,we can not conclude that the usda action in adopting the new rule was arbitrary and capricious.we also reject plaintiffs argument that the usda factual determinations are not supported by the administrative record.
background 
the facts of this case are fully set forth in the district court opinion,d at,and we summarize them briefly here.until,clementines were imported from spain under a permit authorized by e.the permit required that spanish clementines be subjected to a cold at a specified cold temperature for a specified minimum period of time.the cold treatment was designed to kill any medfly larvae before they reached the united states.importation continued without incident until november,when consumers and agricultural officials discovered live medfly larvae in spanish clementines at scattered locations around the country.id.at.
on december,the usda animal and plant health inspection service aphis temporarily suspended the importation of spanish clementines.the agency did so under the authority of the plant protection act,which permits the secretary of agriculture to prohibit or restrict the importation of any plant if the secretary determines that the prohibition or restriction is necessary to prevent the introduction into the united states of a plant pest.a.aphis quickly assembled a team that visited spain in.after identifying several possible causes for the appearance of medfly larvae,the team recommended that a systems approach be adopted.d at.under this approach,medflies would be subjected to multiple pest control measures,at least two of which have an independent effect in mitigating the risk of infestation.defining systems approach see also id.e requiring the secretary of agriculture to conduct a study of systems approaches designed to guard against the introduction of plant pathogens.
because of concerns about the effectiveness of the cold treatment protocol,aphis also convened a panel of experts to review the existing literature on the subject.the panel issued its findings on may.the panel concluded that the existing cold treatment protocol does not provide mortality,and even falls short of probit security.the panel therefore recommended revising the protocol by increasing the required treatment time at each temperature by two days.for example,while the existing protocol only required days of treatment at,the revised protocol called for days at that temperature.in addition to recommending this immediate revision,the panel stressed the need for research plans to verify the efficacy of the proposed new cold treatment parameters.
aphis further analyzed the cold treatment protocols in a study prepared by its office of risk assessment and analysis oracba.the oracba study provided a quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of cold treatment.the report agreed with the may study that the existing cold treatment protocol was inadequate,but concluded that the revised treatment protocol should achieve the probit level of security.
in addition to the cold treatment studies,aphis prepared a risk management analysis,which provided a more comprehensive evaluation of medfly control measures.the agency released the final version on october.this analysis assisted the agency decisionmaking process by estimating the likelihood that a mated pair of medflies could enter a region of the united states with a climate suitable for medfly populations.the agency focused on mated pairs because a single medfly can not cause much damage.unless a mated pair comes together in a suitable climate,there is little risk of infestation.
the risk management analysis evaluated the efficacy of the systems approach,under which two independent pest control measures would be implemented.one was the application of quarantine cold treatments such that probit mortality is approximated,as described above.the other was a management program designed to limit medfly populations within spanish orchards,prior to any cold treatment or shipment of clementines to the united states.
to determine the risk of medfly introduction,the risk management analysis used a model.these variables estimated the number of clementines shipped from spain the proportion of fruit infested with larvae the number of larvae per fruit that will develop into adults the mortality rate resulting from the revised cold treatment protocol and the proportion of fruit discarded in areas of the united states with climates.after examining these variables,aphis concluded that the proposed control measures would reduce the likelihood of medfly introduction to less than,or less than one in more than ten thousand years.even at the confidence level,the likelihood was only,or less than one in two thousand years.
meanwhile,in july aphis published a rule proposing that the importation
