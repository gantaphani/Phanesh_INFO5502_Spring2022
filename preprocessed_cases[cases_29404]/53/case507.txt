a group of domestic steel producers petitioners,including appellants bethlehem steel and steel group collectively,bethlehem,petitioned the department of commerce commerce to initiate an antidumping investigation of steel products steel from japan.the united states and bethlehem separately appeal from a final judgment entered by the united states court of international trade,in which the court rejected commerce application of partial adverse facts available invalidated a ordered the use of a particular weight conversion factor and affirmed commerce starting price for the steel sales at issue.because commerce decision to apply partial adverse facts available to the theoretical weight sales is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law,we reverse the court of international trade judgment to the contrary.because commerce methodology of calculating the starting price was not in accordance with law,we reverse the court of international trade affirmance of that issue.
background 
the underlying facts in this case are largely undisputed and are taken from the court of international trade decisions.see nippon steel united states,d.int l trade nippon i.on september,petitioners filed a petition with commerce pursuant to section b of the tariff act of,b,alleging that steel from japan and other countries was being dumped in the united states,injuring a domestic industry.on october,in response to the information presented in the petition,commerce published its notice of initiation of the antidumping investigation underlying this litigation.certain steel products from brazil,japan,and the russian federation.dep t commerce,initiation of antidumping invest.
commerce issued antidumping questionnaires to six japanese steel producers identified in the petition.because commerce could not examine all six,it selected nippon steel corporation nsc and two other producers as respondents and advised the remaining companies that they need not respond.see steel products from japan,dep t commerce,preliminary results.
from november,through january,commerce received responses to initial and supplemental questionnaires.questionnaire section b requested,among other things,figures that commerce could use to convert sales made at actual and theoretical weights,respectively,to a common basis conversion factor data.nsc,in a response dated december,did not provide that data,asserting instead that commerce did not need a uniform quantity of measure because all nsc quantity types are consistent within the product type.in its january,response to a supplemental request,nsc stated that steel sheet sold at theoretical weight,estimated weight,based upon dimensions are never actually weighed and,thus,nsc had no way of calculating the requested weight conversion factor.nsc later admitted that,contrary to its initial and supplemental responses,the actual weight can be calculated.
nsc timely reported its gross unit prices for sales in dollars.it also reported net prices in yen for each sale,which nsc and its customers derived by discounting the invoiced dollar amount by the standard discount rate,then converting to yen at the exchange rate applicable on the ninth day after shipment.nsc invoices reflect both the gross dollar price and the net yen price.commerce verified that nsc received payments in yen,and that nsc internally recorded the accounts receivable in yen.
on february,commerce published its preliminary dumping determination.preliminary results.at.among other findings,commerce preliminarily assigned an adverse highest calculated margin to sales made by nsc upon a theoretical weight basis because nsc did not provide conversion factors for these sales upon commerce request id.at.three days later,on february,nsc submitted a weight conversion factor with no explanation for its lateness.on march,nsc submitted changes and raw backup data supporting a corrected conversion factor.nsc stated that its prior misstatement that actual weights were unavailable was based on a factual misunderstanding on the part of the nsc staff responsible for the preparation of nsc responses in the instant investigation.because nsc had not timely provided weight conversion data,commerce informed nsc at verification that it would not accept or verify the conversion factor or supporting data.see steel products from japan,dep t commerce may,final results.
in its may,final determination,commerce reached a number of conclusions,two of which are pertinent to this appeal.first,commerce used the yen value listed on nsc invoices as the starting point for determining nsc prices,upon the ground that the yen figure was the value which is invoiced and paid by nsc customers.id.at.commerce converted this value to dollars at the exchange rate effective on the shipment date.see id.second,commerce confirmed its rejection of nsc conversion factor data and assigned a margin to the affected sales based upon facts available.see id.at.finding that nsc had failed to act to the best of its ability with respect to the conversion factor data because nsc could have provided it when originally requested,commerce drew an adverse inference in assigning that margin.see id.at.
bethlehem and nsc timely filed actions before the court of international trade contesting commerce final determination pursuant to a.the court of international trade remanded the case to commerce three times before entering final judgment.see nippon steel united states,d.int l trade nippon i nippon steel united states,d.int l trade nippon ii nippon steel united states.int l trade,nippon iii nippon steel united states.int l trade,nippon iv.in nippon i,the court vacated commerce decision to use adverse facts available against nsc and remanded the matter to determine whether the failure to timely produce the conversion factor data was an excusable inadvertence on nsc part or a demonstration of a lack of due regard for its responsibilities in the investigation.d at.the court also affirmed commerce use of the invoiced yen price as the starting price in its export price calculations.id.at.in nippon ii,the court held that commerce decision to apply adverse facts available on remand was not supported by substantial evidence because commerce failed to cite factors beyond nsc failure to respond correctly to the agency two requests for the weight conversion factor.d at.the court also held that a was not in accordance with law to the extent that it prohibited commerce from considering the untimely conversion factor data when evaluating the impact on nsc dumping margins.id.at.that regulation precludes the inclusion of material returned to a submitter in the official record of proceedings.the case was remanded for commerce to determine the dumping margin without using adverse facts available.id.at.in nippon iii,the court again remanded,holding that commerce calculations using neutral facts available resulted in an implausible conversion factor.nippon iii,slip op.at.finally,in nippon iv,the court found that commerce has not meaningfully changed its methodology as ordered.nippon iv,slip op.at.instead of remanding a fourth time,the court refuse d to further extend litigation by reopening the issue and ordered commerce to use nsc suggested weight conversion factor.id.at.
bethlehem and the government separately appeal to this court.both appellants argue that the court of international trade erred by rejecting commerce original determination to apply partial adverse facts available because commerce determination was supported by substantial evidence.both appellants also argue that the court erred in its conclusion that is invalid because commerce interpretation of that regulation is in accordance with law and entitled to deference.bethlehem separately argues that the court erred by holding that commerce determination of the starting price to be used for nsc sales was supported by substantial evidence.

discussion 
standard of review 
we review a decision of the court of international trade evaluating an antidumping determination by commerce by reapplying the statutory standard of review that the court of international trade applied in reviewing the administrative record.ta chen stainless steel pipe,united states,cert.denied,d.commerce special expertise in administering the law entitles its decisions to deference from the courts.see,micron,united states,torrington united states,see also chevron usa,natural res.def.council,d.we will uphold commerce determination unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i micron,at.substantial evidence has been defined as more than a mere scintilla,as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consol.edison nlrb.to determine if substantial evidence exists,we review the record as a whole,including evidence that supports as well as evidence that fairly detracts from the substantiality of the evidence.atl.sugar,united states.
imposition of adverse inference 
the first issue before us is whether commerce initial decision to apply an adverse inference in selecting facts available was supported by substantial evidence.appellants argue that commerce acted within its discretion because nsc had the ability to provide the conversion factor data requested in a timely manner and simply failed to comply.appellants contend that under the circumstances of this case,allows commerce to apply an adverse inference against respondents who fail to act to the best of their ability in complying with department requests.to the extent that the court of international trade required commerce to show that the failure to provide information was not inadvertence or a simple mistake,appellants complain that the court injected an element of intent not found in the statute.
nsc argues that the court of international trade properly rejected commerce interpretation of section.specifically,nsc supports the court conclusion and contends that the inquiry into whether a respondent has acted to the best of its ability requires a determination whether the respondent showed a lack of due regard for its responsibilities in the investigation.see nippon i,d at.nsc argues that commerce interpretation of the statute amounts to a requirement that responses to inquiries be perfectly compliant and that punishing respondents for inadvertent errors serves no legitimate purpose under the antidumping laws.
the parties frame the issue in this case as a dispute over the scope of the best of its ability standard in section.when evaluating an interpretation of a statutory scheme that an agency is charged to administer,we apply the familiar inquiry to determine whether to sustain an agency interpretation of that statute.see chevron,at.first,the court must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
turning to the words themselves,section provides 
a in general 
an interested party or any other person 
b fails to provide such information by the deadlines for submission of the information or in the form and manner requested,subject to subsections c and e of section of this title,
the administering authority and the commission shall,subject to section d of this title,use the facts otherwise available in reaching the applicable determination under this subtitle.
b adverse inferences 
if the administering authority or the commission as the case may be finds that an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information from the administering authority or the commission,the administering authority or the commission as the case may be,in reaching the applicable determination under this subtitle,may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available.
the statute has two distinct parts respectively addressing two distinct circumstances under which commerce has received less than the full and complete facts needed to make a determination.under subsection a,if a respondent fails to provide requested information by the deadlines for submission,commerce shall fill in the gaps with facts otherwise available.the focus of subsection a is respondent failure to provide information.the reason for the failure is of no moment.the mere failure of a respondent to furnish requested any commerce to resort to other sources of information to complete the factual record on which it makes its determination.as a separate matter,subsection b permits commerce to use an inference that is adverse to the interests of a respondent in selecting from among the facts otherwise available,only if commerce makes the separate determination that the respondent has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply.the focus of subsection b is respondent failure to cooperate to the best of its ability,not its failure to provide requested information.
the legislative history found in the statement of administrative action saa accompanying the uruguay round agreements act,stat.uraa,confirms the distinction between the two sections.prior to the adoption of the uraa,the tariff act mandated the use of the best information available if a respondent refused or was unable to produce information in a timely manner or in the form requested by commerce.in adopting the uraa,congress changed the terminology and noted 
new section a requires commerce and the commission to make determinations on the basis of facts available where the requested information is missing from the record or can not be used because,for example,it has not been provided,it was provided late,or commerce could not verify the information.
n ew section b permits commerce and the commission to draw an adverse inference where a party has not cooperated in a proceeding.a party is uncooperative if it has not acted to the best of its ability to comply with requests for necessary information.where a party has not cooperated,commerce and the commission may employ adverse inferences about the information to ensure that the party does not obtain a more favorable result by failing to cooperate than if it had cooperated fully.
saa at,reprinted in.thus,the legislative history mirrors the language in the statute by recognizing that commerce must use facts otherwise available when requested information is missing and commerce may impose an adverse inference after determining that a respondent has not been fully cooperative or has failed to act to the best of its ability in gathering information.
the statute does not provide an express definition of the best of its ability.none of the parties argue that the language is ambiguous.rather,they each dispute the plain meaning of the phrase.appellants argue that the statute requires commerce to determine the best of the respondent ability and whether the respondent has met that standard.nsc criticizes that test,claiming that it amounts to a perfection standard.we disagree.the ordinary meaning of best means one maximum effort,as in do your best.webster new collegiate dictionary.ability refers to the quality or state of being able,especially physical,mental,or legal power to perform.id.at.thus,the statutory mandate that a respondent act to the best of its ability requires the respondent to do the maximum it is able to do.
before making an adverse inference,commerce must examine respondent actions and assess the extent of respondent abilities,efforts,and cooperation in responding to commerce requests for information.compliance with the best of its ability standard is determined by assessing whether respondent has put forth its maximum effort to provide commerce with full and complete answers to all inquiries in an investigation.while the standard does not require perfection and recognizes that mistakes sometimes occur,it does not condone inattentiveness,carelessness,or inade
