in late,the department of commerce announced that it was changing one of the methods it uses to calculate whether imported goods are being sold in the united states at less than fair value,being dumped.commerce also addressed the issue of what dumping proceedings would be governed by the new policy,which generally made it more difficult to find dumping.when two companies found to have dumped in the present case hyosung d p co,and ehwa diamond industrial,argued that their case is among those governed by the new policy,commerce disagreed.we uphold commerce determination,because commerce spoke ambiguously on the timing issue in adopting its new policy and commerce reasonably resolved the ambiguity to exclude the present matter.
background 
commerce and the international trade commission share responsibility for investigations about whether an antidumping duty should be imposed on goods being imported in the united states,and they proceed in two stages first making certain preliminary determinations and then,for those investigations which proceed,making final determinations.see.commerce investigates and ultimately determines whether the goods at issue are being or are likely to be sold in the united states at less than fair value,as measured in various ways specified by statute,a.the commission determines whether a domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury,or whether establishment of a domestic industry is materially retarded,by reason of imports or sales for which commerce has made an affirmative determination,found dumping,b.the statute provides for issuance of an order imposing import duties in amounts keyed to the magnitude of the underpricing if both agencies make the specified affirmative final determinations against the imports,and it provides for termination of the investigation if either agency does not make those determinations,c see a,a.specified determinations of commerce and the commission are reviewable in the court of international trade,and then this court,a.
commerce sometimes determines whether dumping is occurring,and if so in what amounts,by examining certain pools of goods and calculating an average amount by which they are being sold at less than fair market value.before early,commerce employed zeroing in making that calculation for goods sold above fair value,commerce treated the sale price as being at rather than above fair value it zeroed out the margins above fair value.thus,commerce permitted no offset against sales in the calculation of the average,resulting in larger average dumping margins than if offsetting had been allowed.see union steel united states,corus staal bv dep t of commerce,advanced tech.materials united states.int l trade antidumping proceedings calculation of the weighted average dumping margin during an antidumping investigation final modification,final modification.
