in this copyright infringement case,we are called on to decide whether the iranian trade embargo,see part,prohibits the commercial importation of movies from iran,the copyright of such movies,or the assignment to a united states person of the exclusive rights to copyright,distribute,and exhibit the movies in north america.we answer no to each of those questions and,accordingly,we reverse.

discussion 
ieepa and the informational materials exemption 
the international emergency economic powers act ieepa,enacted in,gives the president the authority to investigate,regulate,or prohibit any transactions in foreign exchange upon declaring an emergency based on a foreign threat,a a.however,the president lacks the authority under ieepa to regulate information and informational materials 
the authority granted to the president by this section does not include the authority to regulate or prohibit,directly or indirectly 
the importation from any country,whether commercial or otherwise,regardless of format or medium of transmission,of any information or informational materials,including but not limited to,publications,films,posters,phonograph records,photographs,microfilms,microfiche,tapes,compact disks,artworks,and news wire feeds.
congress added the foregoing exemption for informational materials to ieepa in,in what is known as the berman amendment.see capital,brady,the berman amendment was designed to prevent the executive branch from restricting the international flow of materials protected by the first amendment.cernuda heavey,quoting,pt,at the berman amendment has been described as a reaction to several seizures by the united states of shipments of magazines and books from embargoed and to the treasury department restrictions on the permissible forms of payment for informational materials purchased from cuba 
the ieepa exemption was expanded in a amendment entitled free trade in ideas.the amendment expanded the exemption nonexclusive list of informational materials to include new media,such as compact discs and cd roms,and it clarified that the exemption applied to importation and exportation in any format or medium of transmission.the house conference report stated 
the language of the original exemption was explicitly intended,by including the words directly or indirectly,to have a broad scope.however,the treasury department has narrowly and restrictively interpreted the language in ways not originally intended.the present amendment is only intended to address some of those restrictive interpretations,for example limits on the type of information that is protected or on the medium or method of transmitting the information.
the committee of conference intends these amendments to facilitate transactions and activities incident to the flow of information and informational materials

b.the iranian trade embargo 
pursuant to his authority under ieepa,president clinton issued executive order and,in and respectively,to prohibit most trade with iran.fed.reg.may,fed.reg.the iranian trade embargo was intended to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,foreign policy,and economy of the united states presented by the actions and policies of the government of iran.exec.order,fed.reg.at exec.order,fed.reg,see also exec.order,fed.reg.at.as the fourth circuit has stated 
the obvious purpose of executive order is to isolate iran from trade with the united states.
executive order reflected the president appraisal of the nation interest in sanctioning iran sponsorship of international terrorism,its frustration of the middle east peace process,and its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.
united states ehsan,cir citing message to congress on iran,weekly comp.doc.
the president executive orders have largely been codified in the iranian transactions regulations,part,which prohibit,with few exceptions,the importation into the united states of any goods or services of iranian origin and any transaction or dealing in such goods or services,id.and.
notwithstanding their broad scope,however,the regulations permit trade in certain items through general and specific licenses,and they reflect the ieepa exemption for informational materials 
the importation from any country of information and informational materials as defined in,whether commercial or otherwise,regardless of format or medium of transmission,is exempt from the prohibitions and regulations of this part.
importation 
the first question that we must answer is whether plaintiff importation of the three movies ran afoul of the iranian embargo.it is clear from the text of the statute and regulation that the bare importation of a movie is permitted.b c.but,because plaintiff paid iranians for the movies that he imported,to answer our first question,we also must consider whether a commercial transaction that results in importation is likewise permitted.
the regulation provides,as relevant the importation from any country of information and informational materials,whether commercial or otherwise,is exempt from the prohibitions and regulations of this part.grammatically,the noun that the clause whether commercial or otherwise modifies is importation.this reading squares,too,with the statutory text from which the regulations drew the modifier.in b the ieepa phrase commercial or otherwise directly follows the clauses,and quite clearly modifies them.ehsan,at suggesting that the term exportation in the context of the iranian embargo,even without a modifier,implies trade or commercial activity.
we note that the result would be the same if the phrase whether commercial or otherwise modified,instead,information and informational materials.the importation of commercial materials,similarly,suggests that the materials will continue to have a commercial use after importation.
