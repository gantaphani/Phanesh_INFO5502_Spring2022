in july of,the united states department of commerce department issued a preliminary determination that fresh garlic from the people republic of china prc was being dumped into the united states.see.july,pursuant to its authority under the tariff act of,the department also issued a preliminary antidumping order imposing a duty of percent of the declared value of each shipment of garlic.id.at.to get their shipments of garlic,importers were required to post a bond or to provide a cash deposit.the preliminary order became final in november of.see.
incorporated in,universal fruits vegetable corporation universal was in the produce business,importing,among other things,garlic,ginger and shallots for resale in the united states.david pai initially ran the business by himself,but eventually his father,jason pai,came on to assist him.universal was informed of the antidumping duty by its customhouse broker due international.at the time the duty became effective,universal was expecting a shipment of garlic en route from china.universal never posted the duty required upon arrival under the antidumping order and ultimately abandoned the shipment.
soon thereafter,the government began investigating universal on suspicion that,unwilling or unable to pay the large antidumping duty,the company was transshipping its garlic via south korea so as to avoid having to do so.in june of,customs agents executed a search warrant at universal premises and seized various business records,among them several incriminating documents lending strong support to the government contention that universal was evading the antidumping duty by transshipping 
more than five years later on november,the government filed suit against universal,alleging that,on four separate occasions,universal had filed false customs documents indicating that south korea,rather than china,was the origin of the garlic it was importing.universal actions,the government alleged,violated the reverse false claims provision of the false claims act fca,which makes it illegal to make,use,or cause to be made or used,a false record or statement to conceal,avoid,or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government.a.as provided for under the fca,the government sought a civil penalty of not less than and not more than,plus times the amount of damages which the government sustain ed as a result of the false claim.a.the total value of the four shipments,as declared by universal,was.applying the percent antidumping duty to that declared value resulted in actual damages of,which,when trebled,totaled.on top of that,the government added four civil penalties of for each of the false customs declarations and a fifth such penalty for david pai alleged false statement to a customs agent.in total,the government sought in damages from jason pai,and from david pai and universal.
universal moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.with respect to the former motion,universal contended that,because the government claim concerned a customs matter,it fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of international trade.see the court of international trade shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action which arises out of an import transaction and which is commenced by the united states to recover customs duties.with respect to the latter motion,universal contended that,even if suit under the fca in district court were jurisdictionally sound,the customs duties sought by the government were not sufficiently definite to constitute an obligation under the terms of the fca.the district court denied both motions.
the government then moved for summary judgment based upon evidence seized in its search of universal premises and upon a series of declarations concerning that evidence.the district court granted the motion for summary judgment on december,and the next day entered judgment awarding damages in the full amount sought.universal and david and jason pai timely appealed.

in interpreting the predecessor statute to,we have held that 
it is that a means what it says the jurisdiction of the customs court is exclusive.even when other,statutes seem to confer concurrent jurisdiction on the district courts,the exclusivity of customs court jurisdiction reflects a policy of paramount importance which overrides the literal effect of other statutes.

the supreme court has nevertheless noted that congress did not commit to the court of international trade exclusive jurisdiction every suit challenging laws k mart cartier,d emphasis in original.rather,congress opted for a scheme that achieved the desired goals of uniformity and clarity by delineating precisely the particular matters over which the court of international trade would have exclusive jurisdiction.id.thus,d espite the fact that the customs courts act of broadened the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of international trade,it can not exercise jurisdiction over actions not addressed by a specific jurisdictional grant.trayco,united states.
the specific jurisdictional grant at issue,gives cit exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action which arises out of an import transaction and which is commenced by the united states to recover customs duties.that the first three elements of this provision are satisfied in the present case is undisputed.the central issue,then,is whether the government reverse false claims action is one to recover customs duties.
in support of its contention that the government claim here is,at bottom,a customs claim,universal notes that the measure of the government damages is essentially a tally of the duties it claims universal owed multiplied by three.because we have consistently rejected creative arguments presented in hopes of avoiding the exclusivity of customs court jurisdiction,cornet stores,at,universal contends that we must do so here as well.
