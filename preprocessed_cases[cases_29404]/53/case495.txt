standard of review 
customs classification is established by law.the court of international trade is required to decide,on a de novo basis,civil actions that contest the denial of a protest to a customs classification ruling.a the court of international trade shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced to contest the denial of a protest,in whole or in part,under section of the tariff act of the court of international trade shall make its determination upon the basis of the record made before the court in the following categories of civil actions civil actions contesting the denial of a protest under section of the tariff act of see jarvis clark united states,whether the court remands,conducts its own hearing,or simply examines the law and the tariff schedules on its own initiative,it is required to reach a correct result.
the first step in determining and applying the correct customs classification requires determining the meaning of any disputed terms in the relevant tariff provision.determination of the parameters of a customs classification under the htsus is a matter of statutory interpretation,and is given plenary review on appeal.the second step is to apply the provision to the specific imported merchandise,a question of fact that warrants appropriate deference to the finder of fact.see,sports graphics,united states,the ultimate issue as to whether particular imported merchandise has been classified under an appropriate tariff provision is a question of law which we review de novo.resolution of that issue entails a two step process ascertaining the proper meaning of specific terms in the tariff provision and determining whether the merchandise at issue comes within the description of such terms as properly construed.the first step is a question of law which we review de novo and the second is a question of fact which we review for clear error.citations omitted.
in united states mead,d,the court confirmed that customs classification rulings are not accorded chevron deference,see chevron natural resources defense council,d,because t he authorization for classification rulings,and customs practice in making them,present a case far removed not only from process,but from any other circumstances reasonably suggesting that congress ever thought of classification rulings as deserving the chevron deference claimed for them here.mead,at.
applying mead,customs rulings that are not the product of rulemaking as exemplified in united states haggar apparel,d,are nonetheless entitled to the deference described in skidmore swift.in skidmore the court held that the rulings,interpretations and opinions of the administrator under this act,while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority,do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.the weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.id.at.although pbs argues that even skidmore deference should not apply here because customs issued no formal decision when it classified this merchandise,and proffered no analysis until this litigation,we conclude that skidmore weight should be given to customs position.
thus on appeal to the court of international trade the importer burden of establishing that the customs ruling is incorrect,a,c,must be met in the context of the persuasive power of customs reasoning.see heartland,united states.upon further appeal to the federal circuit,the appellant bears the burden of establishing reversible error in the decision of the court of international trade,by showing that the court erred in its interpretation of the law,or that its findings of fact are clearly erroneous with due consideration to the appropriate level of deference.see bauerhin tech.partnership united states.
discussion 
at issue are articles of textile products imported by pbs from india,consisting of placemats,table napkins,table runners,and woven rugs called dhurrie rugs.many of these articles are decorated with holiday symbols,such as santa claus,christmas trees and wreaths,halloween ghosts,easter bunnies,and flag motifs.other articles are decorated in colorful designs or in solid colors that are often associated with holidays or seasons,such as red and green for christmas,and shades of brown and orange for autumn.pbs states,and presented generally undisputed evidence at trial,that all of the articles are imported and sold only in conjunction with particular holidays,such as christmas,thanksgiving,halloween,easter,and the fourth of july.the issue on appeal is whether some or all of these articles are classifiable as festive articles within the meaning of htsus heading for festive,carnival,or other entertainment articles including conjuring tricks and novelty jokes.also relevant is subheading for articles for christmas festivities,and subheading for other.
the customs service assessed import duties at the rates established in section xi textiles and textile articles under htsus headings and.the placemats and table runners were classified under subheading and the napkins under subheading the dhurrie rugs were classified under subheading.on appeal the parties stipulated that these articles are prima facie classifiable as textile articles under section xi.the court of international trade,applying midwest of cannon falls,united states,held that of the articles are also prima facie classifiable under chapter as festive articles,and therefore that they are subject to note t of section xi,which provides 
section xi,notes 
this section does not cover 
t articles of chapter for example,toys,games,sports requisites and nets 
section and chapter notes are not optional interpretive rules,but are statutory law,codified at.see libas,united states,describing chapter notes as statutory language of the htsus.the court of international trade held,and we agree,that note t requires that if the chapter exclusion applies,it is irrelevant whether the articles are also classifiable as textile articles.midwest of cannon falls,at note ij to chapter states that the chapter does not cover articles of chapter.accordingly,the issue here is whether the items at issue prima facie are classifiable under heading.if so,then pursuant to note ij,chapter,the items can not fall under chapter and must be classified under chapter.
in midwest of cannon falls the goods whose status as festive articles was in dispute were prima facie classifiable in chapter,which contained an exclusionary note in the same words as note t.among other items there at issue were ceramic mugs and pitchers in the shape of a.responding to arguments similar to those now presented,this court held that these items were classifiable as festive articles,even though they have a utilitarian purpose and prima facie fit another htsus heading.
the government again argues that chapter is limited to entertainment items,and that table linens and rugs can not be included in chapter because they are household goods.the government argues that decoration with holiday motifs does not make a festive article,and that since these goods are of a class or kind of merchandise dutiable as textile articles,and not of the class or kind contemplated as festive articles,these goods are not subject to the exception of note t.
in midwest of cannon falls the court held that classification as a festive article under chapter requires that th
