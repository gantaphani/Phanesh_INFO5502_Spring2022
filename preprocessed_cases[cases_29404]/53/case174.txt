this customs case concerns the classification of two chemical products,both stabilized forms of the compound carnitine,which were imported into the united states by sigma tau healthscience,sigma tau healthscience,llc sigma tau.united states customs and border protection customs or the government initially classified these products under a subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus that carries a duty.sigma tau protested,arguing that the products should be classified under htsus heading which encompasses provitamins and vitamins,subheading,a classification.
the court of international trade cit concluded that sigma tau products should be classified under a different subheading,making them ineligible for treatment.sigma tau healthscience,united states sigma tau,d.int l trade.on appeal,the parties agree that the only issue is whether sigma tau products are properly classified as vitamins under htsus heading.we agree with sigma tau that its carnitine products are properly classified under that heading,because carnitine is a vitamin in neonates.we therefore reverse and remand.
background 
customs classifications according to the headings and subheadings of the htsus determine the duties that importers must pay to the united states.the question here is the appropriate classification of sigma tau carnitine products.
carnitine is a naturally occurring amino acid derivative and an important nutrient in the human body,where it serves to transport fatty acids into mitochondria,the centers for energy production within each cell.our bodies obtain carnitine exogenously,from food,and also produce it endogenously,by breaking down and reforming protein.according to the webster comprehensive dictionary,an exogenous compound originates outside the organism,while an endogenous compound is one originating or produced internally.see exogenous,webster comprehensive dictionary int l ed.endogenous,id.stabilized forms of carnitine are formulated into tablets or capsules and sold as nutritional supplements they can also be incorporated into drinks,protein bars,and other products for human consumption.carnitine is sometimes referred to as vitamin bt for example,the online version of merriam webster medical dictionary identifies vitamin bt as a synonym of carnitine.while carnitine is an organic compound,it is not listed by name in any heading or subheading of htsus chapter,which covers organic chemicals.
sigma tau imports carnitine products into the united states.the two carnitine products at issue are acetyl l carnitine taurinate hydrochloride with silica,which sigma tau sells under the brand name l tauro,and glycine propionyl l carnitine hydrochloride usp with silica,which sigma tau sells under the brand name glycocarn.these products,white powders manufactured in italy,were imported in bulk.in,customs classified these products under htsus subheading,which covers prepared binders for foundry molds or cores chemical products and preparations of the chemical or allied industries including those consisting of mixtures of natural products,not elsewhere specified or included other other other other.that subheading carries a duty.sigma tau timely protested this classification,arguing that the products qualify as vitamins under htsus subheading,which covers provitamins and vitamins,natural or reproduced by synthesis including natural concentrates,derivatives thereof used primarily as vitamins,and intermixtures of the foregoing,whether or not in any solvent vitamins and their derivatives,unmixed other vitamins and their derivatives other other.that subheading is.
sigma tau brought suit in the cit,requesting that the court set aside customs classification decision and hold that the l tauro and glycocarn products are properly classified as vitamins under htsus subheading and,therefore,deserving of treatment.sigma tau also requested that the cit instruct customs to the entries for these products and to award damages for alleged overpayment of duties.sigma tau moved for summary judgment.the government for summary judgment,arguing that customs initial classification of the merchandise under htsus heading was erroneous but that htsus subheading covering quaternary ammonium salts and hydroxides lecithins and other phosphoaminolipids,whether or not chemically defined other,not,was in fact the proper classification.
the cit found that sigma tau products were prima facie classifiable both as vitamins under htsus heading and as quaternary ammonium salts under heading.sigma tau,d at.where an item is prima facie classifiable under more than one heading,the general rules of interpretation provide guidance as to which heading should be used.see dell prods.lp united states,fed.cir.relying on htsus general rule of interpretation gri,which specifies that when goods are,prima facie,classifiable under two or more headings t he heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description,htsus,general notes,at,the cit concluded that the term quaternary ammonium salts more specifically describes l carnitine than vitamins and thus that sigma tau products were properly classified as quaternary ammonium salts under subheading,sigma tau,d at.
the cit consequently granted summary judgment in favor of the government and denied sigma tau motion for summary judgment.id.at.sigma tau appeals,asking us to hold that the proper classification of its merchandise is under htsus subheading,as a vitamin.we have jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
the interpretation of the headings and subheadings of the htsus is a question of law,which we review without deference.deckers united states,fed.cir.see also airflow,united states,fed.cir.a classification decision involves two underlying steps determining the proper meaning of the tariff provisions,which is a question of law and determining which heading the particular merchandise falls within,which is a question of fact.deckers,at.we review questions of law de novo,including the interpretation of the terms of the htsus,whereas factual findings of the court of international trade are reviewed for clear error.id.at see also la crosse,united states,fed.cir.however,if there is no genuine dispute over the nature of the merchandise,the proper classification under which it falls is the ultimate question in every classification case and one that has always been treated as a question of law.bausch lomb,united states,fed.cir.see also med.grp.united states,fed.cir.
the government concedes that the cit erred when it applied the rule of relative specificity of gri to classify sigma tau products.the government acknowledges that note to chapter of the htsus chapter note is instead applicable.chapter note specifies that g oods which could be included in two or more of the headings of this chapter are to be classified in that one of those headings which occurs last in numerical order.htsus,ch,note,at.we have held that t he section and chapter notes of the htsus are not optional interpretive rules,but are statutory law.benq am.united states,fed.cir.internal quotation marks omitted.consequently,if sigma tau merchandise is prima facie classifiable as both a quaternary ammonium salt htsus heading and as a vitamin htsus heading,chapter note dictates that it be classified as the latter,as occurs last in numerical order.
thus,the only issue before us is whether sigma tau l tauro and glycocarn products are prima facie classifiable as vitamins under htsus heading.if they are,that heading applies if they are not,heading applies,as both sides agree that the products are prima facie classifiable as quaternary ammonium salts 
we first address the government contention that the products are not vitamins because they contain stabilizers.the two products at issue are stabilized forms of carnitine acetyl l carnitine taurinate hydrochloride with silica l tauro and glycine propionyl l carnitine hydrochloride,usp with silica glycocarn.the cit treated the products as equivalent to carnitine itself.at the cit,the parties agreed that this was the correct approach.the parties agree that the proper classification of the two products at issue hinges upon the primary and only active component of the products,l carnitine.sigma tau,d at.in its briefing at the cit,the government described l carnitine or carnitine as the only biologically active component of the two products at issue and indicated that the other chemical components serve merely as stabilizers,which render the two products at issue chemically neutral and stable.
on appeal,the government agrees that carnitine is the sole biologically active component of l tauro and glycocarn but now argues,apparently for the first time,that the court erred when it undertook a classification analysis of l carnitine only,and not the actual products in their imported condition,carnitine combined with stabilizing ingredients.appellee br.at.the government does not articulate a theory as to how the presence of any particular stabilizing component of l tauro or glycocarn,taurine,glycine,or silica renders the products.
the government argument comes too late and is therefore waived.our precedent generally counsels against entertaining arguments not presented to the district court.golden bridge,nokia,fed.cir.see also singleton wulff,d.furthermore,even if the government had properly raised the argument,the htsus forecloses it.htsus heading explicitly encompasses p rovitamins and vitamins and derivatives thereof used primarily as vitamins,and note f to chapter of the htsus expressly states that the headings of the chapter cover compounds with an added stabilizer including an anticaking agent necessary for their preservation or transport.htsus,ch,note f,at.
we thus agree with the cit that sigma tau imported products,l tauro and glycocarn,should be viewed as equivalents of carnitine.the proper classification of carnitine itself determines the proper classification of sigma tau merchandise.
chapter of the htsus covers organic chemicals.heading more specifically covers provitamins and vitamins,natural or reproduced by synthesis including natural concentrates,derivatives thereof used primarily as vitamins,and intermixtures of the foregoing,whether or not in any solvent.the terms carnitine and vitamin bt do not appear anywhere under heading or,indeed,anywhere in chapter.thus,if carnitine is classifiable as a vitamin under heading,it must be because it falls within a residual subheading,vitamins and their derivatives,unmixed other vitamins and their derivatives other other.
the cit construed htsus heading as,in relevant part,an eo nomine provision,a provision that describes an article by a specific name,not by use,see len ron,united states,fed.cir.sigma tau,d at.we agree with the cit that htsus heading should be treated as an eo nomine provision for purposes of this case the operative question here is whether carnitine qualifies as a p rovitamin or vitamin,items that are expressly named and covered by htsus heading neither party disputes this interpretation.because we conclude that htsus heading is an eo nomine provision with respect to vitamins,we need not consider the carborundum factors,which pertain only to certain use provisions of the htsus.see aromont usa,united states,fed.cir.grk canada,united states,fed.cir.
the first step in properly construing a tariff classification term is to determine whether congress clearly defined that term in either the htsus or its legislative history.airflow,at quoting russell stadelman united states,fed.cir.in this instance,there is no clear definition of vitamin within chapter or its legislative history.we have held that,
w hen,as here,a tariff term is not defined in either the htsus or its legislative history,the term correct meaning is its common or dictionary meaning in the absence of evidence to the contrary.we have explained that,to determine the common meaning of a tariff term,a court may rely upon its own understanding of terms used,and may consult standard lexicographic and scientific authorities.
id.at citation,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.to discern the common meaning of a tariff term,we may consult dictionaries,scientific authorities,and other reliable information sources.kahrs int l,united states,fed.cir.to the extent that dictionaries or other extrinsic references disagree with one another,a court may properly rel y on the definition most commonly found in the lexicographical sources to derive the common meaning of this term.len ron,at.
here the cit decision that carnitine is prima facie classifiable as a vitamin rested on the fact that carnitine is alternatively known as vitamin bt.t he court finds that since l carnitine is commonly known as vitamin bt it is prima facie classifiable in htsus heading.sigma tau,d at.similarly,the government argues in support of the opposite result that carnitine can not be a vitamin because many respected scientific sources do not include carnitine in listings of commonly accepted vitamins.the government notes,for example,that a national import specialist for customs testified with regard to sigma tau carnitine products that the fda does not indicate they vitamins,nor did the scientific literature he had reviewed.
whether a substance is commonly referred to as a vitamin may be pertinent,but only if there is a consensus as to the use of that terminology.see len ron,at holding that the common meaning of the htsus term vanity case should not be limited to cases that include mirrors,as the record showed that the public uses the term to refer to a variety of cases,with no consensus that the term requires that the case be fitted with a mirror nippon kogaku usa,united states,ccpa holding that a certain type of optical microscope should be classified under a particular tariff heading because,inter alia,the cit had found that without contradiction,industry,as well as ophthalmologists and optometrists,principal users of the merchandise,refer to it as a microscope or a,not as a compound microscope see also camelbak,llc united states,fed.cir.holding that how the subject articles are regarded in commerce and how the subject articles are described in sales and marketing literature can guide the court assessment of whether articles fall within the scope of an eo nomine provision.there is no such consensus here.we must,therefore,determine whether carnitine is a vitamin under htsus heading,applying the commonly accepted definition of the term vitamin.
indeed,htsus heading contemplates such an inquiry.by its very terms the heading covers not only approximately one dozen expressly named vitamins but also categories of further vitamins and their derivatives,including other vitamins and their derivatives other aromatic or modified aromatic htsus subheading and other vitamins and their derivatives other other htsus subheading.while explanatory notes to htsus headings are see infra the explanatory note to heading states in its list of products which are to be classified as provitamins or vitamins within the meaning of heading that t he list of products in each of the following groups is not exhaustive and that t he products listed are examples only.explanatory notes to the harmonized commodity description and coding system ed.en.explanatory note also includes a list of exclusions,products which,though sometimes called vitamins,have no vitamin activity or have a vitamin activity which is of secondary importance in relation to their other uses and thus are not classifiable under htsus.id.among the excluded products are various compounds whose names include the word vitamin,such as vitamin,vitamin,and vitamin id.carnitine or vitamin bt is not included among the exclusions.id.the note thus makes clear that the mere use of the term vitamin to refer to a particular compound is not conclusive.at the same time,the universe of compounds prima facie classifiable as vitamins under heading can not be limited to only those compounds that are explicitly listed under the heading.
we thus look to the definition of vitamin and ask whether carnitine falls within the definition.determining the proper classification requires first construing the relevant provisions of the schedule and then deciding which provision encompasses the merchandise at issue.del monte united sta
