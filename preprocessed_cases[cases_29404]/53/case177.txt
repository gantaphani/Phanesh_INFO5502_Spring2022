this case involves the department of commerce review of imports of lightweight thermal paper from germany between november,and october,the third year covered by an applicable antidumping duty order.in the review,the german firm papierfabrik august koehler se koehler was the only respondent.commerce discovered midway through the review that koehler had engaged in a scheme resulting in the omission of some sales from the information koehler had supplied to commerce,thereby altering the prices that are compared to prices to measure the dumping margin.because of that misconduct,commerce deemed koehler data unreliable and made adverse inferences against koehler.commerce adopted the highest dumping margin cited in the petition that launched the original investigation,relying for corroboration on sales data koehler had submitted in the review.see lightweight thermal paper from germany final results of antidumping duty administrative review,fed.reg.dep t of commerce.the court of international trade approved commerce determination.papierfabrik august koehler united states,supp.int l trade,motion to amend the judgment denied,supp.int l trade.concluding that commerce permissibly exercised its considerable discretion,we affirm.
acting under,in response to the request of appvion,formerly known as appleton papers,commerce initiated this third administrative review of its antidumping duty order covering lightweight thermal paper from germany on december.initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews and request for revocation in part,fed.reg.dep t of commerce.koehler responded to section a of commerce antidumping questionnaire on february,and sections b and c on their due date,february.koehler responses included aggregate information about the quantity and value of koehler sales,as well as a database of information about individual sales transactions.due to questions which ha d not been answered adequately,and areas where clarification of the submitted information was required,commerce issued a supplemental questionnaire on may.on may,appvion filed an affidavit from a confidential source asserting that koehler was engaged in a transshipment scheme,whereby it was shipping goods destined for its home market through other markets so that those sales would not be reported as sales to commerce.appvion also placed on the record certain sales data submitted by koehler in the second administrative review covering november,to october.
koehler requested two extensions of time to respond to the may supplemental questionnaire.on may,koehler sought a extension due to the temporary absence of key personnel,the time required to translate documents,and the difficulty of reviewing the many documents involved.commerce granted that extension due to the unique circumstances.on june,koehler sought a further extension to respond to the supplemental questionnaire and to allow outside counsel to investigate the transshipment allegations.commerce agreed in part,again citing unique circumstances.
koehler finally responded to the supplemental questionnaire on june,the new deadline.along with its response,koehler admitted that its employees had knowingly transshipped certain orders that should have been reported as sales,and it proffered an updated sales database that it alleged included those sales.although commerce accepted the supplemental questionnaire responses and allowed koehler to correct some inadvertent errors in the originally submitted data,it refused to accept the updated sales data that included the omitted,transshipped sales.commerce explained that the supplemental questionnaire had requested only clarification,not new data that koehler new data was untimely and that koehler had not shown good cause for extending the deadline for data submission.
commerce published its preliminary results on december,lightweight thermal paper from germany preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review,fed.reg.dep t of commerce,and its final results on april,lightweight thermal paper from germany final results of antidumping duty administrative review,fed.reg.dep t of commerce.in its april issues and decision memorandum accompanying the final results,commerce found that koehler had withheld information,failed to provide information in a timely manner,significantly impeded the proceeding,and provided information that could not be verified,and that koehler also had failed to cooperate to the best of its ability.on those bases,commerce invoked its authority under a and b,see statement of administrative action,vol,at,as reprinted in,deemed authoritative by d,and concluded that it would draw inferences adverse to koehler.
with respect to the data that koehler timely submitted,commerce found that t he extent of koehler material misrepresentation in this case rendered koehler questionnaire responses wholly unreliable and unusable.while commerce acknowledged that koehler took certain measures after the allegation was made by petitioner and acknowledged by koehler,it d id not find that such actions taken by koehler restore d its confidence in the reliability of koehler home market sales data submitted for this review,especially given the extent of the fraudulent activity involved in this transshipment scheme.commerce also noted that koehler did not reveal its transshipment scheme voluntarily it did so only after appvion may,allegation and that it believe d it unlikely that koehler would have provided information about the transshipment scheme and the omitted sales were it not for appvion allegation.
having rejected koehler data,commerce chose to adopt,as the dumping margin it would apply to koehler,the highest margin rate alleged in appvion petition.see b an adverse inference may include reliance on information derived from the petition.commerce then found corroboration for that figure in the fact that it fell within the range of margins calculated from data koehler had submitted in the second administrative review,where the margins ranged from less than zero to.see id.c providing that for secondary information like appvion petition,commerce shall,to the extent practicable,corroborate that information from independent sources that are reasonably at its disposal.
commerce explained that e did not require commerce to consider the updated information that koehler tried to submit.it found multiple reasons for that provision inapplicability first,koehler had not submitted that data by the deadline second,the data could not be verified and third,koehler had not demonstrated that it acted to the best of its ability in providing the information and meeting the requirements established by commerce.id.e.commerce also explained that it was not obligated to accept koehler updated data under d,which provides that commerce in certain circumstances shall permit a person to remedy or explain a deficiency.commerce noted that koehler deficiency was not due to an error or misunderstanding,but to intentional misconduct,which commerce gave koehler an opportunity to explain.
on april,koehler filed a complaint with the court of international trade to challenge commerce final results.on december,koehler moved for judgment on the agency record pursuant to court of international trade rule,which permits the court to enter a final judgment for either party without a trial.of int l trade b if the court determines that judgment should be entered in an opposing party favor,it may enter judgment in that party favor,notwithstanding the absence of a.the court sustained commerce determination and entered judgment for commerce on september.papierfabrik august koehler,supp.at.koehler moved to amend the judgment on october.the court denied the motion on january.papierfabrik august koehler,supp.at.
koehler appeals.it challenges commerce decision to disregard its original data commerce corroboration of the figure and commerce refusal to allow koehler to submit updated data after the deadline,which was the date on which appvion notified commerce of koehler transshipment scheme.we have jurisdiction under a.
we review commerce determinations applying the same standard to commerce actions that the court of international trade applies.apex exports united states,fed.cir.commerce decision is reviewed here to determine if it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i.
we see no reversible error in commerce determination to draw adverse inferences as to koehler without relying on koehler original,incorrect data.
where an interested party withholds information that has been requested,fails to provide such information by the deadlines for submission of the information,significantly impedes a proceeding,or provides such information but the information can not be verified,commerce may use the facts that are otherwise available to it to calculate an antidumping margin.a.if,in addition,commerce finds that an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information,then commerce may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available.b.the ability standard does not require perfection and recognizes that mistakes sometimes occur,but it does not condone inattentiveness,carelessness,or inadequate record keeping.nippon steel united states,fed.cir.the standard expects respondents to a take reasonable steps to keep and maintain full and complete records b have familiarity with all of the records it maintains in its possession,custody,or control and c conduct prompt,careful,and comprehensive investigations of all relevant records that refer or relate to the imports in question.id.
here,substantial evidence supports commerce decision to apply a.there is substantial evidence that koehler engaged in an intentional transshipment scheme that caused it to withhold certain information from its responses to commerce,an omission that impeded the investigation,and that it offered updated information only after the deadline for submitting data.commerce could properly find one or more of the conditions stated in a satisfied in this case.
substantial evidence likewise supports commerce decision to apply b.there is substantial evidence that koehler did not cooperate to the best of its ability.the kind of misconduct evidenced here is far from the cooperation that standard demands.see nippon steel,at.koehler attempts to pin the misconduct on a few errant employees.but commerce could find that koehler is responsible for the conduct of its employees and for the responses it provided to commerce.indeed,koehler and its outside counsel certified the accuracy and completeness of the original responses.thus,commerce was entitled to make adverse inferences.
commerce could also determine that koehler misconduct with respect to its sales undermined the reliability of its original data,so that commerce could disregard it as evidence of the lower dumping margins koehler urged,rather than undertake new inquiries to determine how to arrive at correct data.we have held that fraudulent responses as to part of submitted data may suffice to support a refusal by commerce to rely on any of that data in calculating the antidumping duty.ad hoc shrimp trade action comm.united states,fed.cir.approving a finding that the respondent credibility was impeach ed as a consequence of evidence reasonably indicating that the respondent deliberately withheld and misrepresented information,and these misrepresentations may reasonably be inferred to pervade the data in the record beyond that which commerce has positively confirmed as misrepresented internal quotation marks omitted quoting ad hoc shrimp trade action comm.united states,supp.int l trade.koehler has not persuasively shown why commerce could not take that approach in the circumstances of this case,where commerce reasonably found that koehler intentionally submitted materially false responses.thus,commerce could,in this case,find none of koehler original sales data so reliable or usable as to block an adverse inference.zhejiang dunan hetian metal united states,fed.cir.
we see no reversible error in commerce adoption of a rate from appvion petition,which commerce sufficiently corroborated using koehler own data which it could assume was not skewed against koehler.
under b,the petition is one source of information commerce may tap when drawing an adverse inference under b.the statute thus expressly permitted commerce to turn to appvion petition,and that authorization does not exclude petition numbers that are based on information other than the uncooperative respondent own sales.indeed,commerce asserts,without disproof from koehler,that commerce longstanding practice when making adverse inferences is to select the higher of the highest margin stated in the notice of initiation or the highest margin calculated for any respondent.
that is not the end of the inquiry.commerce must,to the extent practicable,corroborate that information from independent sources that are reasonably at its disposal.c both the authoritative statement of administrative action and a commerce regulation,in turn,declare that corroborating information means determining that it has probative value.statement of administrative action,vol,at,as reprinted in at corroborate means that the agencies will satisfy themselves that the secondary information to be used has probative value.d corroborate means that the secretary will examine whether the secondary information to be used has probative value.
the facts of which the figure being corroborated must be probative are the facts made relevant by the statute.we said in de cecco di filippo fara martino united states,fed.cir,that congress intended an rate to be a reasonably accurate estimate of the respondent actual rate,albeit with some increase intended as a deterrent to,not an unreasonably high rate with no relationship to the respondent actual dumping margin,and that commerce has wide,though not unbounded,discretion to select adverse facts that will create the proper deterrent to with its investigations and assure a reasonable margin.id.at.we reiterated those points in gallant ocean thailand united states,fed.cir,while also criticizing commerce for ignoring the respondent commercial reality.id.at.recently,we clarif ied that commercial reality and accurate represent reliable guideposts for commerce determinations,but t hose terms must be considered against what the antidumping statutory scheme demands.nan ya plastics united states,fed.cir.thus,a commerce determination is accurate if it is correct as a mathematical and factual matter,thus supported by substantial evidence and reflects commercial reality if it is consistent with the method provided in the statute,thus in accordance with law.id.at.
under those standards,commerce has satisfied the statute in particular,the figure it chose has probative value as to the combination of accuracy and deterrence our cases have discussed.the record here includes the data that koehler submitted in the second administrative review.commerce,looking at that data,determined that the rate it chose fell within the range of margins calculated in the second administrative review.the key graph koehler relies on shows that,while most sales in that dataset were made with margins between and,one sale showed a margin of almost,and one a margin of.commerce further found that t he margin calculation data from the second administrative review is relevant for purposes of corroboration because it is koehler own data and thus reflective of its commercial practices.in several cases,we have upheld commerce use of a party own data for corroboration,even where that data represents a small portion of the total sales available and supports a rate that is much higher than rates applied to the respondent in previous segments of the proceeding or to other respondents in the same segment.see pam,united states,fed.cir.upholding a dumping margin of based on sales made at margins higher than that,representing of pam total sales during a prior period,even after the court of international trade had previously remanded that same rate for corroboration because it had looked so high as to be punitive ta chen stainless steel pipe,united s
