in an unpublished opinion,the court of international trade formally reprimanded the appellant mikki graves walser,a department of justice attorney,for misquoting and failing to quote fully from two judicial opinions in a motion for reconsideration she signed and filed.we hold that we have jurisdiction to review that action,and affirm the reprimand.
in the underlying case,precision specialty metals,precision contested the decision of the united states customs service denying it drawback the refund of duties paid on imported products upon their subsequent export,see b.walser represented the united states in that case.precision filed a motion for summary judgment.under the court scheduling order,the government response and any were required to be filed by may.at on may,the government moved for a extension of time for such filing.walser stated during a subsequent court hearing that when she filed the extension motion,she had not started preparing the government for summary judgment.
on may,the court denied the extension motion and ordered that the government response to precision motion be filed forthwith.twelve days later,on may,the government filed its opposition to and its for summary judgment.two days later,the court struck from the record as untimely the government response and granted precision motion for summary judgment as unopposed.
the government then filed a motion for reconsideration,which contained the miscitations that resulted in walser reprimand.the document listed three names as the submitters,only two of whom signed it walser and the attorney in charge of the department of justice international trade field office in new york city.the third name on the motion was that of the acting assistant attorney general.walser stated that she wrote the motion.
a major argument the government made in support of reconsideration was that it had filed its motion for summary judgment in compliance with the order that it do so forthwith.the government relied on and quoted the following definition of forthwith in black law dictionary ed 
immediately without delay directly within a reasonable time under the circumstances of the case promptly and with reasonable dispatch.ex rel.carter jennings.within such time as to permit that which is to be done,to be done lawfully and according to the practical and ordinary course of things to be performed or accomplished.the first opportunity offered.
the motion stated that a review of several court decisions which construed the term forthwith revealed that there is no uniform definition of the term and that several courts have relied on the black law dictionary definition.it stated that t he term is clearly ambiguous and has subjective application.to support this contention,walser quoted from several judicial opinions.
the following table sets forth in the left column two of the quotations in the motion one in the text and the other in a footnote,and the right column contains the complete language of the pertinent portion of the opinion 
in dickerman,the supreme court stated 
but forthwith is defined by bouvier as indicating that as soon as by reasonable exertion,confined to the object,it may be accomplished.this is the import of the term it varies,of course,with every particular case.in matters of practice and pleading it is usually construed,and sometimes defined by rule of court,as within hours.
the omissions from the judicial opinions that walser quoted thus were as follows 
she omitted the sentence in mcallister that follows the sentence she quoted,referring to and quoting from the supreme court dickerman opinion.
the quotation in the footnote from justice thomas dissent left out,after forthwith,the limiting words as it is used in the saa suits in admiralty act,thereby making justice thomas statement seem broader than it actually was.she also left out his citation to dickerman.finally,she failed to state emphasis added for the quoted material in bold face,although she had so stated about the bold face portions of the quotation from mcallister in the text.this difference would lead a reader to assume that the emphasis in justice thomas dissent was provided by him,not by her.
at the oral argument on the government motion for reconsideration,the court questioned walser extensively about the foregoing omissions from the judicial opinions she cited and indicated its concern about her conduct.the court said it would issue an order to show cause to give walser an opportunity to discuss what it consider ed to be an egregious problem.
the court subsequently issued an order to walser to show cause why she should not be held in contempt by reason of misrepresentations in the government motion for reconsideration.it issued a second order to show cause why she should not be held in contempt by reason of the specific misrepresentations discussed by the court during oral argument on june,those misrepresentations including the omission of language in quotations from henderson united states,d and city of new york mcallister brothers,cir the failure to cite the court to dickerman northern trust company,and false implication resulting therefrom that a justice of the united states supreme court had stated the court had never undertaken to define the term forthwith,that according to that justice,its definition was limited to the terminology cited by defendant,and that the supreme court had not further defined the term,adversely to defendant position,in dickerman northern trust company.
at the hearing on the order to show cause,the court first indicated that it believed that the omissions from mcallister and henderson were an intentional attempt by competent counsel to mislead the court and that it would find that the representation to the court was in bad faith,and that as a result it was contemptuous.after a lengthy statement by and colloquy with walser,however,the court stated that it would not find her in bad faith and that she was purged of the contempt,but that it would take under advisement whether to find a rule violation or not.
in an unpublished opinion,the court held that walser had violated rule of the rules of the court of international trade,and formally reprimanded her.the court stated 
as counsel for the united states,ms.walser signed a brief before this court which omitted directly relevant language from what was represented as precedential authority,which effectively changed the meaning of at least one quotation,and which intentionally or negligently misled the court.that conduct is a direct violation of uscit rule.accordingly,a sanction under that rule is appropriate in this case.
in the concluding paragraph of its opinion,the court stated 
a n attorney before this court violated uscit rule in signing motion papers which contained.accordingly,the court hereby formally reprimands her.
the court determined not to impose monetary sanctions,because it concluded that the unpublished reprimand would be a sufficient deterrent sanction.
in the present appeal walser is proceeding pro se.she challenges the court of international trade determination that she violated rule and reprimanding her for that conduct.the department of justice,which had represented her before the court of international trade in responding to the order to show cause,has filed a brief amicus curiae in support of her,in which it argues that her conduct did not violate rule and was not sanctionable.
the first question is whether we have jurisdiction to review the reprimand of walser by the court of international trade.the answer depends upon whether that sanction,imposed as a sentence in the court unpublished opinion and unaccompanied by any monetary penalty,constituted a final decision of the united states court of international trade,which we may review under.this court has the duty to determine its jurisdiction and to satisfy itself that an appeal is properly before it.sanders,summagraphics.
in view engineering,robotic vision systems,a district court ruled that a lawyer had violated federal rule of civil procedure and was given a monetary sanction,but postponed setting its amount.this court h e ld that a district court decision imposing rule sanctions is not final,and hence not appealable,until the amount of the sanction has been decided by the district court.id.at.
this court has not decided whether a trial court formal reprimand of a lawyer in an unpublished opinion is a reviewable decision.some of the other circuits,however,have addressed closely related questions.
in walker city of mesquite,cir,a government lawyer peebles,who was no longer assigned to a pending case,appealed the district court sanctioning of him for improper litigation tactics.the court of appeals held that it had jurisdiction over the appeal even though the case had not been completed.in rejecting the contention that there is no article iii case or controversy,and thus no jurisdiction,because the only possible damage is to peebles reputation,the court pointed out that the lawyer 
was reprimanded sternly and found guilty of blatant misconduct.that reprimand must be seen as a blot on peebles professional record with a potential to limit his advancement in governmental service and impair his entering into otherwise inviting private practice.we therefore conclude and hold that the importance of an attorney professional reputation,and the imperative to defend it when necessary,obviates the need for a finding of monetary liability or other punishment as a requisite for the appeal of a court order finding professional misconduct.
id.at footnote omitted.
in united states talao,cir,the district court found that in conducting a criminal investigation,an assistant united states attorney harris had violated a state ethical rule rule prohibiting ex parte contacts with parties represented by a lawyer.in holding that it had jurisdiction over the attorney appeal from that ruling,the court of appeals distinguished cases discussed below holding that judicial criticism of a lawyer conduct was not itself appealable 
the district court in the present case,however,did more than use words alone or render routine judicial commentary.rather,the district court made a finding and reached a legal conclusion that harris knowingly and willfully violated a specific rule of ethical conduct.such a finding,per se,constitutes a sanction.the district court disposition bears a greater resemblance to a reprimand than to a comment merely critical of inappropriate attorney behavior.a reprimand generally carries with it a degree of formality.the requisite formality in this case is apparent from the fact that the trial court found a violation of a particular ethical rule,as opposed to generally expressing its disapproval of a lawyer behavior.further,the district court conclusion that harris violated rule carries consequences similar to the consequences of a reprimand.if the court formal finding is permitted to stand,it is likely to stigmatize harris among her colleagues and potentially could have a serious detrimental effect on her career.in addition,she might be subjected to further disciplinary action by the california bar.we have no reluctance in concluding that the district court finding of an ethical violation by harris is an appealable sanction.
id.at footnotes omitted.

sanctions are not limited to monetary imposts.words alone may suffice if they are expressly identified as a reprimand.
id.citations omitted.in weissman,the court agree d with the holding of williams that words alone will constitute a sanction only if they are expressly identified as a reprimand.at.
the seventh circuit,however,appears to have taken a different path.clark equipment lift parts manufacturing,cir,involved an appeal by a lawyer from an award of attorney fees by a district court made during a civil suit as sanctions for the lawyer misconduct.while the appeal was pending,the underlying case was terminated by a judicial decision of one part of it and the parties settlement of the remaining part.id.at.under the settlement,the parties paid all of the sanctions.id.the court of appeals held that the settlement mooted the lawyers appeal of the sanctions.id.at.it rejected the lawyer argument that it should also vacate the opinions of the district court,which were highly critical of the lawyer conduct and which,the lawyer asserted,harm ed his reputation.id.the court stated that it had already decided that an attorney may not appeal from an order that finds misconduct but does not result in monetary liability,despite the potential reputational effects.bolte home ins,cir district court found misconduct,but case settled before sanctions were imposed.id.
the foregoing decisions of the first,fifth,and ninth circuits have a common theme a trial court reprimand of a lawyer is immediately appealable,even though the court has not also imposed monetary or other sanctions upon the lawyer.this principle reflects the seriously adverse effect a judicial reprimand is likely to have upon a lawyer reputation and status in the community and upon his career.on the other hand,judicial statements that criticize the lawyer,no matter how harshly,that are not accompanied by a sanction or findings,are not directly appealable.
although the seventh circuit stated in clark equipment that an attorney may not appeal from an order that finds misconduct but does not result in monetary liability,despite the potential reputational effects,at,we can not tell whether that court would apply that principle where the attorney was actually reprimanded for the misconduct.when the seventh circuit decided clark equipment and the earlier bolte case upon which it there relied,it did not have the benefit of the analysis of the subsequent cases from other circuits that we have discussed above.
we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review the court of international trade formal reprimand of walser for attorney misconduct.the reprimand was explicit and formal,imposed as a sanction for what the court determined was violation of the court rule in signing motion papers which contained.the reprimand was part of a opinion that was issued in response to the order to show cause and that was directed only to that issue.the court found,as a basis for the reprimand,that walser signed a brief before this court which omitted directly relevant language from what was represented as precedential authority,which effectively changed the meaning of at least one quotation,and which intentionally or negligently misled the court.
as the other circuits have pointed out,a judicial reprimand is likely to have a serious adverse impact upon a lawyer professional reputation and career.a lawyer reputation is one of his most important professional assets.indeed,such a reprimand may have a more serious adverse impact upon a lawyer than the imposition of a monetary sanction.the trial court formal reprimand of walser had a sufficiently direct impact upon her that she should be able immediately to obtain appellate review of that action.
although the opinion that contained the reprimand was unpublished,that fact should not insulate the trial court action from judicial review.unpublished opinions,although not then reprinted in the west publishing company reports,may be,and frequently are,reported elsewhere.
similarly,the lack of a separate order containing the reprimand does not make it unreviewable.the court of international trade obviously intended its action to be a formal judicial stated that walser was formally that action was the completion and end of the procedure that the order to show cause had initiated.the court treated the sentence in its opinion containing the reprimand as its final judgment in the matter,and so do we.
nothing in this decision should be taken as suggesting,or even intimating,that other kinds of judicial criticisms of lawyers actions,whether contained in judicial opinions or comments in the courtroom,are also directly reviewable.
the court of international trade sanctioned walser for violations of rule of that court rules.that rule provides in pertinent part 
b representation to court.

int l trade.
court of international trade rule is identical to federal rule of civil procedure rule.hirsh,united states.it was obviously taken from the federal rule,and it therefore is appropriate to look to decisions under the latter in interpreting and applying the identical rule of the court of international trade.see id.unless otherwise indicated,rule refers to the court of international trade rule.
as walser recognizes,this court appl ies an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of a rule determination.cooter gell hartmarx,d.we uphold a rule sanction unless there is error underlying the lower court ruling.view eng g,at.an abuse of discretion occurs if the rule sanction rests upon an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.cooter gell,at.
walser does not challenge the court of international trade assessment of the evidence.she contends,however,that that court committed two errors of law in concluding that she violated rule.
walser first contends that the court did not follow the requirement in rule c b that to initiate itself a rule proceeding,the court must issue an order to show cause why the specific conduct did not violate the rule.she points out that the order to show cause issued related only to contempt,not to a rule violation.
as noted above,the court of international trade initially contemplated holding walser in contempt,and issued an order to show cause why that should not be done.that order described the specific misrepresentations upon which it was based,including the omission of language in quotations from henderson and mcallister,the failure to cite the court to dickerman,and the false implication resulting therefrom.walser does not contend that this order did not provide adequate notice of the charges she was required to answer.that it did give her such notice is shown by the fact that in response she filed a document that discussed in detail both the facts and the legal issues.
it was only at the conclusion of the oral argument on the order to show cause that the court indicated that it would not hold her in contempt and would take under advisement whether to find a rule violation.more than two months later,the court issued its opinion holding that she had violated rule and formally reprimanding her.
it is unclear what more walser would have had the court do.does she contend that when the court actually decided she had violated rule and that she should be reprimanded,it should have reissued the order to show cause,only this time addressed to rule and a reprimand instead of to contempt after it had issued such order,should it have held another oral argument walser describes the court failure to provide explicit notice that it was contemplating a rule sanction as a technical violation and she admits that,based upon the court statements at the hearing,she was aware that the imposition of sanctions was in the court mind.walser had full notice of the basis of the action the court ultimately took,and the court technical violation of the notice requirement of rule does not warrant setting aside the court sanction.
on the merits,walser contends her conduct did not violate rule.as noted above,that rule provides in pertinent part that b y presenting to the court whether by signing,filing,submitting,or later advocating a pleading,written motion,or other paper,an attorney is certifying that to the best of the person knowledge,information,and belief,formed after any inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,the claims,defenses,and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.
although the central purpose of rule is to deter baseless filings in district court,cooter gell,at,the scope of the rule is not that limited.as noted,it provides that by presenting legal documents to the court,an attorney is certifying her belief,formed after reasonable inquiry,that the claims,defenses and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or a argument to change the law.
the court of international trade stated that walser 
either willfully or through an unacceptable level of negligence,and the use of selective quotations and direct misquotation,concealed a supreme court case of which she was or should have been aware.counsel argument that the case was inapposite or dicta is simply irrelevant to this analysis her misconduct lies not in deciding the case was irrelevant but in attempting to conceal it from the court and opposing counsel.that,simply put,is a violation of any attorney fundamental duty to be candid and scrupulously accurate.emphasis in original.
the court concluded that walser violated rule because she signed a brief before this court which omitted directly relevant language from what was represented as precedential authority,which effectively changed the meaning of at least one quotation,and which intentionally or negligently misled the court.
we conclude that the court of international trade properly described and characterized walser actions and properly concluded that those actions violated rule.
in the motion for reconsideration,walser argued that the government filing of its for summary judgment twelve days after it was told to file forthwith satisfied that requirement.she began her argument with a quotation from black law dictionary definition of forthwith as including within a reasonable time under the circumstances of the case promptly and with reasonable dispatch.she then stated that the term has been defined by several courts based upon all,or portions of,the definition contained in prior editions of that dictionary,followed by quotations from two judicial opinions that included the dictionary definition.she also cited in a footnote the dissenting opinion of justice thomas in henderson,which stated the various dictionary definitions of the term.
walser did not cite or mention the supreme court dickerman decision,which stated regarding forthwith in matters of practice and pleading it is usually construed,and sometimes defined by rule of court,as within hours.at.the mcallister opinion included that quotation,and justice thomas dissent cited dickerman.
in his dissent,justice thomas also stated that a lthough we have never undertaken to define forthwith as it is used in the saa suits in admiralty act.henderson,at.thomas,dissenting.in her brief walser eliminated the words as it is used in the saa,substituting for that language.this omission,as the court of international trade pointed out,effectively changed the meaning of justice thomas language,and gave it a broader meaning t
