like many maritime cases,this case involves a vessel that sailed in and out of united states ports.and,like many maritime cases,because of the geographic scope of the high seas united states law may,in some cases,be applicable to transactions beyond our country territorial waters and borders.and,like many maritime cases,the suit here arose against the vessel while it was docked in a united states port.the question we consider is whether a foreign supplier,by supplying fuel to a vessel in a foreign port under an agreement that united states law applied to the transaction,may obtain a maritime lien under the federal maritime lien act,et fmla,on the vessel docked in an american port.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the vessel and its owner and against the fuel provider,holding that the fmla did not permit a foreign necessaries provider to obtain a maritime lien under the circumstances.based on the plain language of the statute,coupled with an enforceable choice of law clause,we conclude that a maritime lien arose under the fmla,and we reverse.
background 
splendid shipping sendirian berhad splendid is a malaysian corporation that owns the harmony container harmony,a vessel.in june,splendid entered into a with kien hung shipping company kien hung for a charter of the harmony.kien hung,a taiwanese corporation,operated the harmony in a loop from ports in north and south america to ports in japan,china,and korea.in particular,the harmony made regular stops at long beach,california,and manzanillo,mexico.
in early february,one of kien hung managers sought a price quote for fuel bunkers.the manager contacted an agent at yee foo marine industrial yee foo,who requested a price quote from asia,a singaporean entity.an employee for faxed a quote to the yee foo agent,who forwarded the quote to kien hung.the kien hung manager then faxed back an order to the yee foo agent,who forwarded the order to.in response,sent a email confirmation bunker confirmation to yee foo for the sale of metric tons of fuel bunkers to be supplied to the harmony at a cost of.the yee foo agent then forwarded the bunker confirmation to kien hung,which did not respond.
the bunker confirmation named kien hung shipping and the vsl,her master and owners as buyer,and as seller.it provided that t his confirmation incorporates seller standard terms and conditions dated january.pls inform us if you require a copy.kien hung did not request a copy.
standard terms and conditions are included in a document entitled the services group of companies general terms and conditions terms and conditions.the terms and conditions state that the general terms shall apply to every sale of marine petroleum products products entered into between a particular group company as seller seller and any buyer of such products buyer.
the terms and conditions also contained an incorporation and merger clause the confirmation and the general terms taken together,shall constitute the full agreement,and,particularly pertinent here,a choice of law clause,which stated 
seller shall be entitled to assert its lien or attachment in any country where it finds the vessel.each transaction shall be governed by the laws of the united states and the state of florida,without reference to any conflict of laws rules.the laws of the united states shall apply with respect to the existence of a maritime lien,regardless of the country in which seller takes legal action.
delivered the bunkers to the harmony in busan,south korea,in late february.in may,kien hung went bankrupt,and was left unpaid for the bunkers.hamburg sud,a german company,bought kien hung operations,took over the harmony charter,and continued sailing the vessel to long beach,california.threatened to arrest the harmony once it arrived at long beach,but the vessel insurers posted security to avoid taking the ship out of operation.
filed suit in federal court in los angeles,asserting a maritime claim in contract and in tort against the harmony,a maritime claim in contract against splendid,a claim for unjust enrichment against splendid,and maritime attachment and garnishment of the harmony and its bunkers the district court chose to resolve the dispute in stages.realizing that the choice of law issue was the foundational building block,the court first invited the parties to brief only this issue with respect to claims regarding a maritime lien and unjust enrichment.the court then decided that,under united states law,the choice of law provision was not incorporated as a term of the contract,splendid was not bound as a party to the contract,and malaysian law governed the contract.
in a later order granting partial summary judgment to splendid on its unjust enrichment claim,the district court informed the parties that it would reconsider its prior decision that united states law determined incorporation of the choice of law clause.the court ultimately granted summary judgment against on the grounds that malaysian law,not united states law,governed contract formation under malaysian law,the united states choice of law clause was incorporated as a term of the contract and could not obtain a maritime lien on the harmony because united states law denied maritime liens to foreign necessaries providers servicing ships in foreign ports.now appeals this decision,and splendid on the basis that the district court should not have applied the united states choice of law provision to the transaction in any respect.
during the flurry of summary judgment motions,filed an affidavit in which it expressed a need to conduct discovery to establish that splendid was a party to the contract and that splendid had participated in the bunker contract.the district court construed affidavit as a motion for additional time to conduct discovery under federal rule of civil procedure f,denied the motion,and later denied motion to reconsider its ruling.
terms and conditions included a choice of law provision that designated united states law as governing the existence of a maritime lien.that designation is particularly significant because the united states is one of a handful of countries that recognizes a maritime lien for the provision of necessaries william tetley,maritime liens and claims ed.tetley.splendid first line of defense is that the choice of law clause was not a part of the contract between and kien hung.alternatively,splendid urges that the maritime lien does not apply to the provision of necessaries by a foreign provider.our resolution of this appeal proceeds in three steps we determine the governing law with respect to contract formation applying the controlling law,we next determine whether the contract incorporates the choice of law provision and finally,if the choice of law provision is incorporated as a term of the contract,we evaluate whether acquired a maritime lien for supplying fuel bunkers to the harmony.
determining the law governing contract formation 
before we can determine the validity of the united states choice of law provision in the contract between and kien hung,we need to figure out which country law controls the issue of contract formation.because the availability of a maritime lien under united states law is the ultimate question,the temptation is to skip directly to united states law,as urged by.that approach,however,put s the barge before the tug.see denicola cunard line,cir.instead,we consider which country law governs the incorporation issue as if there were no choice of law clause.in other words,we can not rely on the choice of law provision until we have decided,as a matter of law,that such a provision was a valid contractual term and was legitimately incorporated into the parties contract.
both supreme court and ninth circuit law direct our analysis.we are guided by the principle that i n the absence of a contractual clause,federal courts sitting in admiralty apply federal maritime principles derived from the supreme court decision in lauritzen larsen,and its progeny.chan soc y expeditions,cir citations omitted.
in lauritzen,the supreme court identified seven factors which,alone or in combination,are generally conceded to influence choice of law to govern a tort claim the place of the wrongful act the law of the flag the allegiance of the injured party the allegiance of the defendant shipowner the place of contract the inaccessibility of a foreign forum and the law of the forum.at.we have added that courts should weigh and evaluate all relevant points of contact between the transaction and the sovereign legal systems that are affected by it,and not simply run through a mechanical analysis of the lauritzen factors.tento,at.accordingly,we also consider factors that of the restatement identifies as relevant where a contract lacks a choice of law provision,such as the place of negotiation of the contract,the place of performance and the place of business of the parties.see restatement second of conflict of laws gulf trading transp.v.the vessel hoegh shield,cir discussing factors where there was no choice of law clause.
in weighing all the points of contact implicated by the transaction,including the factors set out in lauritzen and the restatement,we agree with the district court conclusion that under maritime conflicts of law principles,malaysian law governed the contract formation.splendid nationality and the harmony flag are substantial contacts with malaysia that point towards malaysian law as the most appropriate for resolving this litigation.tento,at.no sovereign other than malaysia boasts such substantial contacts.that the bunkers were supplied in busan,south korea,was dictated in large part by the fortuity of the ship location and intended route.id.at.deciding which country constituted the place of contract or the place where negotiation of the contract occurred is a thorny inquiry,and does not weigh in favor of applying any one sovereign law,as the bunker contract was formed through a series of emails and facsimiles sent by and kien hung through yee foo,taiwanese intermediary,at a time when the harmony was docked in hong kong.to be sure,the singaporean nationality of,the injured party,is a relevant point of contact.however,standing alone,it fails to outweigh the nature and quality of the malaysian contacts the harmony malaysian flag and splendid malaysian nationality.
ii.applying malaysian law to contract formation 
malaysian law,which relies heavily on english law instructs us to examine the parties language and conduct in determining whether the parties intended to incorporate the terms and conditions into their contract,even though no copy of that document was exchanged in the flurry of emails and faxes that preceded the refueling.we conclude that the clear and specific language of the bunker confirmation,coupled with kien hung acceptance of the fuel bunkers without protest after receiving the bunker confirmation,reflect that the contract incorporated the terms and conditions as a matter of malaysian law.
the only relevant malaysian case makes that malaysian courts accord dispositive weight to the words and actings of the parties in deciding whether they intended to incorporate a clause.bauer sdn bhd daewoo,malaysian court of appeal mlj.in bauer,the malaysian court held that an arbitration clause from a previous work order was not incorporated into later work orders in part because there was an absence of the language that is necessary to reasonably support the finding of an intention to incorporate.id.
in addition,under malaysian law,a term may be incorporated not only by words but also by conduct.id.at.the court in bauer found instructive an english case involving the incorporation of disputed terms.id.citing british crane hire ipswich plant hire,eng.even though one party had not expressed assent to the terms,the common understanding which is to be derived from the conduct of the parties,the acceptance of goods without protesting the subsequently mailed conditions,indicated that those terms were incorporated into the contract.british crane,at.
here,both the contract language and the parties conduct support the conclusion that terms and conditions were incorporated into the bunker contract.the documents at issue are the kien hung order and the bunker confirmation.in response to kien hung order,the bunker confirmation email unambiguously stated that t his confirmation incorporates seller standard terms and conditions dated january.that language reasonably support s the finding of an intention to incorporate the terms and conditions.bauer,mlj at.
kien hung conduct also demonstrates that the parties intended to incorporate the terms and conditions.see id.kien hung neither objected to,nor requested a copy of,the terms and conditions after receiving the bunker confirmation,even though the bunker confirmation expressly stated,pls inform us if you require a copy of the terms and conditions.a kien hung manager received the bunker confirmation one week before kien hung accepted delivery of fuel bunkers in busan,giving kien hung sufficient time to request the terms and conditions,reject any or all of them,or change course entirely.the district court correctly concluded that under malaysian law,the parties language and conduct demonstrated that the terms and conditions,including the united states choice of law provision,were incorporated as a term of the bunker contract.
iii.giving effect to the united states choice of law provision 
having determined that the united states choice of law provision was a term of the contract,we address splendid argument that we should not give effect to that provision because the transaction is too foreign to apply united states law.to take splendid approach would steer us off course because it ignores both the principle of honoring the expectations of the parties to a contract and the scope of a maritime lien under the fmla.
recognition of the choice of law provision 
absent a strong showing that it should be set aside,the parties choice of law provision,as part of a freely negotiated private international agreement,unaffected by fraud,undue influence,or overweening bargaining power should be given full effect.bremen zapata,d.this presumption in favor of enforcing contract provisions encourages predictability in the law,particularly in the international arena.see restatement cmt.e stating that predictability is best served by letting the parties choose the law to govern the validity of the contract and the rights created thereby.
that this transaction involved multiple foreign points of contact does not dissuade us from recognizing the parties law and jurisdiction.in liverpool london protection indemnity association queen of leman mv,cir,the fifth circuit upheld a maritime lien asserted by an english insurer against a vessel whose insurance premiums had gone unpaid.even though the insurance contract was governed by english law,the court honored a provision in the contract that the insurer could enforce its right of lien in any jurisdiction in accordance with local law in such jurisdiction.id.at.by bringing suit in the eastern district of louisiana,the insurer was entitled to seek a maritime lien under the fmla,as united states law was the local law.the fifth circuit declared that there is nothing absurd about applying the law of the jurisdiction into which the ship sails,as the ship presence in the jurisdiction represents a substantial contact.id.at.
queen of leman thus counsels that where foreign parties have specified that they want united states law to determine the existence of a maritime lien in a transaction involving multiple foreign points of contact,and the ship has sailed into the united states,it is reasonable to uphold the choice of american law.that a maritime lien might exist on the vessel under united states law,but would not exist under malaysian law,was a consequence obviously contemplated by the contracting parties,and because the harmony sailed into a united states port,results in no fundamental unfairness 
we agree with the fifth circuit holding in queen of leman,but recognize that it is in tension with the second circuit view in rainbow line,tequila,cir.there,the court refused to apply a united states choice of law clause to decide whether a charterer was entitled to a maritime lien because application of united states law would have adversely affected the rights of a creditor.id.at.rather than apply the charter choice of law clause,the second circuit conducted a lauritzen analysis to determine which country law governed the existence of a maritime lien.id.at.it is worth noting that the adversely affected party involved in rainbow line was a lender to a subsequent owner of the vessel,an entity far removed from the original parties to the charter.for the reasons previously stated,we prefer the fifth circuit rule in queen of leman.
a canadian court that recently faced a similar choice of law provision and an array of foreign players applied the parties choice of united states law and recognized the existence of a maritime lien under the fmla.kirgan holding ship panamax leader,can,reprinted in.although canadian law has no precedential value here,the decision is instructive,particularly in light of the relatively uncharted waters presented by this appeal.the court upheld the parties chosen law,even though,as splendid would put it,all the points of contact involved were foreign the supplier was panamanian,the vessel was registered under the flags of malta and cyprus,the vessel owner was maltese,the charterer was caribbean,and the provision of fuel bunkers occurred in malta.the only contact that the transaction had with canada,whose law does not provide for a maritime lien for the supply of necessaries,was that the vessel was arrested in a quebec port.the canadian court concluded that the provision should be respected.id.we agree with that conclusion and now turn our focus to the fmla.
application of the fmla 
according to united states maritime lien law,a person providing necessaries to a vessel on the order of the owner or a person authorized by the owner has a maritime lien on the vessel and may bring a civil action in rem to enforce the lien.splendid siren song about the presumption against extraterritorial application of united states law fails to distract us from reaching the conclusion that the fmla plain language demands a maritime lien arose in favor of because it provided necessaries to the harmony on the order of the harmony charterer.charterers and their agents are presumed to have authority to bind the vessel by the ordering of necessaries.id.see also tetley at thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law ed.schoenbaum.as our decision rests in part on the unique nature of the remedy sought in this case,we offer a brief primer on maritime liens.
background on maritime liens in the united states 
a maritime lien is one of the most striking peculiarities of admiralty law,constituting a charge upon ships of a nature unknown alike to common law and equity.black law dictionary ed quoting griffith price,the law of maritime liens.it has been defined as a privileged claim,upon maritime property,for service done to it or injury caused by it,accruing from the moment when the claim attaches,traveling with the property unconditionally,enforced by means of an action in rem.id.quoting price at.the lien gives the creditor the right to appropriate the vessel,have it sold,and be repaid the debt from the proceeds of the sale.equilease,at.
the maritime lien serves the dual purpose of keeping ships moving in commerce while not allowing them to escape their debts by sailing away.id.in other words,a maritime lien may be considered a right based upon the legal fiction that the ship is the ship itself caused the loss and can be called to the bar to make good the loss.schoenbaum emphasis added.
the united states,through common law and statute,has long recognized and enforced maritime liens.id.as reflected in the earliest supreme court cases on maritime liens,this remedy was premised on concern for the vessel.throughout the nineteenth century,the court recognized that maritime liens could arise for the provision of necessaries in foreign ports,or ports that were not the vessel home port,in order to keep the vessel fit for sail.see,jago de cuba,wheat.stating that the consideration that controls every other is that t he vessel must get on the smith,wheat.conferring a lien on the vessel to ensured the continued maintenance of vessels by encouraging suppliers to provide necessaries in foreign ports.see the rumbell.observing that maritime liens for necessaries furnished to keep a vessel fit for sea took precedence over all other claims except seamen wages or salvage.
before,when the fmla was first enacted,an odd distinction existed in the american law of maritime liens a maritime lien arose for the provision of necessaries in a port in a foreign country or foreign state,but no lien arose if necessaries were supplied in the vessel home port.the roanoke.the smith,at.as a consequence of this anomaly,a lien on a vessel for the provision of supplies in a port of the vessel home state could arise only if there were state legislation to that effect.the smith,at.the significant variance among the state statutes was of concern to the supreme court.lucian ray,maritime contract liens,tul.in,justice bradley,writing for the court,hinted that congress might adopt a uniform rule for the whole country to govern maritime liens.the lottawanna,wall.bradley.
congress responded in by passing the fmla.act of june,ch,stat.the legislative purpose was to overrule the home port doctrine to nullify the doctrine that,when a vessel owner contracted in person for necessaries or was present in the port when they were ordered,it was presumed that the supplier did not intend to rely upon the vessel credit,such that a lien did not arise and to substitute a single federal maritime statute for the varying state statutes dealing with necessaries.piedmont george creek coal seaboard fisheries.see also dampskibsselskabet dannebrog signal oil gas.stating that the fmla purpose was to simplify and clarify the rules as to maritime liens as to which there had been much confusion.in addition,the fmla,by favoring suppliers regardless of where necessaries were provided,was intended to boost a faltering merchant marine industry.equilease,at.in effect,the fmla was intended to operate in aid of those who supply necessaries to ships and it correspondingly restricted the rights of the owners of the vessels.dampskibsselskabet,at.
in,congress codified the fmla as part of the ship mortgage act of,but the substance of the lien law was left virtually unchanged until.tetley at.under the original legislation,a vessel owner insertion of a no lien clause in the prohibited suppliers from obtaining a lien if a provider knew,or by exercise of reasonable diligence could have ascertained that no lien would be available.id.emphasis omitted.under the amendments,the reasonable diligence standard was dropped in favor of an actual knowledge standard.the legislation thus voids a no lien clause,as long as the supplier did not have knowledge of the clause,reprinted in.therefore,even though the between splendid and kien hung forbade kien hung from incurring liens on the harmony,that fact,standing alone,does not prevent from obtaining a maritime lien in this case,as nothing in the record indicates that knew of the provision.
in,congress repealed all previous maritime lien statutes and recodified the prior law on maritime liens as part of the commercial instruments and maritime liens act,stat.codified at et.congressional reports indicated that the new law was not intended to make any substantive changes to the fmla,and the lien provisions are still generally referred to as the fmla,reprinted in,tetley at.
application of the fmla 
the language of the fmla is clear and unambiguous 
a person providing necessaries to a vessel on the order of the owner or a person authorized by the owner 
has a maritime lien on the vessel 
may bring a civil action in rem to enforce the lien and 
is not required to allege or prove in the action that credit was given to the vessel.
the statute imposes no restriction on the nationality or other identity of the supplier or the vessel,and no geographic restriction on the place of provision of the necessaries.splendid endeavors to shoehorn the fmla into a narrower statute than it is by arguing that the fmla does not give a mariti
