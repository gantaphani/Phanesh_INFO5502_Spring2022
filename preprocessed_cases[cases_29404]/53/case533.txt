this case is before this court on remand from the supreme court of the united states.united states mead,d mead iii.in mead united states,mead ii,this court reversed the court of international trade affirmance of a tariff classification from the customs service customs.customs had classified day planners imported by mead corporation mead as bound diaries.in reversing the trial court,this court accorded no deference to the customs classification.the supreme court vacated the judgment of this court in mead ii and remanded because this court did not accord deference to the classification under skidmore swift.
in reconsidering the merits,this court applies skidmore deference to the classification ruling at issue.because customs classification of mead day planners within subheading of the harmonized tariff schedules of the united states htsus does not persuade under the skidmore standard,this court reverses.
at issue are five models of mead day planners model,and.the day planners differ from each other only stylistically based on size ranging from x to x,outer jacket cover material,and type of closure.the basic model contains a calendar,a section for daily notes,a section for telephone numbers and addresses,and a notepad.the larger models contain the features of the basic model with additional items such as a daily planner section,plastic ruler,plastic pouch,credit card holder,and computer diskette holder.a ringed binder holds the contents of the day planner,except for the notepad,which fits into the rear flap of the day planner outer cover.
in a january,ruling,customs classified the subject planners as bound diaries under subheading emphasis added 
customs original ruling offered little explanation for classifying mead day planners as bound diaries.after mead protested,customs issued a new ruling on october,with more detailed reasoning about the classification under subheading.this ruling is at issue in this case.
moving for summary judgment in the trial court,mead asserted both that its imports were not diaries and were not bound.either contention,if accepted,compels classification under the other provision of subheading.under that subheading,mead would owe no tariff on the imported articles,in contrast with the tariff assessed in customs ruling.in support of its motion,mead submitted dictionary definitions of the terms at issue,affidavits from seven individuals from the stationery goods industry,and affidavits from two bookbinding experts.the government for summary judgment in support of customs classification,offering its own definitions of diary and bound,and submitting supporting affidavits.
in a july,opinion,the trial court granted the government motion.the court of international trade broadly defined diaries as articles whose principle purpose is to allow a person to make daily notations concerning events of importance.under that definition,the trial court decided that mead day planners qualify as diaries even though they admittedly contain supplementary material elements such as a section for addresses and telephone numbers.with respect to the term bound,the trial court opined the common meaning of bound is fastened.the irrevocability of the fastening is not important so long as it goes beyond the transitory role of packaging.the trial court thus found that mead day planners,whose contents fit in a ringed binder,fall within that broad definition of bound.
mead argued for a different definition of diaries a book for recording a person observations,thoughts events.mead further contended that bound applies only when pages are permanently secured along one edge between covers in a manner traditionally performed by a bookbinder.reversing the court of international trade,this court held that mead day planners were neither diaries nor bound.mead ii,at.thus,this court concluded that the day planners required classification under the other provision of subheading.in reaching its conclusion,this court did not accord ordinary classification rulings the deference described in chevron,natural resources def.council,d.
the united states then petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court.the supreme court granted certiorari,d,to determine the limits of chevron deference owed to administrative practice in applying a statute.mead iii,at.at.the court held that classification rulings,although beyond the chevron pale,may merit some deference under skidmore.id.at.at.the court vacated and remanded the earlier judgment of this court with instructions to consider customs classification ruling under the principles in skidmore.id.at.at.
this court reviews the court of international trade grant of summary judgment without deference.sharp microelectronics,united states.where,as here,the parties do not dispute material facts regarding the imported goods,this court review of the classification of the goods collapses into a determination of the proper meaning and scope of the htsus terms,which,as a matter of statutory interpretation,is a question of law.see sgi,united states.
in keeping with the supreme court instructions in mead iii,this court affords a classification ruling deference in accordance with the principles set forth in skidmore.mead iii,at.at.under skidmore,a classification ruling receives a measure of deference proportional to its power to persuade.skidmore,at.that power to persuade depends on the thoroughness evident in the classification ruling,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,the formality attendant the particular ruling and all those factors that give it power to persuade.mead iii,at.at skidmore,at.in addition,customs relative expertise in administering the tariff statute often lends further persuasiveness to a classification ruling,entitling the ruling to a greater measure of deference.while this court therefore recognizes its responsibility to accord a classification ruling the degree of deference commensurate with its power to persuade,this court also recognizes its independent responsibility to decide the legal issue regarding the proper meaning and scope of the htsus terms.rocknel fastener,united states.
this court construes a tariff term according to its common and commercial meanings,which it presumes are the same.see simod am.united states.to discern the common meaning of a tariff term,this court consults dictionaries,scientific authorities,and other reliable information sources.see tower sons of buffalo,united states.
customs gleaned its broad meaning of diaries from three prior cases.in baumgarten united states,cust,abstract,the court considered a book,by,having pages for addresses and telephone numbers followed by ruled pages allocated to the days of the year and the hours of the day.calendars for the current and following months headed the ruled pages.the importer invoiced the articles as.in classifying them as diaries rather than as other blank books and slate books,the court looked first to the definition of a diary in webster new international dictionary of the english language ed.a register of daily events or transactions a daily record journal,a book for personal notes or memoranda,or for details of experiences or observations of the writer also,a blank book for daily memoranda.baumgarten,cust.at.based on this definition,the court decided 
t he particular distinguishing feature of a diary is its suitability for the receipt of daily notations by virtue of the allocation of spaces for hourly entries during the course of each day of the year,the books are designed for that very purpose.that the daily events to be chronicled may also include scheduled appointments would not detract from their general character as appropriate volumes for the recording of daily memoranda.
in brooks brothers united states,cust,the court considered an economist diary,a by spiral bound article,covered in red leather,with fine parchment.the importer did not dispute that the diary featured pages suitable for use as a diary,but argued that the diary also contained printed informational material such as maps and thus could not be classified as blank books,bound diaries.discussing baumg
