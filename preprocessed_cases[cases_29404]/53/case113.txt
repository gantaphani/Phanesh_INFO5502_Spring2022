in this diversity action,dependable highway express,dependable appeals from a district court order staying dependable domestic contract dispute against navigators insurance company navigators pending resolution of arbitration proceedings in england.we hold that the district court abused its discretion,and we remand for further proceedings.
dependable,a california company,operates a warehouse in los angeles and a fleet of trucks to service warehouse customers.navigators,a new york insurance company,issued indemnity insurance to dependable for the period of november to october.as the result of two cargo thefts in and,dependable incurred expenses totaling approximately for payments to the aggrieved customers,as well as claims defense costs,which it submitted to navigators for indemnification.when navigators refused to reimburse dependable,dependable filed a complaint in california superior court on january,alleging breach of the insurance contract.
shortly thereafter,navigators commenced proceedings in the high court of justice,queen bench division,commercial court,in london,england.navigators sought a restraining order against dependable to forbid dependable from proceeding with litigation in the united states.navigators asserted that dependable insurance policy was subject to the general terms and standard conditions of its columbus wording document,which designated english arbitration as the means for resolving disputes between the parties after hearing ex parte testimony from navigators english lawyer on two occasions,the english court granted an injunction and assessed court fees of roughly against dependable on march.despite navigators attempts to notify dependable of the english proceedings,dependable never appeared in england.
around the same time,navigators removed the california state case to federal court and answered dependable complaint.as an affirmative defense,navigators raised the english arbitration provision found in its columbus wording document.in response,dependable filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court vacated,reasoning that a motion for summary judgment was improper before discovery.
on may,navigators filed a motion to dismiss or stay the federal action in light of the english proceedings.dependable opposed navigators motion,claiming that the columbus wording and specifically the arbitration provisions were not part of dependable insurance policy because the schedules summarizing the policy key terms referred only to transport wording.thus,in dependable view,the difference between the words transport and columbus established that the english arbitration provision was not part of its insurance policy the district court granted navigators motion for a stay in a brief minute order that acknowledged the english court injunction and stayed the federal proceedings pending the resolution of the london proceedings,including arbitration.this timely appeal followed.
before considering the merits,we must first decide whether we have jurisdiction under to review the district court stay.generally,interlocutory orders are not immediately appealable.see restricting appellate jurisdiction to final decisions.however,in certain cases,an interlocutory order may be deemed final for jurisdictional purposes.see lockyer mirant,cir.we hold that we have jurisdiction under because the stay order puts dependable effectively out of court under moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,d,and idlewild bon voyage liquor epstein,d,and because the stay is an appealable collateral order under cohen beneficial industrial loan.
in moses cone,a federal district court issued a stay so that the parties could resolve an arbitrability issue raised in a concurrent state court action.at.relying on its earlier decision in idlewild,the supreme court concluded that the stay was appealable because there would be no further litigation in the federal forum and the state decision would be res judicata,leaving the defendant effectively out of court.moses cone,at.in idlewild,a federal district court stayed an action seeking to invalidate a new york law to allow the state court the opportunity to address the plaintiff various claims.at.notably,the court held that the stay was appealable despite the fact that the state court decision might not moot the federal proceedings.id.at.holding that idlewild was effectively out of court where the district court stay allowed the state court to address issues that would not necessarily dispose of the case see also lockyer,at even where the case might well come back to federal district court,idlewild liquor was effectively out of court for purposes of appealability of the stay order.
the stay in this case presents a strong likelihood that the english proceedings will leave one of the parties effectively out of court.if the english arbitrators decide in navigators favor,dependable will have little recourse back in the united states district court.see ministry of def.of the islamic republic of iran gould,cir the district court review of a foreign arbitration award is quite circumscribed.id.noting that the party challenging a foreign award bears a substantial burden because public policy in favor of international arbitration is strong internal quotation marks omitted on the other hand,were dependable to prevail in england,its domestic suit would be mooted,just as idlewild federal constitutional claims in the district court would have been mooted if the new york state courts had granted relief on grounds.lockyer,at citing terra nova ins.bar,cir concluding that the possibility that a stay would render a claim moot was equivalent to res judicata for purposes of applying moses cone.similarly,if the district court were to enforce the english court injunction against dependable proceeding domestically,dependable once again would be effectively out of court.
although the mooting of dependable federal suit is not a foregone conclusion,the stay order provides no indication that the district court clearly anticipated and intend ed that proceedings would resume after the stay has expired.lockyer,at emphasis added see also cofab,phila.joint,cir holding that moses cone does not apply where district court had no intention to deep six the suit.indeed,the stay order contains no detail as to what might occur back in the united states once english arbitration concluded.as a result,analysis under moses cone and idlewild confirms that the stay in this case puts dependable effectively out of court,and we have appellate jurisdiction to determine the propriety of the of whether the foreign proceedings actually moot the domestic litigation.see lockyer,at noting that absolute certainty is not required in order to put a party effectively out of court within the meaning of the moses cone doctrine.
even if the stay did not constitute a final order under moses cone,appellate jurisdiction is established under cohen beneficial industrial loan.in cohen,the supreme court concluded that under certain conditions a small class of collateral orders of the district court is immediately appealable.to fall within cohen ambit,an order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d internal quotation marks omitted.
following the supreme court lead in moses cone,the lockyer court buttressed its jurisdictional holding with an alternative analysis under cohen.at.the court held that the first cohen criterion was satisfied because,even though the stay order could theoretically be modified,the district court did not impose a time limit on the stay or note circumstances that might result in its modification.id.at citing moses cone,at.there is no basis to suppose that the district judge contemplated any reconsideration of his decision to defer to the parallel proceedings.burns watler,cir noting that there was no indication in the record that the district court would take further action.cohen first criterion is met here.as in lockyer,the district court did not impose a time limit or indicate that it might consider modifying the order.
cohen second criterion is also met.in applying cohen,the moses cone court held that a n order that amounts to a refusal to adjudicate the merits plainly presents an important issue separate from the merits.at.similarly,the district court order staying the federal action in light of the english proceedings was a refusal to address the merits of dependable breach of contract claims and related challenges to the arbitration clause found in navigators columbus wording.
finally,the stay satisfies cohen third criterion because the propriety of the stay will be unreviewable on appeal regardless of whether the english proceedings moot the domestic litigation.lockyer,at noting that even if the parallel proceedings do not moot the federal claim,the district court will lift the stay on its own and proceed with the suit,rendering review of the stay impossible.as in lockyer,if the english proceedings do not put an end to the cause of action,the district court will lift the stay and eliminate its reviewability.we therefore conclude that the stay is reviewable under cohen as a collateral order 
we review a district court stay order for abuse of discretion.see intel advanced micro devices,cir.however,the standard is somewhat less deferential than the abuse of discretion standard used in other contexts.yong ins,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.cooter gell hartmarx,d.
the district court stay order is extremely terse.it consists of four paragraphs and contains citations to only two cases landis north american,and leyva certified grocers of california,cir.the passages from landis and leyva in the stay order establish the general principle that a district court possesses the inherent power to control its docket and promote efficient use of judicial resources.see landis,at.t he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself,for counsel,and for litigants.leyva,at a trial court may,with propriety,find it is efficient for its own docket and the fairest course for the parties to enter a stay of an action before it,pending resolution of independent proceedings which bear upon the case.this rule applies whether the separate proceedings are judicial,administrative,or arbitral in character,and does not require that the issues in such proceedings are necessarily controlling of the action before the court.
however,while it is the prerogative of the district court to manage its workload,case management standing alone is not necessarily a sufficient ground to stay proceedings.see lockyer,at holding that a landis stay was inappropriate where grounds other than judicial economy were offered and found to lack merit.moreover,the district court overlooked certain restrictions on what otherwise might be an unfettered exercise of discretion.first,landis cautions that if there is even a fair possibility that the stay will work damage to some one else,the stay may be inappropriate absent a showing by the moving party of hardship or inequity.at.in this case,there is more than a fair possibility that the stay will work damage to dependable.forcing the company to enter into arbitration in a foreign country when it remains unclear whether dependable even agreed to arbitrate and where a foreign court has already levied legal and equitable penalties against it qualifies as a fair possibility of damage.moreover,navigators has failed to establish a sufficient case of hardship as the lockyer court noted,being required to defend a suit if the stay is vacated,does not constitute a clear case of hardship or inequity within the meaning of landis.at.
in addition,the landis court reversed the lower court decision primarily because the stay would result in undue delay.at.id.at.remanding to consider whether to grant a stay of what was likely to be fairly short duration.in leyva,the court expanded this reasoning,concluding that a stay should not be granted unless it appears likely the other proceedings will be concluded within a reasonable time.at.generally,stays should not be indefinite in nature.see yong,at requiring a strong showing to justify an indefinite stay.the order in this case provides no specific deadline for when the stay will terminate.in the nearly two years that have passed since the order issued,we have received no indication that any arbitration proceedings have commenced in alone concluded id.noting that a stay that terminated upon the resolution of an appeal could remain in effect for a lengthy period of time,perhaps for years if litigation dragged on.thus,in light of the general policy favoring stays of short,or at least reasonable,duration,the district court erred by issuing a stay without any indication that it would last only for a reasonable time.
because the stay is likely to do damage to dependable,and it is unclear when the stay might lift,if at all,the district court misapplied landis and leyva,committing an error of law which rendered the order an abuse of discretion.see lockyer,at noting the reluctance with which the appellate court questions the district court management of its docket but nevertheless concluding that a landis stay was improper.
having determined that the district court stated grounds for issuing the stay were erroneous,we next consider whether the stay nevertheless should be upheld under principles of international comity,as urged by navigators.see forest guardians forest,cir w e are free to affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record and briefed by the parties,and we are not limited to reviewing the district court stated basis for its decision.we conclude that deferring to the english proceedings as an exercise of comity would be inappropriate on the inadequate record before us.
comity is the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative,executive or judicial acts of another nation.hilton guyot.the term summarizes in a brief word a complex and elusive degree of deference that a domestic forum must pay to the act of a foreign government not otherwise binding on the forum.laker airways sabena belgian world airlines.comity is neither a matter of absolute obligation,on the one hand,nor of mere courtesy and good will,upon the other.hilton,at.indeed,
there are limitations to the application of comity.when the foreign act is inherently inconsistent with the policies underlying comity,domestic recognition could tend either to legitimize the aberration or to encourage retaliation,undercutting the realization of the goals served by comity.no nation is under an unremitting obligation to enforce foreign interests which are fundamentally prejudicial to those of the domestic forum.

laker airways,a seminal case on injunctions and international comity,involved an antitrust action initiated by laker against several domestic and international air carriers.id.at.in response to laker lawsuit,several of the foreign defendants sought an injunction in british court as a means to bar further domestic action.id.at.the british court granted the injunction,prompting laker to seek its own injunction in the united states.id.the district court granted laker injunction barring further british proceedings,and on interlocutory appeal the circuit held,in part,that the court was not bound by principles of international comity,id.at.the court noted that,w hen the availability of an action in the domestic courts is necessary to a full and fair adjudication of the plaintiff claims,a court should preserve the forum.id.at.moreover,domestic courts should be wary of enforcing foreign injunctions where the clear thrust of the requested relief was the termination of the united states claim.id.at.the laker airways court further emphasized that laker suit was first instituted in the united states,and thus the initial opportunity to exercise comity was put to the united kingdom courts.id.at.because the defendants claims of comity now as
