background 
octg are steel tubing products used in oil and gas drilling.chengde is a chinese producer and exporter of octg,and atp is the importer of record during the relevant period.in june,commerce initiated the first administrative review of the antidumping duty order directed to octg from china.initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews,fed.reg.dep t of commerce june,initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews,fed.reg.dep t of commerce,correcting the period of review.commerce selected chengde as a mandatory respondent.
because china is considered a nonmarket economy nme country,commerce selected indonesia,a market economy me country,as the primary surrogate country from which it would use surrogate values to ascertain chengde factors of production.certain oil country tubular goods from the people republic of china,fed.reg.dep t of commerce june,preliminary results.in the final results,as later amended,commerce assigned chengde a dumping margin of.certain oil country tubular goods from the people republic of china,fed.reg.dep t of commerce,final results,as amended by certain oil country tubular goods from the people republic of china,fed.reg.dep t of commerce.the appellants appealed to the trade court,raising three issues that are relevant in this appeal.we provide further factual and procedural background for each of those issues in turn.
steel billets 
the first issue pertains to commerce valuation of steel billets used in the production of octg.steel billets may be composed of carbon steel or the more expensive alloy steel.in its initial questionnaire,commerce requested chengde to d escribe each type and grade of material used in the production process.chengde responded that it consumed steel billets,and its counsel listed a harmonized tariff schedule hts subheading that covers products of alloy steel as the proper tariff subheading for its steel billets.
commerce then issued supplemental questionnaires,requesting sample mill test certificates for various control numbers connums.a connum is a code used to identify distinct products within the class of subject merchandise under review.chengde submitted the sample mill certificates.those certificates contained information on the chemical composition of the sampled octg,which constituted a portion,but not all,of octg sold in sixteen of nineteen sales made by chengde during the period of review.in addition,commerce requested clarification of the technical descriptions of chengde raw material inputs.chengde again responded with a general description of its steel billet input.
in the preliminary results,commerce valued steel billets using a surrogate value for alloy steel.chengde then argued that commerce should have used a surrogate value for carbon steel.chengde explained that its counsel prior reference to the hts number for alloy steel was an inadvertent error,and that it in fact used carbon steel billets.chengde called commerce attention to the mill certificates on the record,which showed that the tested octg were all made of carbon steel.
in the final results,as amended,commerce used a surrogate value,but only for the portion of octg directly shown to be made of carbon steel by the mill certificates.for the remaining octg,commerce continued to value the steel billet input using an surrogate value.
on appeal,the trade court remanded commerce selection of surrogate values for steel billets.for the sixteen sales partially supported by the mill certificates,the court directed commerce to explain whether chengde mill certificates prove the chemical properties of octg not specifically tested.atp i,wl,at.moreover,the court found that commerce had failed to consider a customs entry summary relating to an additional seventeenth transaction,which classified the octg as carbon steel.the court directed commerce to assess whether the entry summary proved that the octg sold in that transaction were carbon steel.id.
on remand,commerce explained that it was unable to conclude that the octg not specifically tested were necessarily carbon steel,noting the uncertainties in chengde sampling process and its failure to provide the requested technical descriptions of its steel billet input.commerce found,however,that the customs entry summary established that the entered octg were composed of carbon steel.commerce thus continued to use a surrogate value to value the portion of steel billets for which there was direct evidence,the mill certificates or entry summary,to show that carbon steel billets were consumed.as for the remaining portion of steel billets at issue,commerce used a simple average of the surrogate values for carbon steel billets and alloy steel billets.accordingly,commerce recalculated chengde weighted average dumping margin as.
the appellants again appealed to the trade court.the court sustained commerce remand results,finding that commerce reasonably chose to use a simple average of the surrogate values of carbon and alloy steel billets for the untested octg.atp ii,wl,at.the court agreed with commerce that octg under the same contract or connum could have different chemical compositions,id.at,and that chengde mill certificates lacked sufficient detail to establish that the untested octg were made of carbon steel,id.at.the court further noted that chengde could have shown that its billets were carbon steel by answering commerce questionnaires with exactness,but it failed to do so.id.
byproduct offset 
the second issue pertains to byproduct offset.the production of octg may generate steel scrap,which may be sold for revenue to offset the raw material cost for producing the octg that generated the scrap.in its initial questionnaire,commerce requested information on the quantity of byproduct produced,sold,reintroduced into production,or otherwise disposed of,as well as records demonstrating the production of byproduct during one month of the period of review.in response,chengde explained that it did not measure or record steel scrap production at the time it was produced,but rather measured the scrap quantity when it was sold.chengde provided the quantities of monthly scrap sales for the period of review.commerce did not request further information regarding scrap offset.
in the preliminary results and the final results,commerce declined to allow any scrap offset because chengde had failed to quantify the amount of scrap produced.on appeal,the trade court sustained commerce denial of scrap offset as supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law,finding that chengde had failed to meet commerce requirements to secure a scrap offset.atp i,wl,at.
international freight 
the third issue pertains to commerce valuation of chengde international freight expense.chengde reported that most of its octg exports to the united states were shipped by carriers based in south korea,an me country,and that it paid for ocean freight in dollars.chengde showed that it remitted the freight expense via a chinese freight forwarder,which in turn paid the chinese agents of the korean carriers,and those agents then paid the carriers in dollars.however,chengde did not provide any evidence on the a
