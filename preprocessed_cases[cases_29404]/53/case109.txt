appellant amar alghazouli alghazouli was convicted by a jury on five counts arising out of unlawful importation of freon,an substance.three counts counts,and charged alghazouli with violating.section prohibits fraudulent or knowing importation of merchandise contrary to law,as well as the receipt,concealment,or sale of merchandise,or the facilitation of the transportation,concealment,or sale of merchandise,which the defendant knows to have been imported contrary to law.the fourth count count charged alghazouli with conspiring to violate two money laundering statutes in violation of h.that count also charged,as a predicate offense for the money laundering offenses,a violation of.the fifth count count charged alghazouli with violating c,based on his having knowingly violated a regulation prohibiting the sale of freon to an improperly certified person.
alghazouli makes four arguments on appeal.
first,he argues that the term law,as used in the phrase contrary to law in,does not include a regulation.because all of the violations of charged in counts,and were based on violations of a regulation,alghazouli argues that he did not violate.
second,he argues that even if a violation of law for purposes of includes violation of a regulation,the jury was improperly instructed as to the elements of the underlying money laundering offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy charged in count.
third,he concedes that knowing violation of the regulation at issue in count is criminal,but he argues that he did not knowingly violate that regulation.
fourth,he argues that the district court erroneously applied a in imposing the sentence.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm alghazouli convictions and sentence.
background 
alghazouli and his two brothers,ahed and omran,were arrested and tried for activities involving the sale of freon unlawfully imported from mexico.alghazouli was tried separately.
witnesses at alghazouli trial testified that freon was purchased cheaply in mexico,brought into the united states without inspection,and then sold to automotive supply dealers.there was evidence that spanish text on the canisters indicating their mexican origin was removed before sale.one witness testified that in a canister of freon could be purchased in mexico for between and and then sold in the united states to automotive supply shops for to,well below the standard american price of to.
alghazouli brother ahed ran a wholesale automotive supply business.evidence at trial showed that ahed was involved in the importation of freon from mexico as part of his business.the government presented evidence that alghazouli was responsible for various activities connected with ahed business,that each of the three brothers involved was referred to as al,and that all three carried business cards for united auto supply,wholesale.four automotive shop owners testified that alghazouli was the al from whom they had purchased freon.
an undercover agent for the government testified that he telephoned alghazouli and requested freon,and that alghazouli did not ask if he had the certificate necessary to purchase the freon.he testified that when alghazouli delivered four canisters of freon to him,he explained to alghazouli that he did not have a license,and alghazouli responded,do worry about it.just do mention any licensing.he testified that alghazouli told him to play dumb if anyone asked him about a license.

iii.discussion 
we consider in turn the four issues raised by alghazouli in this appeal.
a.the meaning of the term law in 
alghazouli was convicted on three counts of violating and one count predicated on that violation.as stated,provides that anyone who fraudulently or knowingly imports or brings into the united states,any merchandise contrary to law,or receives,conceals,buys,sells,or in any manner facilitates the transportation,concealment,or sale of such merchandise after importation,knowing the same to have been imported or brought into the united states contrary to law,is subject to fine and imprisonment for up to twenty years,par.emphases added.see,roseman united states,cir.all four counts were premised on alghazouli violation of,a regulation promulgated under the clean air act,et.caa.section prohibits the importation of class i controlled substances.freon is a class i controlled substance.the question before us is whether violation of is a violation of law within the meaning of.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that congress intended the term law in to include a regulation when,but only when,a statute a law specifies that a violation of that regulation constitutes a crime.we further conclude that the caa specifies that violation of is a crime.we therefore affirm alghazouli convictions on counts,and.we also affirm his conviction on count,subject to our analysis in the following section concerning the jury instructions for that count.
plain meaning of law 
we begin with the text of.see carson harbor village,unocal,cir en banc w e look first to the plain language of the statute to ascertain the intent of congress.citations omitted.in common usage,the term law does not always,or perhaps even usually,include a regulation.the edition of black law dictionary defines law narrowly as a statute.but it also defines law more broadly as t he aggregate of legislation,judicial precedents,and accepted legal principles the body of authoritative grounds of judicial and administrative action,the body of rules,standards,and principles that the courts of a particular jurisdiction apply.black law dictionary ed.definitions in earlier editions of black are similar.see,black law dictionary ed.comparable definitions appear in webster third new international dictionary.we therefore conclude that the term law does not have a plain meaning that necessarily includes a regulation.
history of 
because law does not have a single clear meaning discernible from the text alone,we look to the history of.where,as here,different interpretations can be reconciled with the statutory language,our duty is to find that interpretation which can most fairly be said to be imbedded in the statute,in the sense of being most harmonious with its scheme and with the general purposes that congress manifested.united states pounds of salmon,cir quoting commissioner engle,d further quotation marks and citations omitted see also edwards aguillard,d the plain meaning of the statute words,enlightened by their context and the contemporaneous legislative history,can control the determination of legislative purpose.as the supreme court has stated,there is no fixed principle that a regulation can never be a law for purposes of criminal prosecutions.it may or may not be,depending on the structure of the particular statute.singer united states.
meaning of law in the,and tariff acts 
section is the latest version of a provision that was first enacted as section of the tariff act of.section prohibited the fraudulent or knowing importation of merchandise contrary to law,as well as the receipt,concealment,or sale of such merchandise or facilitating the transportation,concealment,or sale knowing the merchandise had been imported contrary to law.see,von cotzhausen nazro.quoting the version of the statute.
in the decades following the tariff act,the supreme court made clear in two cases that a criminal conviction for violating a regulation is permissible only if a statute explicitly provides that violation of that regulation is a crime.the first case,united states eaton,involved a violation of the oleomargarine act of.section of the act provided criminal penalties for anyone who shall knowingly or willfully omit,neglect,or refuse to do,or cause to be done,any of the things required by law in the carrying on or conducting of his business.eaton,at.quoting the act emphasis added.the defendant,a wholesale oleomargarine dealer,was convicted of a crime under section based on his violation of a bookkeeping regulation promulgated under section of the act,which did not specify that the violation of a regulation promulgated thereunder was a crime.the government argued that the word law in section included the bookkeeping regulation.the court emphatically rejected the government argument,writing 
it would be a very dangerous principle to hold that a thing prescribed by the commissioner of internal revenue,as a needful regulation under the oleomargarine act,for carrying it into effect,could be considered as a thing required by law in such manner as to become a criminal offence punishable under of the act,
it is necessary that a sufficient statutory authority should exist for declaring any act or omission a criminal offence and we do not think that the statutory authority in the present case is sufficient.

the second case,united states grimaud,involved a regulation promulgated under the forest reserve act.the act specified that the secretary of agriculture may make such rules and regulations as will insure the objects of such reservations and any violation of the provisions of this act or such rules and regulations of the secretary shall be punished as is provided in of the revised statutes.id.at.quoting the provision citations omitted emphases added.the defendant had violated a regulation promulgated under the forest reserve act.he argued,based on the court decision in eaton,that he could not be convicted of a crime based on the violation of a regulation.the court disagreed,pointing out that,unlike in eaton,the very thing which was omitted in the oleomargarine act has been distinctly done in the forest reserve act through the shall be punished language.id.at.see also loving united states,d quoting grimaud,at,to support the proposition that an agency can be delegated the power to define criminal conduct if congress makes the violation of regulations a criminal offense and fixes the punishment,and the regulations confin e themselves within the field covered by the statute.alteration in loving pappens united states,cir applying the grimaud approach.
in,the eighth circuit affirmed a conviction under section of the tariff act of,noting that the relevant statute criminalized violations of the regulation at issue.see estes united states,cir.the defendant had violated regulations promulgated under a statute governing the importation of livestock.the statute specified t hat any person knowingly violating the provisions of this act or the orders or regulations made in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars,or by imprisonment not more than one year,or by both such fine and imprisonment.estes,at quoting the statute emphases added.the court performed a careful analysis of eaton and grimaud,concluding that the defendant violations were contrary to law within the meaning of section of the act 
a s these regulations were fully authorized by law,and their violation made punishable by law,it must be held,we think,that it was proper to allege in the indictment that the cattle in question had theretofore been imported and brought into the united states from the republic of mexico contrary to law,as specified in the indictment,so as to bring the charge within the language of section of the tariff act.
section of the tariff act was reenacted almost verbatim in the tariff act of and again in the tariff act of see,united states mitchell,cir describing the reenactment history gillespie united states,cir noting that the and provisions are substantially identical.congress thus reenacted the provision that has become against the background of eaton,grimaud,and estes.that is,congress reenacted the provision knowing that a criminal prohibition against violating a law included a prohibition against violating a regulation when,but only when,a statute specified that a violation of that regulation was a crime.
patriot reauthorization act 
in,congress enacted the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of,stat.patriot reauthorization act or act.section of the act amended by increasing the maximum sentence under from five to twenty years,but otherwise left unchanged.section a of the act added an entirely new provision,now codified at.unlike the newly amended,which still prohibits only violations of law,the newly enacted prohibits the violation of any law or regulation,while otherwise tracking the language of 
the amendment of by section and the simultaneous enactment of in section of the patriot reauthorization act indicate that congress intended law,as used in,to include a regulation only if a statute specifies that the violation of that regulation is a crime.
sections and are closely related.both were enacted as part of the patriot reauthorization act and both are codified in chapter of title of the customs.both regulate movement across the borders of the united states.section addresses smuggling goods into the united states,and addresses smuggling goods from the united states.finally,b,specifying that the term united states has the meaning given that term in section.
the close relationship between and suggests that the term law in each has the same meaning.the statute presents a classic case for application of the normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.sullivan stroop,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.there is no indication that these terms are found in such dissimilar connections as to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in the different parts of the act with different intent.helvering stockholms enskilda bank.
moreover,uses the phrase law or regulation twice.the conjunction or indicates that law as used in does not include all regulations.if it did,the word regulation in would be superfluous.see,montclair ramsdell.it is the duty of the court to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute,avoiding,if it may be,any construction which implies that the legislature was ignorant of the meaning of the language it employed.the logical conclusion,based on the proximity of and,is that the term law in is not the equivalent of the broader law or regulation phrase in.see also.power.united states,cir when congress includes a specific term in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it should not be implied where it is excluded.sutherland,statutory construction ed.w hen the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another,the court assumes different meanings were intended.
conclusion 
we therefore conclude that the term law in does not include all regulations.the term includes a regulation only if there is a statute a law that specifies that violation of that regulation is a crime.we note that the only other modern court of appeals to consider the meaning of law in upheld a conviction for violation of a regulation,but on a somewhat different rationale.it held that regulations qualify as law only if they have the force and effect of law.see mitchell,at applying a test from chrysler brown,d.
alghazouli was charged in counts,and with violating.he was charged in count with conspiring to violate money laundering statutes,whose violation was predicated on a violation of.in all four counts,violation of was predicated on a violation of.section was promulgated under.section,part of title vi of the caa,authorizes the administrator of the environmental protection agency to issue regulations to phase out the use of substances.criminal enforcement of regulations promulgated under is explicitly granted in another provision of the caa,c,which provides a fine or imprisonment for not to exceed years,or both for a ny person who knowingly violates any requirement or prohibition of title vi relating to stratospheric ozone control,including a requirement of any rule promulgated or approved under such sections or titles,therefore,a violation of is a violation of a law within the meaning of,and we affirm alghazouli convictions on counts,and.
jury instruction 
alghazouli contends the jury instructions for count were fatally flawed.count charged alghazouli with conspiring to violate two money laundering statutes,a a i and a,in violation of h.alghazouli argues that the jury instructions for count did not sufficiently inform the jury about the nature of the offenses proscribed in these underlying money laundering statutes.the government contends that alghazouli was not entitled to an instruction describing the elements of the underlying money laundering offenses prohibited in a a i and a.in the alternative,the government contends that the elements of the underlying offenses were sufficiently described in the special verdict form read to,and provided to,the jury.
because alghazouli did not object to the jury instructions for count,we review them for plain error.united states marsh,cir,cert.denied,d.he must show that there was error,that the error was plain,and that the error affected his substantial rights.ching tang lo,at.even if he makes all three of these showings,we should exercise our discretion to reverse his conviction only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.
we conclude that the district court erred by not providing in the jury instructions the elements of the two money laundering offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy with which alghazouli was charged in count.however,we conclude that this was not plain error.the error was not plain in the sense of obvious.further,because the elements of the money laundering offenses were included in the jury verdict form,the error did not adversely affect alghazouli substantial rights.we therefore affirm alghazouli conviction on count.
count charged alghazouli with conspiracy under h.that section provides that a ny person who conspires to commit any offense defined in this section or section shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.count charged that the objects of the conspiracy were the two money laundering offenses set forth in a a ii and a.
it is that a trial court errs if it fails to instruct the jury on an element of a charged offense.see,united states gaudin,d.it is also that a trial court errs in a conspiracy case if it fails to instruct the jury on an element of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy.that is,if a jury is asked to determine whether a defendant conspired to commit an offense,the jury needs to know the elements of that offense.see,ingram united states,d ching tang lo,at evanchyk stewart,cir united states kim,cir see also united states lake,cir united states smithers,cir united states winfield,cir united states vaglica,cir.we note that,although the model jury instructions in the ninth circuit do not address the point,the model instructions of several of our sister circuits do.see pattern crim.jury instr.cir.a if the object offense is not charged and defined elsewhere in the instructions,it must be defined at some point in the conspiracy instructions.pattern crim.jury.instr.cir.similar modern federal jury similar,for the eleventh circuit.
in this case,the jury instructions for count informed the jury of the elements of a conspiracy under h.but the instructions omitted any description of the two underlying money laundering crimes that were charged as the objects of the conspiracy.further,the instructions omitted a description of the nature of the underlying crime from which the laundered money was derived,even though convictions under a a i and a require that a defendant know that the money used in a money laundering conspiracy derived from an illegal activity.we therefore hold that it was error for the trial court not to instruct the jury as to the elements of these underlying crimes.
plain error 
where jury instructions fail to describe an element of the,the elements of the offense underlying the error is plain.see,united states fuchs,cir.the facts of the case before us,however,are somewhat different.the district court did not read to the jury,as part of the formal jury instructions for count,any description of the money laundering offenses charged under a a i and a.but,as described in the next subsection,the court did read and provide to the jury a special verdict form for count,which contained the substance of those two provisions.
as we have stated in a somewhat different context,verdict forms are,in essence,instructions to the jury.united states reed,cir.in the circumstances of the case before us,where the substance of the two money laundering offenses was contained in the special verdict form that was read and provided to the jury,we are unwilling to conclude that the district court committed plain error in omitting this information from the formal jury instructions.while it was error to include the information in the special verdict form rather than in the formal jury instructions,it was not plain error.
because in this case the question of whether the error was plain overlaps to some degree with the substantial rights question,we proceed to the third stage of the plain error inquiry.
affecting substantial rights 
in the context of plain error review,for an error to affect substantial rights,in most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial.united states perez,cir quoting united states olano,d.the prejudice requirement applies in review for nonstructural error.united states dominguez benitez,d.to show prejudice,an appellant must show a reasonable probability that,but for the error claimed,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.quoting united states bagley,d.
when determining prejudice,we do not examine jury instructions in isolation.in some circumstances special verdict forms can cure problems created by defective instructions.see reed,at t he propriety of using a special verdict should be determined according to the particular circumstances of each case.quoting united states,cir maddox city of los angeles,cir jury instructions,when combined with the special verdict form,adequately set forth the relevant elements of a negligence charge.
count charged a conspiracy to engage in money laundering in violation of two substantive provisions,a a i and a.section a a i provides 
whoever,knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity,shall be sentenced to a fine or imprisonment.
the corresponding language of the special verdict form,which was read to the jury at the end of the jury instructions and was sent into the jury room afterwards,was as follows 
d o you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the object of the conspiracy was to,one,promote the carrying on of the unlawful activity,the sale of merchandise imported contrary to law,knowing the property involved in the financial transactions represented the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity 
section a provides 
whoever,in any of the circumstances set forth in subsection d,knowingly engages or attempts to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than and is derived from specified unlawful activity,shall be punished as provided,infra.
the corresponding language of the special verdict form was as follows 
do you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the object of the conspiracy was to,two,knowingly engage in monetary transactions in property of a value greater than and is derived from the unlawful sale of merchandise imported contrary to law 
in determining whether the special verdict form adequately informed the jury of the elements of the two underlying money laundering offenses,we must perform a analysis.this analysis is necessitated by the fact that the conspiracy statute depends on the money laundering crimes that are the object of the conspiracy.the money laundering statutes,in turn,depend on the crime from which the laundered money was derived.
first,we must perform the analysis required in any conspiracy case.that is,we must decide whether the special verdict forms adequately described the elements of the offenses that were the object of the conspiracy,to the degree that those elements are set forth in the text of the statute whose violation is charged as the object of the conspiracy.in this case,those statutes were a a i and a.as is apparent from a comparison of the language of these statutes and the language of the special verdict form,the elements set forth in the texts of a a i and a were sufficiently described in the special verdict forms.
second,we must decide whether the special verdict forms adequately described the nature of the underlying crime from which the laundered money was derived,and whether the forms adequately specified the mens rea of the defendant with respect to that underlying crime.both of the money laundering offenses that were charged as the object of the conspiracy require that the money be derived from illegal sources.section a a i specifies that the money be proceeds of unlawful activity a specifies that the money be criminally derived property and the product of unlawful activity.both sections also require that the defendant have some knowledge of the illegality of the activity.section a a i requires that the defendant be knowing a requires that defendant act knowingly.
it is obvious that a jury must be informed,in some manner,of the criterion or criteria for determining the illegality of the conduct from which the money is derived.if the jury is not so informed,there is a danger that the jury might be persuaded to convict even though the laundered money was,in fact,derived from legal activity.yet it is equally obvious that a full explanation of every element of the underlying crime that produced the money will not always be necessary.for example,in united states golb,cir,we held in a money laundering case that the jury did not need to be given an instruction on every element of the underlying crime from which the money was derived.we wrote,the jury was instructed as a matter of law that the manufacture,importation,and distribution of controlled substances is a specified unlawful activity,and that the government had to prove that at least some of the funds involved represented the proceeds of the manufacture,importation and distribution of controlled substances.t he jury did not need to be further instructed.id.at.
in this case,it is clear that the jury was adequately informed,both of the illegality of the underlying conduct and of the requirement that alghazouli knew of its illegality.there was no instruction directed to count comparable to the instruction in golb.but such an instruction was not necessary,for the underlying crime from which the money was derived was a violation of.violating was directly charged in counts,and.the jury was properly instructed on those counts,and it found alghazouli guilty.thus,when the jury found alghazouli guilty of conspiracy to engage in money laundering,it was well aware of the nature of the illegal activity from which the money was derived,because it already had convicted alghazouli for that activity.further,given the mens rea requirement for a conviction under,the jury concluded,when it convicted alghazouli on counts,and,that he knew that the money was derived from illegal activity indeed,his own illegal activity,thus satisfying the mens rea requirements of a a i and a.
knowingly under c 
alghazouli was convicted on count under c for violating m.as we noted,supra,the clean air act specifies in c that a ny person who knowingly violates any requirement or prohibition of subchapter vi of this chapter relating to stratospheric ozone control is guilty of a crime.section m is a regulation relating to stratospheric ozone control within the meaning of c.subject to exceptions not relevant here,it provides that n o person may sell or distribute,or offer for sale or distribution,any substance that consists in whole or in part of a class i or class ii substance for use as a refrigerant to any person.alghazouli was charged with violating this regulation by selling a class i substance to an uncertified individual for use in a motor vehicle.the district court instructed the jury as follows to establish a knowing violation of a requirement of the stratospheric ozone regulations,the government need only prove that the defendant had knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense not that the defendant knew his acts were unlawful.
alghazouli contends that he did not violate c because he did not know that his conduct was illegal under m.the government disagrees,contending that c requires only that alghazouli have known the facts that constitute the offense.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the jury was properly instructed.we therefore affirm alghazouli conviction on count.
the second,fifth,and sixth circuits have held that c requires only that the defendant have knowledge of the facts that constituted the offense.see united states ho,cir knowingly in c means knowledge of underlying facts,not law,particularly in the context of hazardous substances united states weintraub,cir the phrase knowingly violates in c requires knowledge of facts and attendant circumstances that comprise a violation of the statute,not specific knowledge that one conduct is illegal united states buckley,cir the prohibition in the version of c preceding the caa amendments requires knowledge only of emissions themselves,not knowledge of the statute or of the hazards that emissions pose.
in weintraub,at,the second circuit relied on the supreme court decision in united states international minerals chemical,d,in which a public welfare statute provided criminal penalties for anyone shipping acids who knowingly violates any regulation governing such transportation.see id.at.quoting f.the court held that the statute did not require knowledge of the regulation.rather,the court held,the statute required only knowledge of the fact that the shipped substance was acid.see id.at.w e decline to attribute to congress the inaccurate view that that act requires proof of knowledge of the law,as well as the facts,and that it intended to endorse that interpretation by retaining the word knowingly.the court reached this conclusion in part because where dangerous or deleterious devices or products or obnoxious waste materials are involved,the probability of regulation is so great that anyone who is aware that he is in possession of them or dealing with them must be presumed to be aware of the regulation.id.at.
we have not previously addressed the knowingly requirement in a,but we have interpreted an analogous provision in the clean water act,et.cwa.in united states weitzenhoff,cir as amended,we held that knowingly in c does not require that the defendants knew that their acts violated the permit at issue or the cwa.id.at.instead,the term knowingly requires only that the defendants knew the facts that constituted the violation.in so holding,we relied on the court decision in international minerals,just as the second circuit did in weintraub.we wrote that the cwa is a public welfare statute,a ca
