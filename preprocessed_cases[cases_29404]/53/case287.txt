the principal question is whether,after a north american free trade agreement nafta binational panel has invalidated a federal antidumping duty order and the department of commerce commerce has revoked the order,the invalidated duties that had been deposited prior to the date of that determination but that had not been liquidated,may be recovered from the united states by the depositors of those duties.the court of international trade sometimes trade court held that the government could not retain those antidumping duties,and that the depositors could recover them.we affirm.
a.a brief summary of the statutory and administrative provisions governing antidumping duties and their judicial review is necessary to understand our decision.
upon commerce finding that a product from a foreign country has been dumped,sold at less than fair value,in the united states and the international trade commission commission finding that such dumping has materially injured or threatened with material injury a domestic industry,commerce issues an antidumping duty order intended to rectify the unfair trade practice.b a preliminary dumping determination,final dumping determination a preliminary injury determination,b final injury determination.upon issuance of such order,the additional duties must be deposited with united states customs and border protection customs pending liquidation.id.a.liquidation means the final computation or ascertainment of duties on entries.
if a party to the antidumping proceeding so requests,commerce conducts an annual administrative review of the dumping margins for the product.a.a request for such review suspends liquidation of the duties while such review takes place.a c see also int l trading united states,c.
similar provisions also cover countervailing duty orders,which are issued when a foreign government has subsidized sales in the united states.the same legal principles govern such duties.although this case involves both types of duties,we do not discuss them separately and refer to them collectively as antidumping duties.
someone wishing to challenge an antidumping duty order has a choice of two methods of doing so.in any case,suit may be brought before the court of international trade.c b.the trade court may enjoin liquidation of duties pending its decision.c.
if the dumped goods originated in mexico or canada,however,the antidumping order may be challenged before a nafta binational panel.g.in certain circumstances,liquidation of entries may be suspended pending review by a nafta panel.g.
congress has implemented both the nafta agreement and its predecessor through enacting legislation.see united states canada free trade agreement implementation act of,stat.nafta implementation act of,stat.among other things,these statutes amended section of the tariff act of,which governs judicial review of antidumping challenges.
b.in commerce,acting in response to a petition by the united states domestic wheat industry,found that canadian wheat had been sold in the united states at less than fair value.canadian wheat bd.united states,d.int l trade hereinafter canadian wheat bd.ii.the commission determined that the dumping of the wheat had materially injured the united states domestic wheat industry.durum and hard red spring wheat from canada,inv.ta and and ta and,usitc pub.commerce then issued an antidumping order.notice of antidumping duty order hard red spring wheat from canada.
the present case involves canadian wheat that entered the united states in,subject to commerce antidumping duty order.canadian wheat bd.united states,d.int l trade hereinafter canadian wheat bd.i.the appellee canadian wheat board deposited the antidumping duties on the entries.liquidation of those duties was suspended when canadian wheat board subsequently requested an annual administrative review thereof.id.
the canadians challenged the commission injury determination before a nafta binational panel,which found that there was not substantial evidence in the record that the dumping had materially injured the domestic wheat industry,and remanded the case to the commission for further consideration.in the matter of hard red spring wheat from canada,usa cda june.on remand,the commission found that the domestic industry was not materially injured by the importation of the canadian wheat.hard spring wheat from canada,inv.ta and ta,usitc pub.the domestic wheat industry challenged the commission,but a nafta panel affirmed the finding,effective january.in the matter of hard red spring wheat from canada,usa cda.
commerce then revoked the antidumping duty order.revocation of countervailing and antidumping duty orders.dep t of commerce.commerce instructed customs to terminate the suspension of liquidation of hard red spring wheat from canada and cease collection of cash deposits as of january.commerce stated,however,that the revocation does not affect the liquidation of entries made prior to january,and instructed customs to liquidate those earlier entries at the rate in effect at the time of entry.
canadian wheat board filed suit in the court of international trade to enjoin commerce from liquidating the antidumping duties on its wheat imported prior to january.canadian wheat bd.i,d at.it also sought the return of those deposited duties.canadian wheat bd.ii,d at.after filing suit,canadian wheat board withdrew its request for an administrative review by commerce.canadian wheat bd.i,d at.
the trade court granted a preliminary injunction against liquidation of those duties.id.at.on the merits,the trade court,after concluding that it had jurisdiction over the case,granted summary judgment for canadian wheat board,holding that it was entitled to the return of its deposited unliquidated antidumping duties.canadian wheat bd.ii,d at.the court reasoned that because the entries were suspended and unliquidated when the antidumping duty order was revoked,they should not be subjected to those orders.id.at.the court clarified portions of its decision in an opinion denying reconsideration.canadian wheat bd.united states,d,hereinafter canadian wheat bd.iii.
the court judgment directed commerce to instruct customs to liquidate all unliquidated entries of the canadian wheat covered without regard to antidumping and countervailing duties,and refund all antidumping and countervailing duty cash deposits on all unliquidated entries of the canadian wheat made on or before january.
the government contends that the present action is an attempt to obtain judicial review of or to enforce a nafta panel decision and that the relevant statutes prohibit such a suit.the canadian wheat board,however,is not challenging or seeking to enforce the nafta panel decision in which it prevailed.its complaint is about commerce implementation of that decision.the challenge here is to the action of commerce,not to that of the panel,and that is a challenge that may be properly made.
the question on the merits is whether,after commerce has revoked an antidumping duty order following a nafta panel determination that the commission injury determination upon which that order was based was invalid,commerce may retain antidumping duties that had been deposited before the date of the nafta panel decision but were still unliquidated.the answer is no.
after the nafta panel issued its final order affirming the commission remand finding that the dumping had not materially injured the united states wheat industry,commerce 
revoked the antidumping duty order and 
terminated the imposition and collection of antidumping duties on future importations of the canadian wheat but 
proposed to retain and refused to return the antidumping duties the canadians had previously deposited pursuant to the antidumping duty order that had been revoked because it turned out to have been erroneously issued.
the third action is so bizarre and unfair that we would be most reluctant to sustain it unless we could say with complete assurance that there was no doubt that congress intended that result.our analysis of the governing statutes and regulatory provisions indicates that congress intended that foreign sellers in the canadians position could r
