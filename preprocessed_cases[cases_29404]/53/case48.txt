the arms export control act aeca,authorizes the president to control,inter alia,the export and import of defense articles.id.a.the department of state,exercising this authority for the president,has promulgated the international traffic in arms regulations itar.these regulations include the munitions list,which consists of categories of military items that can not be exported without a license issued by the department of state office of defense trade controls.because the united states maintains an arms embargo with the people republic of china,no license to ship items on the munitions list to the people republic of china can be acquired.a willful violation of the aeca or its implementing regulations subjects an offender to criminal sanctions.c.
when a united states military unit determines that a piece of military property,including an item on the munitions list,is obsolete,in a condition that is no longer repairable,or in excess,the military unit turns the property over to the defense reutilization and marketing service drms,an agency operated by the department of defense.once the military property is turned over to the drms,the drms offers it to other military units.if no other military unit is interested,the military property is offered to federal agencies,state agencies,and organizations.if there are no federal agencies,state agencies,or organizations interested in the military property,the military property is offered for sale,sometimes labeled as scrap,to the general public through a national sales program.often,multiple pieces of military property are offered for sale in lots.
through its national sales program,the drms issues invitations for bid to prospective purchasers.an invitation for bid contains a description of the items for sale,the terms and conditions of sale,a bid sheet,and an end use certificate the invitation for bid also indicates whether a particular lot contains items on the munitions list.importantly,even if a particular lot designates the military property as scrap,the invitation for bid will indicate whether the lot contains items on the munitions list.
prospective purchasers of military property are also furnished with a sale by reference pamphlet,which states that items on the munitions list which do not require demilitarization may be sold for military or other use,to those foreign countries to which the united states department of state will issue an export license under the itar the sale by reference pamphlet also states that the use,disposition,export,and reexport of military property is subject to all applicable united states laws and regulations,the aeca,and the itar.
bing and patte sun were the primary owners of all ports,a company headquartered in fontana,california.the primary business of all ports was the sale of united states government military property to the people republic of china.all ports maintained warehouse facilities in fontana,norfolk,virginia,and san antonio,texas.
the duties of operating all ports were split between bing and patte sun.bing sun inspected military property at various military facilities around the country.he prepared bid packages for submission to the drms.in addition,bing sun set up and oversaw the operation of all ports export facilities.patte sun,who was described as a knowledgeable businesswoman,administered the contracts that all ports had with the drms,each one of which,according to the written invitations for bid,contained munitions list items.all contract documents were delivered to all ports office in fontana,where she worked.patte sun prepared the checks in payment of the contracts awarded to all ports assisted in the management of all ports warehouse in fontana and made shipping arrangements with overseas freight forwarders for the export of the military property 
between and,all ports shipped over containers of military property to the people republic of china.during this period,approximately end use certificates were submitted to the drms on behalf of all ports as part of bid documents for lots of military property.patte sun completed and signed two of those end use certificates and the rest were completed and signed by bing sun.with one exception,these end use certificates indicated that the military property would be distributed in the usa and other countries and that the customers were unknown at the present time.however,beginning in,these lots of military property were shipped by all ports to but one customer which had become all ports sole purchaser in the people republic of china

the defendants contend that the aeca and its implementing regulations are constitutionally void for vagueness under the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.we review a defendant challenge to the constitutionality of a statute de novo.united states bostic,cir reviewing constitutionality of g.the constitutionality of a regulation is also reviewed de novo.united states lee,cir reviewing constitutionality of the aeca and its implementing regulations,cert.denied,d,and cert.denied,d.
due process requires that a criminal statute provide adequate notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that his contemplated conduct is illegal,for no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.buckley valeo,d quoting united states harriss.thus,the doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.kolender lawson,d.
the defendants challenge to the aeca and its implementing regulations is reviewed only as the aeca and the implementing regulations were applied to them.schleifer city of charlottesville,cir.v agueness challenges to statutes which do not involve first amendment freedoms must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand.united states mazurie,d.the supreme court has noted that the approach to vagueness governing a case like this is different from that followed in cases arising under the first amendment.there we are concerned with the vagueness of the statute on its face because such vagueness may in itself deter constitutionally protected and socially desirable conduct.united states dairy prods,d.moreover,where,as here,a criminal statute regulates economic activity,it generally is subject to a less strict vagueness test,because its subject matter is more often narrow and because businesses can be expected to consult relevant legislation in advance of action.united states iverson,cir quoting united states doremus,cir.a scienter requirement may mitigate a law vagueness,especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed.village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d.
we can not say that the aeca or its implementing regulations are unconstitutionally vague as applied to the defendants.in fact,as applied to the defendants in this case,the statute is rather specific as to what conduct is prohibited the export the attempted export,without a license,of items on the munitions list.as such,a person of ordinary intelligence,especially business people as knowledgeable as bing and patte sun,would understand what conduct is illegal.similarly,law enforcement is not vested with the unrestrained power to arrest anyone exporting or attempting to export,without a license,items listed on the munitions list.rather,under the circumstances of this case,the police may only make an arrest under the aeca and its implementing regulations if an individual exports or attempts to export munitions list items,without a license,with the requisite criminal intent.not surprisingly,other courts have upheld the constitutionality of the aeca and its implementing regulations against vagueness challenges.see,lee,at holding that the aeca and its implementing regulations were aimed at a narrow group of persons which included the defendants and that in the sensitive business of exporting military items,the statute and its implementing regulation more than suffice to put exporters on notice to consult the applicable regulations and,if necessary,contact the appropriate government agency to resolve any perceived ambiguity united states gregg,cir stating that the aeca is as simple a matter as forbidding a passenger to ride on a train without a valid ticket and rejecting the argument that the statute,which requires a knowing and willful export of munitions list items,was unconstitutionally vague in violation of due process united states swarovski,cir predecessor statute prohibiting export of munitions list items was not unconstitutionally vague,as regulation was aimed at exporters and put them on notice of licensing requirements.
at trial,the main thrust of the suns and all ports defense was that the material the defendants exported attempted to export fell within the scrap exemption contained in a commerce department regulation,g.this regulation provides in relevant part as follows 
g interpretation scrap arms,ammunition,and implements of war.arms,ammunition,and implements of war,as defined in the munitions list,and are under the jurisdiction of the department of state,except for the following,which are under the jurisdiction of the department of commerce 
other commodities that may have been on the munitions list are scrap,and therefore under the jurisdiction of the department of commerce,if they have been rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration to their original identity only by means of mangling,crushing,or cutting.when in doubt as to whether a commodity covered by the munitions list has been rendered useless,exporters should consult the office of defense trade controls,or the exporter counseling division,before reporting a shipment as metal scrap.
id.under the language of this department of commerce regulation,if an item which may have been on the munitions list has been rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration to its original identity by means of mangling,crushing,or cutting,the item is not subject to the export licensing requirements of the aeca and its implementing regulations.
even though g is found nowhere in the aeca or its implementing regulations,the district court allowed the defendants to pursue their defense theory and instructed the jury as follows 
now,ladies and gentlemen,there has been some reference to the department of commerce in this case and demilitarization in this case.title,part,section g of the federal code of regulations states,in part,that commodities that may have been on the united states munitions list are scrap and,therefore,under the jurisdiction of the department of commerce,if they have been rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration to their original identity only by means of mangling,crushing or cutting.
this section means that if any item that may have been on the munitions list has been rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration to its original identity by means of mangling,cutting,or crushing,it may be exported without a license or written authorization from the department of state.if,on the other hand,that item that may have been on the munitions list has not been rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration to its original identity by means of mangling,crushing,or cutting,it may not be exported without a license or a written authorization from the state department.
the defendants contend that items which they purchased that may have been on the munitions list were rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration to their original identity by means of mangling,crushing or cutting and,therefore,could be exported without a license or a written authorization from the state department 
if you find and accept as true the evidence in support of this contention and theory and believe the defendants defense theory,and this defense leaves you with a reasonable doubt as to whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the crimes charged then you must find the defendants not guilty.
the defendants raise two arguments concerning g,which regulation we will assume for the sake of argument applies in an aeca prosecution we shall address these arguments in turn.
first,the defendants contend that g is unconstitutionally vague as applied to them.this argument has no merit.
like the aeca and its implementing regulations,g is rather specific as to when it applies.the plain language of the regulation states that items must have been rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration to their original identity only by means of mangling,crushing,or cutting.g.as such,a person of ordinary intelligence would understand what conduct is necessary to fall within the regulation the item must be rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration by mangling,crushing,or cutting the item also,the regulation itself provides a means for exporters to verify their own compliance prior to shipping questionable items by consulting the state department office of defense trade controls or the commerce
