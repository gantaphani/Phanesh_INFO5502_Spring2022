this is a trade case concerning the interplay between the north american free trade agreement implementation act,stat.codified at nafta implementation act or nia,and the continued dumping and subsidy offset act,stat,cdsoa,repealed by the deficit reduction act of,b,stat.we heard argument on december.
the nia was enacted in.section of that act provides that any subsequent amendment to certain united states trade laws shall apply to goods from a nafta country only to the extent specified in the amendment.the cdsoa,enacted in,amended the trade laws by providing that antidumping and countervailing duties assessed on imported previously had been placed into the general fund of the united states instead be distributed on an annual basis to the affected domestic producers for qualifying expenditures.following enactment of the cdsoa,united states customs and border protection customs began distributing duties assessed on imported goods,including on goods imported from nafta countries canada and mexico,to domestic producers.
in,canadian lumber trade alliance,norsk hydro canada,canadian wheat board,ontario forest industries association,ontario lumber manufacturers association,the free trade lumber council together,the canadian producers,and appellant the government of canada sued the united states in the court of international trade,alleging that because the cdsoa does not specify that it applies to goods from nafta countries,it must be construed in light of section of the nia not to apply to goods from nafta countries.the plaintiffs sought,inter alia,a declaratory judgment interpreting the cdsoa in their favor,and an injunction against customs continued distribution of duties assessed on softwood lumber,magnesium,and hard red spring wheat from canada.
coalition for fair lumber imports executive committee,magnesium llc,united states steel,foundry manufacturing,neenah foundry,municipal castings,lebaron foundry,east jordan iron works,allegheny ludlum,and ak steel together,the domestic producers intervened in the litigation,arguing along with the united states that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge customs cdsoa distributions,had no cause of action,and were wrong on the merits in any event.after briefing and an evidentiary hearing,the court of international trade held that the canadian producers had standing and a cause of action,that the government of canada did not have standing because it had elected to proceed in the world trade organization wto,and that the merits favored the canadian producers.canadian lumber trade alliance united states,d.int l trade clta i.the court of international trade issued a declaratory judgment holding the cdsoa inapplicable to goods from canada and mexico,and granted an injunction against customs further distribution of duties assessed on softwood lumber,magnesium,and hard red spring wheat from canada.canadian lumber trade alliance united states,d.int l trade clta ii.
the united states and the domestic producers now appeal the judgment in favor of the canadian producers,and the government of canada the judgment against it and dismissal of its claims for lack of standing.we have jurisdiction over these appeals under a.we affirm the declaratory judgment issued by the court of international trade,because at least one has standing to seek it,and because the court of international trade properly interpreted the cdsoa,in light of section of the nia,to be inapplicable to goods imported from canada or mexico.we also affirm the court of international trade dismissal of the government of canada claims for lack of standing,though we hold that canada institution of wto proceedings did not determine this outcome.finally,we modify the injunction issued by the court of international trade so that it pertains only to hard red spring wheat,because subsequent events have rendered this case moot with respect to the softwood lumber and magnesium industries.
background 
relevant provisions of the nafta implementation act 
the united states entered into the north american free trade agreement nafta with canada and mexico in december of.congress passed the nia in november,president clinton signed the bill on december,and the nia was made effective on january,stat.section of the nia contains congress approval of the nafta treaty,providing that the congress approves the north american free trade agreement a emphasis added.section of the nia provides that n o person other than the united states shall have any cause of action or defense under a the agreement,nafta or by virtue of congressional approval thereof c emphasis added.
section of the nia,entitled t reatment of amendments to antidumping and countervailing duty law,lies at the center of this appeal.the entire section reads as follows 
any amendment enacted after the agreement,nafta enters into force with respect to the united states that is made to 
section or title vii of the tariff act of uscs et,or any successor statute,or 
any other statute which 
a provides for judicial review of final determinations under such section,title,or successor statute,or 
b indicates the standard of review to be applied,
shall apply to goods from a nafta country only to the extent specified in the amendment.
emphasis added.
as the court of international trade recognized,section of the nia is a magic words rule.a ny amendment to title vii of the tariff act of must contain certain magic words for congress to indicate that it intends to alter antidumping and countervailing duty laws with respect to nafta parties.clta i,d at.
b.the continued dumping and subsidy offset act 
in,congress enacted the cdsoa often referred to as the byrd amendment.before passage of the cdsoa,the duties collected pursuant to the antidumping statute were deposited with the treasury for general purposes.huaiyin foreign trade united states.the cdsoa changed this by providing that d uties assessed pursuant to a countervailing duty order,an antidumping duty order,or a finding under the antidumping act of shall be distributed on an annual basis under this section to the affected domestic producers for qualifying expenditures.a.in other words,the cdsoa direct ed customs to pay the collected antidumping duties to domestic producers harmed by the anticompetitive conduct rather than to keep the duties within the government.huaiyin foreign trade,at.
the cdsoa directed the commissioner of customs to establish a special account for each antidumping or countervailing duty order,and to deposit into each special account all duties collected after october,under the antidumping order or finding or the countervailing duty order with respect to which the account was established.e every year,the special accounts were to be distributed to affected domestic producers who had incurred and claimed qualifying expenditures.
as the court of international trade observed,the cdsoa does not specify that it applies to goods from canada or mexico nor did the united states provide advance notice of the cdsoa to canada or mexico or engage in consultations with regard thereto.clta i,d at.soon after enactment of the cdsoa,nine countries,including canada and mexico,instituted dispute resolution proceedings against the united states in the world trade organization,arguing that the cdsoa violated a range of international agreements.a wto dispute resolution panel,affirmed by the appellate body of the wto,ruled that the united states acted inconsistently with the uruguay round agreements in enacting the cdsoa,and as a remedy authorized the complaining nations to retaliate against the cdsoa by suspending tariff concessions on imports from the united states.see panel reports,united dumping and subsidy offset act of,appellate body reports,united dumping and subsidy offset act of,r.
congress repealed the cdsoa as part of the deficit reduction act of,which was signed into law on february.see,stat.the repeal was made effective as of october,but provided that customs may still distribute duties on entries of goods made and filed before october.id.b.
at various times between enactment of the cdsoa and its repeal,antidumping and countervailing duty orders were in place on softwood lumber,magnesium,and hard red spring wheat from canada pursuant to the cdsoa,customs distributed duties collected under these antidumping and countervailing duty orders,including duties collected on goods produced or sold by the canadian producers,to domestic producers for fiscal years,and.the approximate amounts of cdsoa distributions were as follows for softwood lumber from canada,about for,million for,and million for for magnesium from canada,about for,for,and for and for hard red spring wheat from canada,about for 
proceedings below 
on april,the canadian producers and the government of canada filed a total of five complaints against the united states and customs in the court of international trade alleging that customs distribution of duties assessed on imports from canada was an unlawful agency action within the meaning of the administrative procedure act,because the cdsoa,when properly interpreted in light of section of the nia,does not apply to goods from canada.each complaint asked the court to issue a declaratory judgment interpreting the cdsoa and to issue an injunction against further distribution of particular duties.most of the complaints also asked the court to instruct customs to collect back particular duties from the domestic producers to whom they had been distributed 
in june of,the parties in each case filed a motion to consolidate the cases in july of,the domestic producers filed motions to intervene,which were granted,and the united states and domestic producers moved to dismiss each of the complaints under court of international trade rule b lack of subject matter jurisdiction and court of international trade rule b failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
the court of international trade granted the motions for consolidation,and the canadian producers and government of canada moved for summary judgment.the court of international trade then construed these motions,as well as the united states and domestic producers motions to dismiss,as motions for summary judgment or judgment on the agency record.see.int l trade rules.on march and,the court held a hearing to resolve any disputed facts related to jurisdiction,clta i,d at.at the hearing,the court heard testimony from two fact witnesses,including neal fisher,administrator of the north dakota wheat commission the only affected domestic producer to receive cdsoa distributions of duties assessed on hard red spring wheat from canada.the court also heard from two expert witnesses,a professor of economics and a professor of business administration,who offered competing views of the likely effects of cdsoa distributions on market conditions.
on april,the court of international trade issued an opinion holding that the canadian producers had standing because they were likely to be economically injured by the challenged cdsoa distributions and were asserting interests within the zone of interest of section of the nia the government of canada did not have standing because it had elected to pursue a remedy for the challenged cdsoa distributions in the wto and had been awarded a remedy there the canadian producers had a cause of action under the apa and customs distribution of duties assessed on imports from canada was unlawful,because the cdsoa must be read in light of section of the nia not to apply to goods from canada or mexico.clta i,d at.
after further briefing concerning remedies,the court of international trade issued a second opinion on july,along with a judgment granting the canadian producers motion for judgment on the agency record denying the government of canada motion for judgment on the agency record denying the domestic producers and united states motions for judgment on the agency record as against the canadian producers,and granting those motions as against the government of canada dismissing the government of canada complaint declaring that pursuant to section of the nia,the cdsoa does not apply to antidumping and countervailing duties assessed on imports of goods from canada or mexico and enjoining customs from making any continued cdsoa distributions to the extent they derive from duties assessed pursuant to countervailing duty orders,antidumping duty orders,or findings under the antidumping act of,upon softwood lumber,magnesium,or hard red spring wheat from canada.clta ii,d at.int l trade consol,slip.judgment.the court of international trade declined to instruct customs to collect back any duties already distributed,however.the united states and domestic producers then filed timely appeals,and the government of canada filed a timely.
developments outside the proceedings below 
during and after pendency of the proceedings below,a number of important developments occurred in the softwood lumber,magnesium,and hard red spring wheat industries.developments after july,are not reflected in the record before the court of international trade,but we may consider them insofar as they bear on issues such as mootness.borlem industriais united states,a reviewing court is not precluded from considering events which have occurred between the date of an agency or trial court decision and the date of decision on appeal.

on october,pursuant to the sla,the united states revoked the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on softwood lumber from canada,effective retroactively to their may,issue date,without the possibility of reinstatement.the department of commerce also instructed customs to cease collecting cash deposits of antidumping and countervailing duties,as of october,on imports of softwood lumber products from canada,to liquidate all unliquidated entries subject to the revoked orders without regard to antidumping or countervailing duties,and to refund all deposits collected on such entries with accrued interest to the importers of record

hard red spring wheat 
on february,customs revoked the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on hard red spring wheat from canada,effective january,the north dakota wheat commission,the only affected domestic producer to receive cdsoa distributions derived from duties collected under these orders,was the only entity to claim qualifying expenditures pertaining to these orders for fiscal year according to counsel for the united states,the north dakota wheat commission could obtain up to in further distributions under the cdsoa,but for the court of international trade judgment in this case

t he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.

beyond this irreducible constitutional minimum of article iii standing,a plaintiff who brings claims under the administrative procedure act apa must also have prudential standing.as the supreme court has explained,prudential standing concerns the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.ass of data processing serv,camp,d.
here,the court of international trade held that the canadian producers possess standing,but that the government of canada does not because it elected to seek a remedy for its injury in the world trade organization.clta i,d at.on appeal,the domestic producers and the united states argue that the canadian producers have neither constitutional nor prudential standing,while the government of canada argues on that it possesses both types.we affirm that the government of canada lacks standing,though not because it instituted wto proceedings,and we affirm that the canadian wheat board has standing.we need not address the standing of any other plaintiff because,even assuming that the other canadian producers had standing in the court of international trade,their claims are now moot as we discuss below.
canadian wheat iii standing 
the parties frame their dispute as a question of whether empirical evidence was necessary to demonstrate in this case,or whether the court of international trade was correct to invoke the doctrine of competitor standing,which relies on economic logic to conclude that a plaintiff will likely suffer an when the government acts in a way that increases competition or aids the plaintiff competitors.see,clinton city of new york,d the supreme court routinely recognizes probable economic injury resulting from governmental actions that alter competitive conditions as sufficient to satisfy the article iii requirement,and any party who is likely to suffer economic injury as a result of governmental action that changes market conditions satisfies this part of the standing test.citing davis pierce,administrative law treatise ed.see also ass of data processing serv,at.holding that data processing companies had standing to challenge a ruling by the comptroller of the currency allowing banks to provide data processing services accord arnold tours,camp,d investment.institute camp,d i t is urged at the outset that petitioners lack standing to question whether national banks may legally enter a field in competition with them.this contention is foreclosed by data processing.
here,the canadian producers alleged that they or their constituent members compete directly with united states producers to whom or to whose surrogates customs distributed money under the cdsoa.by using antidumping and countervailing duties imposed on canadian goods to subsidize these competitors rather than for some other purpose,the canadian producers argued,customs made it very likely that the canadian producers would suffer economic injury in the form of increased competition.to support this argument,the canadian producers presented expert testimony to the court of international trade concerning the types of economic injury that were likely to result from government subsidization of a competitor.the united states and domestic producers presented countervailing expert testimony,but the court of international trade was persuaded by the canadian producers arguments that there will likely be some injury as a result of the distributions.clta i,d at.
on appeal,the united states and domestic producers argue that the court of international trade erred by failing to require an empirical analysis linking specific cdsoa distributions to specific,demonstrated economic harms,lost sales,decreased market share.only with such an analysis,this argument proceeds,could the canadian producers have proven an that is concrete and particularized,and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.
we do not agree.one purpose of the requirement,as the court of international trade explained,is to ensure that the plaintiffs have a stake in the fight and will therefore diligently prosecute the case while,at the same time,ensuring that the claim is not abstract or conjectural so that resolution by the judiciary is both manageable and proper.clta i,d at citing united food commer.workers union local brown group,d other citations omitted.therefore,as the third circuit has noted,i is not mount everest.danvers motor ford motor,cir.rather,a plaintiff may establish its in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof.lujan,at.
here,the court of international trade conducted a evidentiary hearing devoted to the question of.the canadian producers needed only to establish that it was more likely than not they would be injured by the challenged cdsoa distributions,and they could fairly employ economic logic toward that end even though empirical analysis might conceivably have provided a higher level of certainty see adams watson,cir b asic economic theory quite consistently transcends utter randomness by positing elemental laws of cause and effect predicated on actual market experience and probable market behavior.indeed,most competitor standing cases depend on such core economic postulates.emphasis in original 
although the doctrine of competitor standing is not yet in our circuit,we note that the circuit repeatedly has applied the doctrine to hold that parties suffer constitutional injury in fact when agencies lift regulatory restrictions on their competitors or otherwise allow increased competition.energy power auth.ferc.see also new world radio,fcc,explaining that circuit applies competitor standing doctrine to an agency action that itself imposes a competitive injury,that provides benefits to an existing competitor or expands the number of entrants in the petitioner market.emphasis added telecom ass fcc,regulatory decisions that permit subsidization of some participants in a market can have the requisite injurious impact on those participants competitors.
in this case,the canadian wheat board is not a textbook candidate for competitor standing,but the doctrine is instructive nonetheless.the canadian wheat board sells hard red spring wheat.the north dakota wheat commission,the only recipient of the cdsoa distributions challenged by the canadian wheat board,the antidumping and countervailing duties assessed on hard red spring wheat from canada,is an organization which promotes the sale of hard red spring wheat on behalf of farmers in north dakota and sponsors research on hard red spring wheat,but does not itself sell wheat.clta i,d at emphasis added.adams,at competitor standing is premised on a plaintiff status as a direct competitor whose position in the relevant marketplace would be affected adversely by the challenged governmental action emphasis in original.further,the research sponsored by the north dakota wheat commission is,and thus may inure to the benefit of the canadian wheat board as well as north dakota wheat producers.
however,the court of international trade found that the north dakota wheat commission promotional activities have helped to take back market share from canadian wheat in specific export markets,clta i,d at,and the united states and domestic producers have not established that this factual finding was clearly erroneous.loss of market share is certainly an economic injury and it is quite rational to infer that customs,by distributing money to an entity that aims to take away market share from canadian wheat and has already been somewhat successful in that effort,is likely to inflict further economic injury on the canadian wheat board.indeed,fewer inferences are required to find in this case than in most competitor standing cases,where it is presumed,without affirmative findings of fact that a boon to some market participants is a detriment to their competitors.
the united states and domestic producers argue that the north dakota wheat commission has yet to spend any of the money it has received under the cdsoa,and that therefore any injury to be suffered by the canadian wheat board as a result of cdsoa distributions is not an imminent injury as required by article iii.we disagree.the administrator of the north dakota wheat commission testified that the reason this money has yet to be spent is the continued uncertainty involved in this litigation,and that d ue to that uncertainty,the wheat commissioners told us to place the money in the cash reserve and leave it alone until we had more certainty.the united states and domestic producers can not rely on the pendency of this lawsuit to argue that a threatened harm is not imminent.see,eckles city of corydon,cir the city has stated that it will only abstain from enforcing the notice while the suit is pending and if the suit is dismissed eckles could expect the city to enforce the notice therefore t he threat of injury to eckles is imminent and concrete.
because the court of international trade was correct to conclude,given its findings of fact,that customs distribution of money to the north dakota wheat commission under the cdsoa was likely to cause an economic injury to the canadian wheat board,and because this injury would be prevented by a declaratory judgment and injunction against such distribution,the court of international trade was correct to hold that the canadian wheat board has constitutional standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief.
canadian wheat standing 
the court of international trade was also correct to hold that the canadian wheat board has prudential standing under the apa.a plaintiff has prudential standing if the interest sought to be protected by the plaintiff is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.ass of data processing serv,at.the supreme court has explained that this zone of interest test is not meant to be especially demanding,and,i n cases where the plaintiff is not itself the subject of the contested regulatory action,the test is satisfied unless the plaintiff interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.clarke sec.indus.ass n,d.
here,although the canadian wheat board alleges a violation of the cdsoa,the canadian wheat board seeks the protection of section of the nia.we have explained that b y passing the nafta implementation act,congress created for importers of goods from one of the three signatory countries the right to preferential tariff treatment.xerox united states.section embodies one form of preferential tariff conditions,on specific legislative pronouncement,the united states ability to amend certain trade laws as applied to goods from a nafta country.see clta i,d at t he apparent purpose of section is to protect canadian and mexican importers from some statutory alterations of the competitive environment contemplated by the antidumping and countervailing duty laws in effect as of january.the canadian wheat board markets goods from canada,a nafta country,and therefore has an interest in preferential tariff treatment.its interests are clearly not so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in section that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.clarke,at.
the united states and domestic producers assert that neither the nia nor its legislative history evidences any congressional intent to give foreign producers a right to sue for violations of section.but there need be no indication of congressional purpose to benefit the plaintiff,clarke,at,because the review provisions of the apa are generous.ass of data processing serv,at.therefore,we affirm that there are no prudential standing restraints to bar the canadian wheat board claims here.clta i,d at.
government of iii standing 
we also affirm that unlike the canadian wheat board,the government of canada does not have standing,though we do not rely on the court of international trade analysis to reach this result.first,we note that the government of canada disclaims derivative,standing based on injury to the canadian argues instead that it is independently injured by the challenged cdsoa distributions.the court of international trade concluded that,even assuming such injury,the government of canada does not have standing here because it elected to challenge the cdsoa in the wto and was successful in that forum.clta i,d at by pursuing its action before the wto,canada has elected this remedy at the expense of others.
on appeal,both the government of canada and the united states argue that the court of international trade reliance on election was erroneous.we agree.election may arise in the jurisdictional context if a plaintiff is entitled to prosecute a claim in one of two fora.having chosen one forum,the plaintiff may not proceed on the same claim in the other forum.see,bonneville assocs.united states,courts have consistently interpreted the contract disputes act as providing the contractor with an choice of forum.thus,once a contractor makes a binding election to appeal the contracting officer final decision to a board of contract appeals or to the court of federal claims,the contractor can no longer pursue its claim in the other forum.internal citation omitted.
here,however,the government of canada does not seek to litigate the same claim in two fora.in the wto,canada joined with nine other countries to claim that congress passage of the cdsoa violated a range of international agreements signed by the united states.see dispute resolution body,panel reports,united dumping and subsidy offset act of,appellate body,appellate body reports,united dumping and subsidy offset act of,r.in this case,by contrast,the government of canada claims that customs distribution of certain duties to domestic producers violates domestic law,the cdsoa itself,when properly interpreted in light of section of the nia.the court of international trade was not deprived of jurisdiction over canada statutory claim merely because canada had chosen to enforce international agreements in the wto.wright universal.serv,d in rejecting the argument that the doctrine of election of remedies barred the title vii lawsuit,we reasoned that a grievance is designed to vindicate a contractual right under a collective bargaining agreement,while a lawsuit under title vii asserts independent statutory rights accorded by congress.explaining court holding in alexander,d.
nevertheless,the burden still falls on the government of canada to show that it has of any injury to the canadian challenge customs interpretation of the cdsoa.the government of canada advances three theories of standing,none of which are sufficient under article iii.
first,the government of canada argues that it is injured by the denial of its statutorily granted rights under section of the nia,and that congress has granted canada a procedural right to standing under the court of international trade jurisdictional statute,i which provides that the court of international trade has exclusive jurisdiction over actions against the united states that arise out of any law of the united states providing for administration and enforcement with respect to tariffs and duties on imports.canada relies on massachusetts epa,in which the supreme court held that the state of massachusetts had standing to challenge the environmental protection agency denial of massachusetts rulemaking petition seeking federal regulation of automobile greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act,d.the court held that massachusetts had standing in part because congress had enacted a procedural right to challenge the rejection of its rulemaking petition as arbitrary and capricious,in b which provides that a petition for review of action of certain epa decisions may be filed only in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia.epa.at.here,the government of canada asserts,congress has enacted an analogous procedural right in i,under which canada has standing to enforce section of the nia.
however,the supreme court in epa stressed that the result in that case depended heavily on the special position and interest of massachusetts,and explained that states are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction.epa.at.
when a state enters the union,it surrenders certain sovereign prerogatives.massachusetts can not invade rhode island to force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,it can not negotiate an emissions treaty with china or india,and in some circumstances the exercise of its police powers to reduce emissions might well be.
the government of canada is not fairly analogous to a state of the union in this analysis.although canada surely made concessions to the united states in negotiating the nafta treaty canada has not truly surrendered any sovereign prerogatives,such as the ability to negotiate a resolution of this dispute with the united states or the ability to defend itself.therefore the government of canada is not entitled to special solicitude in the standing analysis,as was given to massachusetts.epa.at.
canada second theory of standing fails for similar reasons.analogizing itself to native american tribes,the government of canada argues that it has standing because it is a sovereign seeking to protect its sovereign interests.but to the extent that native american tribes are entitled to any special solicitude regarding standing,here the government of canada has not established that it is similarly situated.see,united states creek nation.tribe was in a state of tutelage and entitled to rely on the united states,its guardian,for needed protection of its interests begay albers,cir the united states government,out of solicitude for the welfare of its indian wards,undertook by treaties,statutes and executive orders to establish legal relations to protect the indian wards.
finally,the government of canada argues that even if its sovereignty does not confer special status for purposes of standing,canada has still been deprived of the benefit of section of the nia,and is as entitled as an individual or corporation to challenge regulatory action that interferes with enjoyment of benefits.the problem with this theory is that,having disclaimed reliance on any economic injury to the canadian producers,the government of canada does not explain what benefit it has been deprived,what injury it has suffered.columbia broad,united states.complaint alleged that appellant ability to conduct its business and maintain its public broadcasting service is seriously impaired and the challenged regulations will make the operation of appellant business more costly,reduce its earnings and render its property and business less valuable idaho power ferc,explaining that because contract duration is a measure of value,appellant suffered a cognizable injury when it was compelled to forgo a contract and instead enter a contract with its associated market risks.
because the government of canada has not demonstrated an independent of injury to the canadian producers,and is not entitled to special solicitude that would temper the requirement,the government of canada does not have independent standing under article iii to challenge customs interpretation of the cdsoa 
though standing and the case or controversy requirement are most frequently analyzed with respect to the initiation of litigation,t he standing article iii requires must be met by persons seeking appellate review,just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance.arizonans for official english arizona,d.if a plaintiff claims cease to present a case or controversy due to developments during litigation,those claims become moot.one commentator has defined mootness as the doctrine of standing set in a time frame the requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation standing must continue throughout its existence mootness.parole comm geraghty,d quoting monaghan,constitutional adjudication the who and when,yale,see also lewis cont l bank,d plaintiff must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit internal citation omitted.
here,the domestic producers argue that the claims of canadian producers in the softwood lumber and magnesium industries are moot.the canadian lumber trade association and norsk hydro canada,do not contest this argument we agree that,even assuming the canadian producers in the softwood lumber and magnesium industries had standing in the court of international trade under the doctrine of competitor standing,their claims have been mooted by subsequent developments.
in their complaints below,the softwood lumber and magnesium canadian producers asked the court of international trade for both prospective relief a declaratory judgment and an injunction,and retrospective relief instructions to customs to collect back duties already distributed.however,the court of international trade granted only prospective relief,see clta ii,d at,and the canadian producers have not the court denial of retrospective relief.therefore,each canadian producer only continue s to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit if there are any duties,assessed on goods from canada,that have yet to be distributed to a competitor of that canadian producer under the cdsoa,and that would be distributed but for the judgment below.
the canadian producers in the softwood lumber industry can not meet this standard because there are no longer any duties on softwood lumber from canada remaining to be distributed under the cdsoa.pursuant to the sla,customs has retroactively revoked the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on softwood lumber from canada,liquidated all relevant entries without collecting antidumping or countervailing duties,and refunded all such duties in customs possession to the importers of record.with no threat of further challenged distributions,there is no threat of further injury to the canadian producers in the softwood lumber industry.therefore we hold that the claims of the canadian lumber trade alliance,ontario forest industries association,ontario lumber manufacturers association,and the free trade lumber council for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot.
the sole canadian producer from the magnesium industry,norsk hydro canada,can not show a continued personal stake in this suit for a different reason.having chosen to exit the magnesium industry,norsk hydro canada will no longer compete with affected domestic producers of magnesium.even if there are duties assessed on magnesium from canada that remain to be distributed by customs under the cdsoa,norsk hydro canada can no longer argue that it will likely suffer competitive injury as a result of those distributions.therefore,we hold that the claims of norsk hydro canada,for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot.
no party has argued that the claims of the canadian wheat board are moot,and counsel for the united states represented at oral argument that but for the court of international trade judgment below,customs could further distribute as much as to the north dakota wheat commission under the cdsoa.therefore,we hold that the claims of the canadian wheat board for declaratory and injunctive relief are not moot,and we turn to the substance of this dispute.see arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d only one plaintiff need have standing for a court to consider the case accord citizens united for free speech ii long beach twp.bd.of comm rs,to obtain injunctive or declaratory relief,it is sufficient that there be at least one plaintiff with standing.
cause of action 
we next consider whether the canadian wheat board has a cause of action.the domestic producers argue that even assuming standing,the claims of the canadian wheat board are barred by section c of the nia,which provides that n o person other than the united states shall have any cause of action or defense under a the agreement or by virtue of congressional approval thereof c.as noted above,the canadian wheat board instituted this suit under section of the administrative procedure act apa.
the apa confers a general cause of action upon persons adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,but withdraws that cause of action to the extent the relevant statute precludes judicial review,a.whether and to what extent a particular statute precludes judicial review is determined not only from its express language,but also from the structure of the statutory scheme,its objectives,its legislative history,and the nature of the administrative action involved.

beginning with express statutory language,we observe that section c of the nia bars claims brought under the agreement or by virtue of congressional approval thereof.c.the domestic producers contend that the phrase by virtue of congressional approval thereof refers to the entire nia,including section,and therefore bars the canadian wheat board suit.but the express language of the nia refutes this position,and makes clear that congressional approval refers only to section of the nia and not to the entire act.section of the nia defines agreement to mean the north american free trade agreement approved by the congress under section a.emphasis added.section,in turn,provides that the congress approves the north american free trade agreement a emphasis added.therefore section c bar against causes of action based on the agreement or by virtue of congressional approval thereof,reads most naturally as barring only those suits brought under nafta itself or under section of the nia.because this suit does not rely on nafta itself or section of the nia,but rather on section of the nia,the suit is not barred by section c.
the structure of the nia does not weigh against this conclusion.the domestic producers argue that because the nia was enacted through the fast track congress combines into a single implementing bill its approval of a trade agreement and any legislation necessary to implement the united states obligations under the the phrase congressional approval must be construed to refer to the entirety of the bill.but even the law governing the fast track mechanism carefully distinguishes between congressional approval and other,substantive provisions of an implementing bill,explaining that an implementing bill for a trade agreement must contain both a provision approving such trade agreement,and if changes in existing laws or new statutory authority is required to implement such trade agreement,provisions,necessary and appropriate to implement such trade agreement,either repealing or amending existing laws or providing new statutory authority.b emphasis added.
in the case of the nia,section is clearly the provision approving nafta,while section is a provision changing existing law to implement a requirement of nafta namely,nafta a,which provides in part that while each nafta party reserves the right to change or modify its antidumping law or countervailing duty law,such changes shall apply to goods from another nafta party only if the amending statute specifies that it applies to goods from that party or from the parties to this agreement.compare of the nia certain subsequent amendments shall apply to goods from a nafta country only to the extent specified in the amendment.
the domestic producers also argue that their interpretation of section c is supported by the legislative history of a parallel provision in an earlier bill implementing the canadian free trade agreement cfta,a precursor to nafta.in particular,they point to a senate report stating that section c of the cfta implementation act deal s with the question of whether this agreement,cfta or this bill creates a private right of action to challenge government action on the ground that it is inconsistent with the obligations of the united states under the agreement.cafta implementation act,at,cong,emphasis added.here,however,the canadian producers do not base their claims on the obligations of the united states under an agreement in this case,nafta,but on the obligations of the united states under domestic law namely,section of the nia.more importantly,the legislative history of the statute actually at issue the court of international trade construction.see statement of administrative action saa,doc.i,at,explaining that section c of the nia precludes private right s of action based on the nafta,or on congressional approval of the agreement in section a emphasis added.i,at,reprinted in,section c contains a general prohibition on private right s of action arising from the nafta,the supplemental agreements,or approval of the nafta by congress under section a of the bill emphasis added.
the domestic producers further argue that their interpretation of section c is supported by past judicial consideration of a parallel provision in the uruguay round agreements act uraa in bronco wine united states department of treasury,a district court considered section c of the uraa,which provides that no person except the united states shall have any cause of action or defense under any of the uruguay round agreements or by virtue of congressional approval of such an agreement.c.the district court held that this section clearly and unambiguously states that there may be no action by a private party,brought under any law,to enforce the provisions of the uraa.bronco wine.at.the ninth circuit affirmed in an unpublished opinion,writing that the plaintiff claims were barred because no one other than the united states shall have a cause of action under the uruguay round agreement.bronco wine batf,wl.lexis,at cir,cert.denied,d brackets in original,emphasis added,internal quotation omitted unpublished.
it appears that the ninth circuit in bronco wine may have conflated the uraa with the uruguay round agreements,affirming the district court dismissal of claims brought under the uraa on the but section c bars claims brought under the agreements themselves.compare nsk united states,d.int l trade holding that where plaintiff challenged commerce interpretation of a united states statute,section c of the uraa was an erroneous technical bar that did not prohibit the suit.but in any event,we do not find the bronco wine decision regarding the uraa to be persuasive in the context of the nia,particularly given the clear language of the nia itself,as discussed above.therefore we hold that section c of the nia does not bar the canadian wheat board cause of action here.
of the cdsoa 
having held that the canadian wheat board has standing and a cause of action,we turn finally to the merits of its claim that the cdsoa must be read,in lig
