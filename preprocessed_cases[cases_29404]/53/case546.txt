this case presents the question whether the department of commerce commerce regulation providing for the use of entered value of imported merchandise in the assessment rate formula b is consistent with the antidumping statute codified in pertinent part at and,if so,whether it is reasonable.we conclude that commerce interpretation is not foreclosed by the statute,nor have the appellants shown that the interpretation is unreasonable.we accordingly defer to that interpretation under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,and we affirm the decision of the court of international trade in koyo seiko,united states,d.int l trade.
background 
this case concerns the determination of antidumping duties for imports of tapered roller bearings with an outside diameter of four inches or less and parts thereof from japan trbs by koyo seiko,and its sole united states subsidiary,koyo corporation of collectively,koyo 
under the antidumping statute,commerce is required to impose antidumping duties on imported merchandise that is being,or is likely to be,sold in the united states at less than fair value to the detriment of a domestic industry.commerce determines those duties by first calculating the dumping margin for the subject merchandise,the total amount by which the price charged for the subject merchandise in the home market the normal value exceeds the price charged in the united states the united states price.a the statute obligates commerce to use the dumping margin as the basis for the assessment of countervailing or antidumping duties on entries of merchandise covered by the antidumping determination and for deposits of estimated duties.a c.
commerce uses the dumping margin to assess antidumping duties on merchandise imported during the review period,and also to calculate cash deposits of estimated duties for future entries of the subject merchandise.torrington united states.a calculational problem arises,however,in the determination of antidumping duties.although the dumping margin is calculated on sales during the review period,the duty is imposed upon entries,imports during the review period.since sales and imports are typically not the same during any particular review period,a method for determining the dumping duty on imports is required.commerce has adopted two different calculational for cash deposits and one for final duties.commerce requires importers to make cash deposits in an amount based,in pertinent part,on the estimated weighted average dumping margin for the merchandise.d b.commerce calculates this estimated weighted average dumping margin,estimated duty,by dividing the aggregate dumping margins determined for a specific exporter or producer here,koyo by the aggregate export prices or constructed export prices of such exporter or producer.b.in other words,the cash deposit rate is calculated as a percentage of united states sales price.torrington,at.this rate is then applied to estimated imports estimated entries.
commerce has devised a different methodology for use in calculating the final amount of the duties to be imposed on merchandise already imported into the united states.when an antidumping duty is imposed upon imported merchandise,commerce calculates an assessment rate for each importer by dividing the dumping margin for the subject merchandise here,the trbs by the entered value of such merchandise for normal customs purposes.koyo seiko,d at this methodology has been codified in a regulation that states,in pertinent part,that 
t he secretary of commerce normally will calculate an assessment rate for each importer of the subject merchandise covered by the review.the secretary of commerce normally will calculate the assessment rate by dividing the dumping margin found on the subject merchandise examined by the entered value of such merchandise for normal customs duty purposes.
b the assessment rate is then applied uniformly on all entries each importer made during the period of review.tapered roller bearings and parts thereof,finished and unfinished,from japan,and tapered roller bearings,four inches or less in outside diameter,and components thereof,from japan final results of antidumping duty administrative reviews,final results.in other words,the assessment rate is calculated as a percentage of entered value of the subject merchandise sold in the united states during the review period.torrington,at.that rate is then applied to the merchandise imported actual entries during that review period.
in simple terms,the formula for cash deposit rates uses sales during the review period as the denominator the formula for the final duty uses imports as the denominator.both formulae use sales figures in the numerator.both apply the formula to imports entries 
commerce has recognized that the methodology for calculating the final duty assessment rate allows commerce to collect only a reasonable approximation of the duties that would be imposed if it had calculated the specific duties due on particular sales of merchandise imported during the review period.in tapered roller bearings and parts thereof,finished and unfinished,from the people republic of china preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review and new shipper review.july,tapered roller bearings,for example,commerce stated in pertinent part that 
while commerce is aware that the entered value of sales during the review period is not necessarily equal to the entered value of entries during the review period,use of entered value of sales as the basis of the assessment rate permits commerce to collect a reasonable approximation of the antidumping duties which would have been determined if commerce had review ed those sale of merchandise actually entered during the review period.
commerce methodology for calculating the assessment rate was applied in the present case.in november,commerce initiated an antidumping administrative review of the antidumping duties on trbs covering the period from october,through september.see initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews and request for revocation in part,
on july,commerce issued the preliminary results of its administrative review,assigning to koyo a dumping margin for trbs for the review period.tapered roller bearings and parts thereof,finished and unfinished,from japan,and tapered roller bearings,four inches or less in outside diameter,and components thereof,from japan preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative reviews,july,preliminary results.
on november,commerce issued the final results of its administrative review,once again assigning to koyo a dumping margin for trbs for the review period.final results.at.in those final results,commerce stated in pertinent part that 
in accordance with cfr b,we will calculate ad valorem assessment rates for the merchandise based on the ratio of the total amount of antidumping duties calculated for the examined sales made during the period of review to the total customs value of the sales used to calculate those duties,the entered value.this rate will be assessed uniformly on all entries each importer made during the period of review.
id.at emphasis in original.in other words,commerce used the entered value of the subject merchandise sold during the period of review as the denominator when calculating an assessment rate.the issue on appeal is whether it was proper for commerce to do so,or whether it was required to use the sales value of merchandise imported during the review period in the denominator,as is done for the cash deposit calculation.
koyo appealed the assessment rate imposed by commerce to the court of international trade,first arguing that commerce methodology contravened the plain terms of the antidumping statute.the court disagreed,concluding that neither the statute nor its legislative history provides an unambiguously expressed intent with regard to the precise question at issue,namely,the designation of a particular denominator for the assessment rate formula.koyo seiko,d at citing chevron,at.
koyo next argued that commerce use of the entered value was unreasonable.koyo noted that the numerator of the assessment dumpin
