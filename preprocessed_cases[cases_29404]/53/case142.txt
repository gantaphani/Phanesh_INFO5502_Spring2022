appellant evans was convicted of wire fraud under,based on a may,telefax from the victim to evans.the sole issue presented is whether the jury was entitled to find that evans caused this telefax to be sent for the purpose of executing the scheme within the contemplation of section we conclude that the jury was so entitled.
background 
evans was president of jagar limited,which imported produce to the bahamas for resale.mark mayrsohn was president of produce direct,pdi,which was jagar primary supplier of produce.in,pdi acquired credit insurance from the bank to address the risk of by jagar.in,in conjunction with its application to renew its policy,pdi requested a financial report from jagar.jagar produced to pdi a financial statement showing the company as profitable through the fiscal year ending june,even though an independent auditor report prepared in february reflected that jagar suffered a net loss of almost during that fiscal year and described its survival as in substantial doubt.the renewal policy was issued effective september,with a term expiring may.under the terms of the policy,pdi was required to report to the insurer arrearages of over days and to make reasonable collection efforts before filing a claim.
jagar regularly purchased or more of produce a week and,until early,it paid pdi invoices within days or a bit more.at that point,jagar payments became smaller,such that its outstanding balance swelled to over by late april.on april,jagar abruptly switched suppliers,but on may and may it made payments to pdi totaling approximately.
on may,mayrsohn telefaxed evans a letter announcing his imminent visit to the bahamas and requesting a meeting to discuss the companies present and future business relations.mayrsohn then called jagar bookkeeper,diane fletcher,and scheduled a meeting with evans for may.on may,mayrsohn telefaxed to fletcher the letter on which conviction was based the body of which reads as follows 
just a short note to confirm our meeting together with evans on monday at at your offices.
for your review i enclosed some preliminary information,a report of the current receivables with the aging from the invoice date.as discussed,we must stay within days for the bank.
your account is right now at that limit and we should be receiving your payments now in order to keep up with the schedule.
we hope that you are preparing something to send us for this week and can continue to stay within the day requirement.
we look forward to a positive and successful meeting together.
on may,fletcher telefaxed a letter to mayrsohn confirming the monday meeting and listing invoices that needed to be reconciled between the parties.at the may meeting in the bahamas,evans made clear that jagar would not give pdi any new business or write a check on the spot,but he assured mayrsohn that jagar would promptly send another check and would pay off its debt.on may,jagar sent pdi a check for,which paid in full the three oldest invoices.on june,jagar sent pdi a check for,which paid in full the next oldest invoice.these were the last payments jagar made,leaving an unpaid principal balance of almost.
the jury convicted evans on three counts of wire fraud,involving the may telefax as well as subsequent transmissions from mayrsohn to evans dated june and july.the district court granted evans motion for judgment of acquittal with respect to the latter two letters but denied the motion with respect to the may telefax.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal.united states hernandez,cir.when the motion raises a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in the government favor.id.internal quotes omitted.to affirm the denial,we need determine only that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the evidence established the defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states perez,cir.
iii.discussion 
a transmission is for the purpose of executing the scheme if it is incident to an essential part of the scheme.pereira united states.letters mailed after a scheme has reached fruition can not have been for the purpose of executing the scheme within the meaning of.united states georgalis,cir this description of fruition as the critical juncture derives from kann united states,in which the court held that,because the scheme had reached fruition before the transmissions at issue,i t can not be said that the mailings in question were for the purpose of executing the scheme,as the statute requires.id.at.at.supreme court and eleventh circuit cases have since repeatedly identified fruition of the scheme as the point beyond which mail and wire transmissions can not be in furtherance of the scheme,schmuck united states,d united states maze,d united states adkinson,cir we have not hesitated to reverse mail fraud convictions where the underlying scheme has reached fruition prior to the mailing.
a scheme has reached fruition when it is fully consummated.henderson united states,cir accord united states kent,cir see also kann,at.at the scheme in each case had reached fruition because t he persons intended to receive the money had received it irrevocably and i t was immaterial to them,or to any consummation of the scheme,how the bank which paid or credited the check would collect from the drawee bank.
evans describes the true objective of the scheme as getting pdi to continue supplying produce on credit.that objective,evans continues,was fully accomplished by april,when jagar stopped acquiring produce from pdi.thus,he concludes,the scheme had reached fruition by that date,such that mayrsohn telefax of may could not have been for the purpose of executing the scheme 
to the extent evans assumes that a scheme to defraud necessarily reaches fruition when the defendant receives the fruit of his fraud,he is mistaken.i t is a principle of mail fraud law that use of the mails after the money is obtained may nevertheless be for the purpose of executing the fraud.united states ashdown,cir.if the scheme continues,mailings made after receipt of the money can clearly support conviction.united states knight,cir.this is another way of saying that the scheme may embrace more than just fraudulent acquisition of money or documents.united states kent,cir.for example,a two pronged scheme may include both writing checks on closed accounts to obtain goods and services without paying for them and working to retain those goods as long as possible by convincing merchants and banks that the checks were actually legitimate.united states lee,cir.
more specifically,p recedent is clear that letters designed to conceal a fraud,by lulling a victim into inaction,constitute a continuation of the original scheme to defraud.georgalis,at.that is,when the scheme includes not only obtaining the benefit of the fraud but also delaying detection of the fraud by lulling the victim after the benefit has been obtained,the scheme is not fully consummated,and does not reach fruition,until the lulling portion of the scheme concludes.the government concedes that evans had received the full benefit of his fraud as of april.the issue is whether mayrsohn may telefax falls within this lulling doctrine.
the doctrine traces its roots to united states sampson,d 
t he indictment in this case alleged that the defendants scheme contemplated from the start the commission of fraudulent activities which were to be and actually were carried out both before and after the money was obtained from the victims and specifically alleged that certain documents were mailed by the defendants to the victims for the purpose of lulling them by assurances that the promised services would be performed.we can not hold that such a deliberate and planned use of the united states mails by defendants engaged in a nationwide,fraudulent scheme in pursuance of a previously formulated plan could not be found to be for the purpose of executing a scheme within the meaning of the mail fraud statute.
id.at.at.the mailings at issue in sampson,which were sent by the defendants to multiple victims after the defendants had obt
