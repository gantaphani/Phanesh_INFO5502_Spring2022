the united states and the coalition for fair preserved mushroom trade coalition appeal the decision of the court of international trade reversing the scope ruling by the international trade administration,department of commerce commerce that held that mushrooms imported by plaintiffs collectively tak fat were not excluded from within the scope of the notice of amendment of final determination of sales at less than fair value and antidumping duty order certain preserved mushrooms from the people republic of china.because the court of international trade erred when it disturbed the determination by commerce that tak fat mushrooms are not excluded from the dumping order,the decision of the court of international trade is reversed and the scope determination by commerce is reinstated.
the antidumping order at issue in this case began as a petition by mushroom producers who requested an investigation of imported preserved mushrooms from chile,china,india,and indonesia but proposed to exclude particular mushrooms that were marinated,acidified,or pickled.in proposing such an exclusion,petitioners cited to the harmonized tariff schedule hts or htsus subheading.in a supplementary letter to commerce they again stated that marinated,acidified and pickled mushrooms are those prepared or preserved by means of vinegar or acetic acid,as under hts subheading.the petition also included a footnote that stated that the scope of the petition comported with the food and drug administration fda standards of identity for canned mushrooms.
after investigation,commerce issued an order that applied to preserved mushrooms from china which are prepared or preserved by cleaning,blanching,and sometimes slicing or cutting and then packed and heated in containers including but not limited to water,brine,butter or butter sauce.at.commerce did not include references to either the hts headings or the fda standards when it excluded marinated,acidified or pickled mushrooms,which are prepared or preserved by means of vinegar or acetic acid,but may contain oil or other additives from the order.id.
on january,tak fat requested a scope ruling to determine whether their mushrooms were excluded from the antidumping order.tak fat argued that the fda standards should be used to determine which mushrooms fall within the order,and that their mushrooms contained vinegar,an ingredient not found in canned mushrooms under the fda standards.when tested by commerce,tak fat canned mushrooms were less than percent acetic acid by weight and the canning solution had a ph that ranged from to.a ph of less than is considered an acidified food under the fda definition.stating that the ph was lowered in order to prevent the growth of botulism and preserve the mushrooms,tak fat contended that the presence of vinegar in its mushrooms removes them from the scope of canned mushrooms under fda standards.commerce rejected tak fat contention and found in its preliminary ruling that the fda standard of identity is not controlling of the scope of the order.instead of the fda standard,commerce relied on the language in the order that was appropriated from hts subheading to determine the scope of the exclusion.commerce looked to customs rulings that classified products under this hts heading by percentage weight of vinegar or acetic acid.these rulings referenced headquarters ruling letter hrl from may,which defined products prepared or preserved in vinegar or acetic acid as having a minimum of percent acetic acid content.commerce applied the percent acetic acid test to tak fat products and found that because they did not meet the test for prepared or preserved by vinegar or acetic acid,tak fat mushrooms were not excluded from the antidumping order.
tak fat then appealed the case to the court of international trade.tak fat trading united states,d.int l trade.they argued before the court that the plain language of neither the order nor the record supported commerce reliance on the hts reference and the consequent use of the percent acetic acid standard in determining whether tak fat mushrooms were excluded.id.at.the court agreed with commerce that the hts,not the fda,standard was the correct reference for determining if tak fat products were excluded from the scope of the order.id.at.the court,however,rejected commerce reliance on the test found in the customs headquarters ruling because the court differentiated pickled from marinated or acidified and found that the percent acetic acid standard applies only to pickled products and not necessarily to marinated or acidified products.id.at.the court thus found the standard set forth in the customs headquarters ruling should not apply to tak fat product because it was never contended that tak fat mushrooms were pickled.id.consequently,the court found that there was not substantial evidence in support of the scope determination by commerce,and that tak fat mushrooms therefore should not be subject to the antidumping duty.id.thus,the court granted tak fat motion for summary judgment and vacated the determination by commerce that tak fat packaged mushrooms were within the scope of the antidumping order.id.the court agreed with commerce basic contention that the hts as construed through customs rulings,not the fda,provides the correct test and it differed with commerce only on whether tak fat products are not excluded under the definition determined in reference to particular rulings of customs.see id.at.
