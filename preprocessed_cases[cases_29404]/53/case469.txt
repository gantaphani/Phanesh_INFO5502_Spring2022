intervenor rapistan systems advertising is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in grand rapids,michigan.rapistan is a subsidiary of siemens.rapistan is the owner by assignment of the patent.
ii.procedural history 
on june,siemens and rapistan together,filed a complaint with the itc pursuant to section of the tariff act of,asserting that vanderlande industries nederland bv and vanderlande industries,together,vanderlande had engaged in unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in violation of the statute.in particular,alleged that in connection with the importation,sale for importation,and sale within the united states after importation of certain sortation systems,parts thereof,and products containing same that are manufactured by vanderlande,alj op.at,vanderlande had infringed claims of the patent.
on july,the itc issued a notice of investigation that was subsequently published in the federal register on july.july.on may,an itc administrative law judge alj issued an initial determination that terminated the investigation with respect to twelve of the asserted claims,leaving fifteen claims for adjudication.this initial determination subsequently became a final itc determination.on june,the alj held an evidentiary hearing on the remaining issues in the investigation.on october,the alj issued an initial determination holding,inter alia,that vanderlande had infringed claims and of the patent,vanderlande had not infringed the remaining asserted claims of the patent,and was not equitably estopped from asserting the patent against vanderlande.
on december,the itc issued a notice of its decision to review,at the commission level,the alj rulings on two issues the construction of a term found in independent claim and dependent claims and,and equitable estoppel.with the exception of these two issues,the alj determinations were adopted by the commission and thus became final itc determinations.on january,the itc issued a notice of violation of section and a limited exclusion order.the notice of violation indicated that the commission had decided to modify the alj analyses of the two issues on review,but that the commission had reached the same ultimate conclusions on these issues,noninfringement and no equitable estoppel.the limited exclusion order applied to s ortation systems,and shoes and slats thereof,covered by claims or of patent that are manufactured abroad imported by or on behalf of vanderlande with the exception of sortation system parts for use as spare parts at the united parcel service hub facility in louisville,kentucky.on february,the itc issued the commission opinion,which provided a more detailed explanation of the january,notice of violation and limited exclusion order.
vanderlande timely appealed to our court,which has jurisdiction pursuant to a.we heard argument on march.
iii.nature of the technology 
this case addresses sortation systems,mechanical equipment used to sort items.the typical sortation system has a main conveyor belt and a number of spurs that branch off the main belt the parties liken a conveyor belt and its spurs to a highway and its.in systems,certain devices mechanically push items off the main conveyor belt onto the appropriate spur.at issue in this case are positive sorters.in a system,the main conveyor belt is made up of a series of slats,and a shoe or diverter shoe rides on top of each slat.the shoes mechanically push items across the slats and onto the appropriate spur.
one difficulty with shoe sorters is that when a shoe pushes an item along the slat,the item generates forces that react against the shoe.these reaction forces tend to flip the shoe over and to rotate the shoe sideways.the,the patent,discloses technology designed to minimize the effects of these reaction forces and promote ease of glide of shoes across slats.
the title of the patent is modular diverter shoe and slat construction.the specification of the patent states 
background of the invention 
this invention relates to a conveyor sortation system and in particular to a positive displacement sortation system in which diverting shoes travelling with the conveyor surface laterally diverts sic packages onto selected spur lines 
in systems,t he diverting motion applies reaction forces to the shoes tending to rotate the shoes about their vertical axis as well as about the long axis of the slats.these forces,of course,increase with heavier packages and those having a high coefficient of friction with the slats.these difficulties are aggravated by a desire to provide line speeds,which require greater ease of gliding between the shoe and the slats.efforts to provide structural support to resist the reactive forces tend to be at odds with ease of glide.
summary of the invention 
the present invention provides a sortation system which is capable of very high line speeds without excessive line noise by utilizing unique slats and diverter shoes,which are capable of rapid and smooth gliding along the slats while resisting reactionary forces 
the invention is embodied in a sortation system in which each of the slats is defined by a wall having a planar upper portion that defines the conveyor surface in combination with diverter shoes having a support portion including a substantially continuous glide surface that surrounds the slat and has substantially the same configuration as the outer surface of the slat.in a preferred embodiment,the slat has a parallelogram and bearing means are defined between at least one edge of each slat and an engaging portion of the glide surface of the diverter shoe.the bearing means is provided by an enlarged radius surface at the slat edge.such bearing means are preferable sic provided at diagonally opposite slat edges in order to better resist reaction forces about the axis of the slat.
a lateral stabilizing means is additionally provided between each slat and an engaging portion of the glide surface of the corresponding diverter shoe in order to resist vertical axis reaction forces.the lateral stabilizing means is preferably a outward extension of one portion of the slat engaging a mating portion of the shoe glide surface.

discussion 
vanderlande challenges the itc determination of infringement of claims and of the patent and the itc rejection of vanderlande defense of equitable estoppel.in analyzing these issues,we review the itc factual findings under the standard,and we review the itc legal determinations de novo.see,honeywell int l,int l trade comm n.
infringement 
on infringement,vanderlande contests the itc infringement analysis of two limitations that are recited in claim and incorporated by reference in claim glide surface surrounding said slat wall and glide surface having substantially the same configuration as said outer surface of said slat.
glide surface surrounding said slat wall 
vanderlande challenges the itc construction of the claim limitation glide surface surrounding said slat wall.vanderlande contends that this claim limitation refers to an inner surface of a diverter shoe that contacts the outer surface of the slat on all sides.so construed,vanderlande does not infringe claims and,as it is undisputed that the inner surface of the mark posisorter diverter shoe only contacts the outer surface of the slat on three sides,and does not contact the top of the slat.the itc rejected vanderlande argument as to contact,determining that the limitation at issue actually did not require any contact at all 
t he term glide surface in claim and incorporated by reference in claim is merely a surface and does not imply any points of contact or between the inner surface of the diverter shoe and the outer surface of the slat wall.points of contact or between the glide surface and the slat wall are not claimed features of this element of claim all that matters to being a glide surface,really,is whether the inner surface of the mark posisorter shoe i moves over or along the surface of the slat in a smooth,effortless manner without pivoting or rolling and ii is.there is no factual dispute that the mark posisorter shoe inner surface possesses these characteristics.ergo,the inner surface of the mark posisorter constitutes a glide surface as that term is used in claim.
we review the itc claim construction de novo.honeywell,at.we seek to determine what a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the claims to mean in light of the intrinsic evidence of record,including the written description,the drawings,and the prosecution history,if in evidence.teleflex,ficosa am.while extrinsic evidence can shed useful light on the relevant thus better allow a court to place itself in the shoes of a person of ordinary skill in the intrinsic evidence is the most significant source of the legally operative meaning of disputed claim language.vitronics conceptronic.indeed,a court should look first to the intrinsic evidence of record,to determine if the patentee expressly define d terms used in the claims or define d terms by implication,dow chem.sumitomo chem.
the critical term in the limitation glide surface surrounding said slat wall is glide surface,as the parties agree that the itc correctly construed surrounding to mean to extend on all sides to encircle to enclose on all sides to cut off communication or retreat.alj op.at.the written description most detailed discussion of the term glide surface is in the context of the explanation of the preferred embodiment 
each diverting shoe includes a support member and a diverting member mounted to the support member.support member includes a glide portion having a continuous glide surface having substantially the same configuration as the outer surface of slat for gliding movement along the slat continuous surface includes a channel surrounding projection of the slat such that the projection rides within the channel,and.continuous surface additionally includes a support rib which engages top wall of the slat to support an upper wall of the support member.continuous surface additionally includes an enlarged radius forward upper corner and an enlarged radius lower rear corner,in which enlarged radius corners and of the slat,respectively,ride.this arrangement provides bearing engagement between the enlarged radius corners of the slat and the corresponding corners of surface to resist reaction forces tending to rotate the shoes about the axis of elongation of the slat 
patent,ll.as this passage and the accompanying drawings make plain,contiguous glide surface is the inner surface of the diverter shoe.
in the preferred embodiment,the glide surface contacts the outer surface of the slat at various points these points of contact resist the reaction forces that are generated when the diverter shoe pushes an item across the slat.at the corner and the corner of the slat,the slat engages the glide surface enlarged radius forward upper corner and enlarged radius lower rear corner.id.at,ll.in the drawings of the preferred embodiment,both the and corners of the slat also appear to make contact with the glide surface.on the top of the slat,the slat engages the glide surface support rib.id.at.on the bottom of the slat,a projection off the slat rides within the glide surface channel.id.at.the parts of the glide surface are depicted without the slat in figure 
but in the preferred embodiment,the glide surface also has regions that do not contact the slat.indeed,regions of noncontact are found on every side of the slat,as can be discerned on close inspection of figure 
vanderlande acknowledges that the glide surface in the preferred embodiment has regions that do not contact the slat,but emphasizes that the glide surface includes at least some contact with every side of the slat.vanderlande argument is accurate with respect to the preferred embodiment,which includes not only midsection contact points on the top and bottom of the slat,but also contact points at the corners of the slat.
but the summary of the invention quoted at length supra expressly contemplates other embodiments,stating that the invention includes embodiments with contact between at least one edge,corner of each slat and an engaging portion of the glide surface of the diverter shoe.id.at,ll.emphasis added.moreover,while the summary of the invention describes a midsection contact point on the bottom of the slat,it does not describe a midsection contact point on the top of the slat.in short,the summary of the invention teaches that the invention embraces glide surfaces that do not contact the slat on all sides,a glide surface with contact points only on the bottom of the slat and one corner of the slat.while such glide surfaces may not be,the summary of the invention emphasizes that it is preferable to have bearing means at diagonally opposite slat edges in order to better resist reaction forces about the axis of the slat,id.at,ll.do fall within the disclosure of the invention,indicating that the patent requires a broader meaning of glide surface than the one pressed by vanderlande.
vanderlande argues that statements of to the european patent office epo during the prosecution of a european counterpart to the patent support vanderlande contention that a glide surface must contact the slat on all sides.in the prosecution to which vanderlande refers,the epo initially rejected the patent application in view of a reference,a shoe sorter that used skids to stabilize the shoe on the slat.in this shoe sorter,the skids were located below the top wall of the slat.argued to the epo examiner that if the skids themselves were considered to be the glide surface,the glide surface would not surround the slat as required by the application 
in claim of the present european application,the slat is defined by a wall which has an upper portion defining the conveying surface,and the wall is surrounded by a glide surface of the diverter shoe.this does not appear to be the case in the prior art reference.in annex of the official communication,the examiner indicated that the planar upper portion,the top wall of the slat is surrounded by the skids,but this does not appear to be the case,because the planar upper portion is above the skids.
alj op.at citations omitted.as the alj properly determined,the distinctions in counterargument to the epo have nothing to do with whether or where the glide surface contacts the slat.id.at.
the extrinsic evidence likewise fails to show that those skilled in the relevant art would understand a glide surface as having contact on all sides.at the evidentiary hearing before the alj,the expert witness for and the inventors named on the patent testified that the term glide surface had no independent meaning in the art of sortation systems.vanderlande did not present any evidence to the itc that the term glide surface had any meaning in this instead,vanderlande argued to the itc,and contends on appeal,that the term has an ordinary meaning that requires contact.the linchpin of vanderlande argument is a definition of the noun form of glide found in a dictionary a device for facilitating the movement of something esp a circular usu.metal button attached to the bottom of furniture legs to provide a smooth surface.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.vanderlande places particular weight on the illustrative example of the button on the bottom of a furniture leg,emphasizing that the button completely contacts both the furniture leg and the floor.
vanderlande reliance on this illustrative example from a definition is unpersuasive,for several reasons.first,vanderlande misapprehends the proper role of as opposed to technical,dictionaries in claim construction.claims are to be construed from the vantage point of a person skilled in the relevant art.to the extent that this artisan would understand a claim term to have the same meaning in the art as that term has in common,lay usage,a dictionary can be a helpful aid to claim construction.but where as expert testimony credited by the factfinder,or technical that artisans would attach a special meaning to a claim term,or,as here,would attach no meaning at all to that claim term independent of the specification,dictionaries are rendered irrelevant with respect to that term a dictionary can not overcome credible evidence of the meaning or lack of meaning of a claim term.dow,at we have previously cautioned against the use of dictionaries,lest dictionary definitions be converted into technical terms of art having legal,not linguistic significance.quoting multiform desiccants,medzam.as the itc properly determined in this case 
vanderlande effort to attribute to the term glide surface the ordinary dictionary definition of the word glide alone is misplaced.vanderlande did not present any evidence outside of the dictionary definition of the word glide to show that glide surface has an ordinary meaning in the material handling industry or in the sortation industry.by contrast,demonstrated,through its expert witnesses having personal experience in the material handling and diverter sortation field,that glide surface does not have an ordinary meaning,and the itc staff agreed with this view.
alj op.at citations omitted.
second,even if dictionaries could be useful in circumstances like these,the definition of the noun glide cited by vanderlande a device for facilitating the movement of something concerns only one word in a claim term and is vague,abstract,and fails to connote a particular structure.indeed,vanderlande does not even rely on the definition itself,but rather on an extrapolation from the illustrative example of the button.vanderlande argument rests on a long series of tenuous assumptions the word glide in the claim term glide surface is based on the noun form,not the verb form the characteristics of the illustrative example of the button necessarily obtain with respect to all glides therefore every glide surface must have the characteristics of the button therefore a glide surface surrounding a a contact this structure on all sides just as the button contacts the floor.vanderlande shaky syllogism can not overcome the uncontroverted testimony regarding the lack of ordinary meaning of glide surface in the art of sortation systems.
third,in any event vanderlande dictionary argument is entirely eclipsed by the patent written description,which provides detailed,examples of glide surfaces,not only in the preferred embodiment but also in the express contemplation of other embodiments,including embodiments in which the glide surface does not contact every side of the slat.see dow,at stating that any definition found in or ascertained by a reading of the intrinsic evidence may not be contradicted by any meaning found in dictionaries.as noted above,the intrinsic evidence is the most significant source of the legally operative meaning of disputed claim language,vitronics,at,and this is particularly true where,as here,the written description provides definite and readily discernible guidance as to the intended meaning of a structural claim term.indeed,it is doubtful whether any extrinsic evidence could contradict or overpower the meaning evident from the written description here,and certainly vanderlande button can not do so.
vanderlande argues that its construction of glide surface is buttressed by the content of a mediation statement prepared by in connection with the mediation of a prior litigation.the content of this mediation statement,which would be inadmissible in a patent suit in federal district court,see federal rule of evidence evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations is not admissible,was at most a theory advanced in a proceeding to mediate a separate litigation,upon which we place in claim construction,beckson marine,nfm,l itigation the extent not expressed in claim language,the patent specification,or the prosecution not affect claim scope.in any event,we have considered the mediation statement which the parties marked as confidential and believe it is ambiguous with regard to the issue at hand.
we conclude that a glide surface is a diverter shoe inner surface that has some contact,but not necessarily complete contact,with the outer surface of the slat,and that need not contact all sides of the slat.we note that our construction of glide surface is different from the itc construction,which did not require any contact at all.we believe the itc definition was overly broad.indeed,the itc definition could conceivably embrace technologies far beyond the patent disclosure,such as a glide surface that rides above the slat on air currents,or a glide surface that is magnetized to repel the outer surface of the slat.
returning to the claim limitation as a whole,we conclude that glide surface surrounding said slat wall refers to a glide surface as just defined that completely encircles the slat.this construction embraces vanderlande mark posisorter,whose diverter shoe inner surface has some contact,but not complete contact,with the outer surface of the slat,and which completely encircles the slat.
glide surface having substantially the same configuration as said outer surface of said slat
