executive order the executive order or order,prohibits united states citizens from investing in and trading with iran the question we face is whether an american citizen guarantees of payments that furthered a trade agreement with an iranian company are covered by the executive order and,if so,whether the guarantees are unenforceable as a result.we conclude that the guarantees were illegal under the executive order and,under the circumstances of this case,unenforceable.
background 
the first amended complaint 
this appeal arises from the district court denial of the defendant motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.we therefore assume true the following facts,alleged in the first amended complaint see libas carillo,cir.
in or around november,an iranian company,seyd sayyad ssl,and a hong kong company,kingdom enterprises kel,entered into a business arrangement for the purpose of harvesting artemia cysts brine shrimp eggs from a lake in iran the iranian government required sizeable payments for licenses and other fees to authorize the shrimp egg harvesting project,and ssl undertook related financial commitments.karim arshian,an iranian citizen affiliated with ssl,was required to execute several guarantee checks related to the proposed operations.
simon goe,a citizen affiliated with kel,guaranteed repayment of arshian costs by executing two personal guarantees,one on november,and another on january.each time,goe promised to reimburse arshian for any expenditures made in securing the harvest license,customs clearance,office and living arrangement,up to without the promised guarantees,arshian would have been unwilling to execute the referenced guarantee checks.
arshian subsequently paid more than toward these expenses and requested repayment from goe.goe refused to honor the guarantees.he paid arshian nothing.because goe did not reimburse arshian as promised,arshian could not make the required payments.arshian was unable to pursue legal action on his own because he was imprisoned,and sold his rights under the guarantees to massoud bassidji,who is identified in the complaint as an individual residing in toronto,canada.the record does not show the terms of the assignment,including whether arshian will receive any of the proceeds if the guarantees are enforced.
proceedings in district court 
bassidji filed a breach of contract claim in district court in california.goe asked the court to dismiss the complaint,on the ground that the guarantees were illegal under executive order now superseded by executive order and therefore unenforceable 
executive order,like its predecessor,executive order,bans certain economic transactions by united states person s with iran.the order was promulgated under the authority of the international emergency economic powers act ieepa.its purpose is to deal with iran unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,foreign policy,and economy of the united states,see order,by isolat ing iran from trade with the united states.kalantari nitv,cir quoting united states ehsan,cir quoting executive order internal quotation marks omitted dep t of state dispatch may,quoting secretary of state warren christopher as stating that executive order will ban all trade and investment with iran.
the district court denied goe motion to dismiss.the court reasoned that the executive order and its implementing regulations ban only specified conduct,for example,the importing of goods or services of iranian origin or owned or controlled by the government of iran into the united states,and whatever transactions were implemented to further such conduct emphasis added.because the underlying conduct,the exchange of goods between hong kong and iran,is legal,the district court reasoned,agreements by a united states citizen in furtherance of such a transaction are not prohibited.the district court did not rule,at that time,on bassidji alternative argument supporting enforcement of the guarantees that bassidji was not in pari delicto equally at fault with goe,so the contracts should be enforced despite their illegality to avoid providing goe a windfall from his illegal actions.
the district court subsequently certified its order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b,finding,as b requires,that the order involves a controlling question of law.in so concluding,the district court addressed and rejected bassidji in pari delicto theory,recognizing that if the agreement were enforceable even if illegal,the illegality question would not control the result.the general rule that illegal contracts are not enforceable,the court stated,is qualified if,after looking at the kind of illegality and the particular facts involved,enforcement would in fact best achieve the aims of the policy or law the contract violates.taking the alleged facts as true,the district court concluded that goe was at greater moral fault,and that conduct similar to goe making guarantee promises and then not honoring them would be encouraged by invalidating the guarantees or assignment.the court found,however,that counterbalancing factors of national security,economics,and foreign policy outweighed the moral fault and deterrence considerations.
we granted bassidji request for an interlocutory appeal.after oral argument,the parties attempted for some time to mediate their dispute with the aid of the court mediators.after mediation failed,the case was submitted for decision.
discussion 
choice of law 
to determine whether the executive order barred goe from issuing the guarantees,we must decide whether the order applies to them.bassidji maintains that it does not,as hong kong law applies.we disagree.
federal jurisdiction in this case is based on the parties diversity of citizenship.we therefore apply the principles of the forum state,here california.see stud trans int l airlines,cir.to determine the law governing a contract,california courts look to the relevant statute and,for further guidance,to the principles outlined in the restatement.five bunch,cir.
california codified rules provide that a contract is to be interpreted according to the law and usage of the place where it is to be performed or,if it does not indicate a place of performance,according to the law and usage of the place where it is made.cal.if bassidji assertions are correct and the second guarantee was executed in hong kong,the california rule suggests that hong kong law applies,at least as to that guarantee,as no place of performance is indicated.
there is an exception to the california rule,however,when courts are called upon to enforce a contract that implicates strong public policy concerns.california narrow,public policy exception to the resolution of conflicts through a neutral comparison of government interests applies only when foreign law is so offensive to california public policy as to be prejudicial to recognized standards of morality and to the general interest of the citizens mcghee arabian am.oil,cir quoting wong tenneco,cal d,quoting knodel knodel,cal d,quoting biewend biewend,cal d,alteration and second omission in original.illegal trade with iran,a country whose government poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,foreign policy,and economy of the united states,see order,represents just this sort of policy concern.california law,which incorporates executive order through the supremacy clause,therefore applies to both the california guarantee and the similar hong kong guarantee see kashani tsann kuen china enter,th,d,recognizing that california law includes federal law for purposes of analysis,so that a violation of federal law is a violation of law for purposes of determining whether or not a contract is unenforceable as contrary to the public policy of california.
ii.the executive order 
executive order prohibits,among other things 
any transaction or dealing by a united states person,wherever located,including purchasing,selling,transporting,swapping,brokering,approving,financing,facilitating,or guaranteeing,in or related to i goods or services of iranian origin or owned or controlled by the government of iran.
order,d d i.
the interpretation of section d is an issue of first impression in the federal courts.as is true of interpretation of statutes,the interpretation of an executive order begins with its text.see united states hassanzadeh,cir.the text must be construed consistently with the order object and policy.northwest forest res.council glickman,cir quoting alarcon keller,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the text of section d plainly prohibits goe conduct.the artemia cysts were goods of iranian origin,and the guarantee covered costs incurred in harvesting them.the transaction between arshian and goe was certainly related to the brine shrimp eggs the only reason for the transaction was to facilitate their harvesting goe guaranteeing of financial repayment is explicitly included as a type of transaction or dealing prohibited by section d.
in response to this textual analysis,bassidji argues that the executive order is simply too broad to permit a literal interpretation.bassidji contends,for example,that if an american in hong kong purchased soup containing iranian shrimp,that conduct would fall within section d.bassidji is incorrect.the iranian transactions regulations,pt,promulgated under the authority of the executive order carve out exceptions for personal expenses related to travel within a foreign country,including payment of living expenses and acquisition of goods or services for personal use.d.similarly,the suggestion at oral argument that a broad reading of the order would forbid transportation companies to carry a carpet of iranian origin from one place to another within the united states is inconsistent with the implementing regulations.see id.a except for transactions involving the government of iran,all domestic transactions with respect to goods located in the united states are authorized exception not here pertinent omitted.
apparently unaware of the limitations incorporated in the implementing regulations,the district court followed a limiting principle of its own.the court concluded that the executive order bans only transactions facilitating conduct,such as the importing of goods or services,otherwise banned by the order.
the district court interpretation is not only unnecessary for addressing concerns about de minimis application of the order,given the regulations,but also in tension with the overarching purpose of the executive order.limitation of imports and exports under sections and a is but a means toward the larger end of exerting economic pressure on iran.
overall,these sanctions aim to induce iran government to reduce the threat that,according to the executive order,iran poses to united states interests.hassanzadeh,at violating the order import restrictions on iranian goods is harmful because of the c ontribution of financial support to terrorism.
with this purpose in mind,sections b f can not be construed as merely implementing sections and a.section c,for example,which limits investment in iran,does not exist merely to effectuate the prohibition on trade.rather,the prohibition against investment goes to the heart of the economic sanctions regime.investment in iran directly aids the iranian economy whether or not it ultimately leads to an exchange of goods between iran and the united states.see generally letter to congressional leaders on prohibiting certain transactions with respect to iran,pub.papers,stating that the embargo prohibits any activities with iran and mak ing clear that this means all direct or indirect involvement in such activities wherever those activities occur emphasis added.
similarly,although the transaction that goe guaranteed was not directly related either to the import or to the export of goods between iran and the united states,it furthered a result inconsistent with the purposes of the executive order.the transaction promoted the transfer of wealth to iran,including,it appears,the payment of fees to the iranian government.that the licenses pertained to a business deal,the export of brine shrimp eggs from iran to hong kong,that is not illegal under the executive order,is irrelevant.while the executive order does not,and could not,ban all trade between hong kong and iran,see a granting the president the authority under ieepa to regulate trade only of persons subject to the jurisdiction of the united states,united states citizens are expressly prohibited from facilitating such trade by guaranteeing the payment of costs incurred by parties to the sale.see order d.
we therefore reject the district court limiting interpretation of the executive order.the guarantees,we conclude,violated both the text and the animating purpose of the executive order.on the facts before us,they were illegal.
iii.enforcement of illegal guarantees 
goe contends that,as illegal contracts,the guarantees are unenforceable.we can reach this issue even though the district court certified for interlocutory appeal only the question of whether the guarantees violated the executive order.when reviewing a district court order certified under b,our jurisdiction is not limited to deciding the precise question the district court certified to us we may address any issue fairly included within the order we are reviewing.lee am.ins,cir.
here,the relevant district court order is the denial of goe motion to dismiss.the motion contended that the guarantees were illegal and therefore unenforceable the district court denied the motion because it concluded that the guarantees did not violate the executive order.any issue material to the effect of the illegality defense on the propriety of dismissing the action is fairly included within the certified order.the question of enforceability is critical to determining the validity of the district court denial of the motion to dismiss,as the district court recognized when it decided that question in its order certifying the interlocutory appeal.
a threshold question is whether california or federal law should apply to the enforceability question.this suit is a breach of contract action,with our jurisdiction premised solely on diversity of citizenship under.the question whether a particular agreement is enforceable is one of substance,not procedure.under erie tompkins,the law of the forum state,california,would normally apply.
in this case,however,goe raises a federal law claim as a defense.while we recognize that federal law governs whether the transaction between goe and arshian was illegal,the enforceability of the illegal guarantees under general principles of contract law is a separate question.courts have reached divergent conclusions concerning which law should be applied to determine enforceability in these circumstances.
kelly kosuga,d,stated,flatly,that the effect of illegality under a federal statute is a matter of federal law,even in diversity actions in the federal courts after erie.id.at.citation omitted see also sola jefferson.when a federal statute condemns an act as unlawful,the extent and nature of the legal consequences of the condemnation,though left by the statute to judicial determination,are nevertheless federal questions,the answers to which are to be derived from the statute and the federal policy which it has adopted.the seventh circuit has held,relying on kelly,that w hen the statute is federal,federal law determines not only whether the statute was violated but also,if so,and assuming the statute itself is silent on the matter,the effect of the violation on the enforceability of the contract.pub.serv.carbon county coal,cir.
this principle,however,has either been honored in the breach,or has come to encompass a corollary permitting the incorporation of the law of the forum state in some circumstances.in torrez torrez in re torrez,cir,for example,without discussing the possibility of applying federal law,we applied california law to the question whether to enforce a contract that violated federal statutory dictates concerning subsidized irrigation water 
similarly,a recent california court of appeal decision applied california law in determining the scope of the illegality defense as it relates to the same executive order here at issue,also without alluding to kelly or sola.see kashani,d at.
in this case,the result does not turn on whether we apply federal or state law,so we need not decide whether kelly and sola govern.both federal law and california law begin from the core proposition that whatever flexibility may otherwise exist with regard to the enforcement of illegal contracts,courts will not order a party to a contract to perform an act that is in direct violation of a positive law directive,even if that party has agreed,for consideration,to perform that act.
the supreme court in kaiser steel mullins,d,stated this bedrock principle emphatically,stressing the difference between cases in which the courts are asked to order an illegal act and cases in which the relief sought does not seek directly to order illegal activity.id.at.the court recognized that there is considerable room for the balancing of equitable considerations in pursuit of the overriding general policy of preventing people from getting other people property for nothing when they purport to be buying it.id.at.quoting kelly,at.quoting cont l wall paper louis voight sons.holmes,dissenting.kaiser steel made clear,however,that the realm of nuanced judicial determinations concerning enforcement when an illegality defense is asserted only begins p ast the point where the judgment of the court would itself be enforcing the precise conduct made unlawful by the act.id.quoting kelly,at.internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original emphasis added.where the relief sought does not pass that is,where a promise can only be enforced by commanding unlawful conduct,id.at.the principle that illegal promises will not be enforced in cases controlled by the federal law,id.at,takes center stage and does not admit of exceptions.see also id.at.emphasizing that federal courts authority to enforce agreements against public policy is subject to the limitation that the illegality defense should be entertained in those circumstances where its rejection would be to enforce conduct that the laws forbid.
applying that core principle,kaiser steel first assumed the invalidity under the antitrust laws and e of the national labor relations act,e,of a collective bargaining agreement between kaiser steel and a union representing its employees.the agreement required kaiser steel to pay a penalty into the union trust funds for any coal purchased from employers who were not making contributions to the funds on their employees behalf.the court then held that the purchased coal clause was unenforceable even after the collective bargaining agreement had expired and all work under it had been done,even though the agreement contained a clause providing for renegotiation at the behest of the union in the event the purchased coal clause was deemed illegal.id.at.the reason for abjuring reliance on equitable considerations and permitting what was arguably a windfall to kaiser steel,the court made clear,was that 
if kaiser undertaking is illegal under the antitrust or the labor laws,it is because of the financial burden which the agreement attached to purchases of coal from producers,even though they may have contributed to other employee welfare funds.it is plain enough that to order kaiser to pay would command conduct that assertedly renders the promise an illegal undertaking under the federal statutes.
id.at.emphasis added.
that kaiser steel establishes a limiting principle,not a general pronouncement about the enforceability through damages awards or otherwise of agreements in some respects illegal,has sometimes been overlooked.see,nagel adm investor,cir stating that despite kaiser steel ringing declaration,many cases continue to treat the defense of illegality to the enforcement of a contract as presumptive rather than absolute,forgiving minor violations and not allowing the defense to be used to confer windfalls citing cases paul arpin van lines,universal transp,cir this general rule of not enforcing illegal contracts is almost as much honored in the breach as in the observance.nuanced approaches to the illegal contract defense,taking into account such considerations as the avoidance of windfalls or forfeitures,deterrence of illegal conduct,and relative moral culpability,remain viable in federal court and represent no departure from kaiser steel,but only as long as the relief ordered does not mandate illegal conduct.see.pub.serv,at applying an equitable,balancing approach,while recognizing that where the contract itself is it would be if it were a violation of section of the sherman act,or a contract to commit a bank robbery it would be governed by kaiser steel souvenir ctr.historic figures,explaining that kaiser steel prevents courts from enforcing contracts where doing so would make them effectively become a party to the allegedly illegal scheme transfair int l,united states,fed.cl,relying on the restatement second of contracts,chapter united food commercial workers int l union,local foster poultry farms,cir noting that courts will not enforce an arbitration award when it violates a public policy that is explicit,dominant,and one that specifically militates against the relief ordered by the arbitrator internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
california law is similar.under california law,the general rule is that the courts will deny relief to either party who has entered into an illegal contract or bargain which is against public policy,cal d.thus,while i n situations in which no strong objections of public policy are present,a party to the illegal agreement may be permitted to enforce it,witkin,summary of california law,at ed.supp,and the california courts will therefore give contractual remedies where an agreement is asserted to be illegal in a wide variety of circumstances,see,arthur gensler,assocs.larry barrett,cal d,california courts will not fashion an equitable remedy where doing so involves enforcing the precise conduct made unlawful in contravention of the legislative purpose,joe freitas sons food packers,processors warehousemen local,d,citing kaiser steel,at.see also wong,at as this court emphasized in lee on long,cal d,a case in which a group of gamblers unsuccessfully sought to recover the spoils of their illicit activities no principle of law is better settled than that a party to an illegal contract can not come into a court of law and ask to have his illegal objects carried out further internal quotation marks omitted.
illustrative is kashani,a recent california court of appeal case concerning an illegality defense under the same executive order here at issue.kashani recognized a wide variety of circumstances in which california courts will indeed give force to contracts that are in some respect illegal,listing,among other exceptions to the statutory and judicial language that illegal contracts are void and unenforceable,such considerations as unjust enrichment,imposition of a harsh penalty,interpretation of statutory penalties to exclude the illegality defense,lack of serious moral turpitude,termination of the agreement,and whether the underlying policy would be better served by enforcement.see kashani,d at.at the same time,kashani recognized the core principle that courts may not themselves order violations of the law,citing to and quoting from wong tenneco.id.at.kashani concluded that none of the available equitable considerations was sufficient to justify enforcement,given the strength of the public interest underlying the executive order and the patently illegal contracts at issue.id.at.
we therefore proceed to examine whether,given the facts alleged in the complaint,a plausible remedy exists for bassidji that would not require a court to order a legal violation.
iv.the legality of a damages remedy 
federal and california law,as explicated above,would bar an american court from ordering goe to pay arshian pursuant to the illegal guarantees.such a payment would violate the precise terms of the executive order,which prohibit any transaction or dealing by a united states person related to goods or services of iranian origin and any new investment by a united states person in iran.order d d i,c.a payment from goe to arshian would provide funds to the iranian economy,payin
