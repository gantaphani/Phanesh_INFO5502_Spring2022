in this antidumping case,saha thai steel pipe public company saha and appellants allied tube and conduit and wheatland tube company collectively domestic producers appeal from a final judgment of the united states court of international trade trade court which sustained a decision by the department of commerce commerce.commerce granted saha a duty drawback adjustment,increasing its export price to reflect the implied cost of exempted import duties and included the exempted import duties in saha cost of production and constructed value.we affirm.
background 
this case concerns the final results issued by commerce in its administrative review of an antidumping duty order covering carbon steel pipes from thailand.see circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from thailand final results of antidumping duty administrative review.dep t of commerce,period of review,hereinafter final results.saha,the sole respondent in the administrative review,is a thai producer of carbon steel pipes that exports its product to the united states.the domestic producers are interested manufacturers.
understanding the nature of the issues in this case requires a brief overview of certain aspects of antidumping law,as defined by the tariff act of.
dumping occurs when a foreign firm sells a product in the united states at an export price ep that is lower than the product normal value nv the amount by which nv exceeds ep is the dumping margin.see.for exporters based in market economy countries such as thailand,nv is generally calculated to be the price at which the foreign like product is first sold for consumption in the exporting country a b i.however,in determining that sale price,commerce may disregard sales made at less than the manufacturer cost of production cop.id.b.if no sales in the exporting country remain after disregarding sales below cop,then commerce will alternatively base nv on the constructed value cv of the merchandise.id.b.cop and cv are closely related.the major components of cop are the cost of manufacture selling,general,and administrative expenses and packaging expenses.id.b.cv generally includes the same or similar elements as cop,but with the additional component of profit.id.e.
commerce determines a respondent dumping margin by calculating the amount by which nv exceeds ep.commerce generally calculates ep to be the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold to an unaffiliated purchaser in the united states,subject to several possible adjustments.at issue in this case is what is known as the duty drawback adjustment.the statute provides that ep shall be increased by the amount of any import duties imposed by the country of exportation which have been rebated,or which have not been collected,by reason of the exportation of the subject merchandise to the united states id.c b.in other words,if a foreign country would normally impose an import duty on an input used to manufacture the subject merchandise,but offers a rebate or exemption from the duty if the input is exported to the united states,then commerce will increase ep to account for the rebated or unpaid import duty the duty drawback.
the purpose of the duty drawback adjustment is to account for the fact that the producers remain subject to the import duty when they sell the subject merchandise domestically,which increases home market sales prices and thereby increases nv.that is,when a duty drawback is granted only for exported inputs,the cost of the duty is reflected in nv but not in ep.the statute corrects this imbalance,which could otherwise lead to an inaccurately high dumping margin,by increasing ep to the level it likely would be absent the duty drawback.see hornos electricos de venezuela united states,d.int l trade see also,at in order that any drawback given by the country of exportation upon the exportation of merchandise shall not constitute dumping,it is necessary also to add such items to the purchase price.
saha manufactures carbon steel pipe in thailand using inputs of steel coil and zinc that it imports into thailand.the thai government normally imposes import duties on steel coil and zinc.however,since,saha has participated in thailand bonded warehouse program under which imported materials that are incorporated into final products to be exported are exempt from import duties.under this program,a manufacturer that imports and stores goods in an approved bonded warehouse need not pay any import duties at the time of entry into thailand.the duty exemptions become permanent if the manufacturer exports the imported into finished products or one year.
in the administrative review here,commerce determined that saha received duty exemptions under thailand bonded warehouse program for its inputs of steel coil and zinc that saha incorporated into the carbon steel pipes it exported to the united states.see final results at adopting issues and decision memorandum for the final results of the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from thailand,itadoc,wl,available at hereinafter i d memorandum i d memorandum at.commerce accordingly granted saha a duty drawback adjustment pursuant to c b and increased saha ep to account for the unpaid duty.final results at i d memorandum at.in calculating the adjustment,commerce used saha actual yield factors the input amounts of steel and zinc used to manufacture each unit of carbon steel pipe,the subject merchandise.final results at i d memorandum at.
in addition to increasing ep,commerce included the exempted import duties in saha cost of manufacture,thereby increasing both saha cop and cv.final results at i d memorandum at.in deciding to include the exempted import duties in cop and cv,commerce reasoned that,since we are adjusting ep for the duty exemption,we must account for the related duties that would have been incurred on saha imported inputs.i d memorandum at.moreover,because of its policy of calculating a single cop both for exported and domestically sold products,and because there were no duty exemptions for the inputs of carbon steel pipe sold in thailand,commerce reasoned that the cost of the exempted duties should be included in saha cost of manufacture.id.
both saha and the domestic producers challenged commerce final results in the trade court.the domestic producers contended that commerce erred in granting a duty drawback raising saha account for exempted import duties that saha never actually paid.saha argued that commerce properly raised its ep,but erred in including the exempted import duties in its cop and cv.saha additionally challenged commerce application of saha actual yield factors when calculating the drawback adjustment instead of the yield factors established by the thai government.
the trade court sustained commerce decision in all respects save for the yield factor issue,and it remanded to commerce for recalculation of the dumping margin using the yield factors established by the thai government.see saha thai steel pipe public united states,slip,wl.int l trade.saha does not contest the yield factor issue in the present appeal.on remand,commerce reduced saha dumping margin from percent to percent.joint app.the trade court thereafter sustained commerce remand redetermination and entered a final judgment.see saha thai steel pipe public united states,slip,wl.int l trade.saha and the domestic producers each filed timely appeals,which have been consolidated.we have jurisdiction pursuant to u.a.
discussion 
in reviewing the trade court decision to affirm commerce final determination,we apply anew the trade court standard of review thus,we will uphold commerce determination unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.micron,united states,quoting b b i.
we first address the domestic producers contention that commerce erred in granting saha a duty drawback adjustment.in determining whether a duty drawback adjustment is warranted,commerce applies a test under which the respondent is required to demonstrate 
that the rebate and import duties are dependent upon one another,or in the context of an exem
