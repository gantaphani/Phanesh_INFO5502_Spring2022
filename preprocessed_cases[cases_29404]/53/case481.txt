generally,american industries may petition for relief from imports that are sold in the united states at less than fair value dumped allegheny ludlum united states,citing.commerce determines whether sales have been made at less than fair value,whereas the commission determines whether the imported merchandise materially injures or threatens to materially injure the pertinent domestic industry.id.b.if both inquiries are answered in the affirmative,commerce issues the relevant antidumping duty order.id.c.
an antidumping investigation is typically initiated when a domestic industry files a petition requesting that commerce conduct an investigation into possible dumping.duferco steel,united states.the petition initially determines the scope of the investigation.section b of title provides that the petition may be amended at such time and upon such terms as commerce and the commission may permit.commerce makes an initial determination as to whether the petition contains information supporting the allegations.id.c a i.commerce then must make a preliminary determination of whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that or suspect that the merchandise is being sold,or is likely to be sold,at less than fair value.id.b a.
at the same time that commerce is making its preliminary determination as to sales at less than fair value,the commission must make a preliminary determination as to whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the united states is materially injured or is threatened with material injury by reason of imports of the subject merchandise and that imports of the subject merchandise are not negligible.id.a.imports of subject merchandise from a country are negligible if they account for less than percent of the volume of all such merchandise imported into the united states during the relevant period.id.a i.section a of title,however,contains an exception with respect to negligibility.imports of subject merchandise from a country that would otherwise be negligible because they account for less than three percent of all such imports are not negligible if the total volume of imports of subject merchandise from all countries under investigation having imports not exceeding three percent exceeds seven percent of the volume of all such merchandise imported into the united states.id.a ii.if the commission determines that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible,the antidumping investigation is terminated.id.a.the term subject merchandise is defined as the class or kind of merchandise that is within the scope of an investigation id.

negligibility was the critical issue before the commission in its preliminary investigation in the wire rod case.in order to make a determination with respect to negligibility in a given case,the commission examines official import statistics for the subject merchandise for the most recent period for which data is available.a i.
the confidential staff report in connection with the commission preliminary investigation the staff report was released to the parties on october,three days prior to the vote of the commission on the preliminary injury determination.see.the staff report contained import data from august through july.the report stated that imports from three of the twelve countries under investigation were negligible.those countries and their share of total imports of wire rod were as follows egypt,south africa,and venezuela.id.the total share of wire rod imports from those three countries was thus.i,d at.the staff report also stated that imports of wire rod from germany were of total imports,making its share above the negligibility threshold.id.according to the staff report,egypt,south africa,and venezuela were the only three countries from which imports of wire rod were less than three percent.because the aggregate of imports of wire rod from egypt,south africa,and venezuela was less than seven percent,the staff report stated that imports of wire rod from those countries were negligible under a.
on october,the same day that the staff report was released,sent the commission a letter advising that had that day asked commerce to modify the scope of the wire rod investigation.in its october letter to commerce,identified the products that it was requesting be excluded from the scope of the investigation.requested that 
the scope of the investigation hereby be amended to exclude certain grade tire cord and tire bead quality wire rod actually used in the production of tire cord and bead.the products intended to be excluded are high carbon,high tensile grade wire rod that is used to produce tire cord and tire bead.no other tire cord or bead grade wire rod is excluded from the scope,and any product,regardless of grade,that is used for an application other than tire cord or bead is specifically included in scope unless otherwise specifically excluded 
in its october letter to the commission,stated that the requested scope modification could have significant impact on the commission consideration of the preliminary determination.maintained that its proposed scope modification,which would exclude certain grade tire cord wire rod and tire bead wire rod from the investigation,would result in subject wire rod imports from germany falling below the three percent threshold for negligibility.argued that because such imports from germany would fall below three percent,they would be found to be negligible.consequently,they would be combined with imports of wire rod from egypt,south africa,and venezuela,the result being that imports from all four countries combined would exceed the seven percent aggregate test and thus be found to be.under these circumstances,wrote,the commission should not terminate the investigation as to any of the countries for reasons of negligibility because there is a substantial likelihood that no country will be negligible under a ii.stated that the commission had not collected information on imports of the products that would likely be excluded should commerce make the requested scope modification and that the only record evidence that exists is petitioners good faith estimates,based on their market knowledge and discussion with industry participants,that the total imports of such excluded products is about net tons per year,approximately net tons of which are supplied by germany.
on october,the commission concluded,in a preliminary determination,that subject wire rod imports from egypt,south africa,and venezuela were negligible for purposes of its material injury analysis.the commission noted that,although had requested that commerce exclude from the scope of investigation certain grade wire rod,commerce had not acted on the request.preliminary determination,usitc pub.at.the commission determined that request to commerce and its related assertions were not sufficient to cause the commission to conclude that evidence contrary to that already gathered would arise in any final phase of the investigation.in response to october letter,the commission stated 
petitioners acknowledge that the only record evidence regarding the effect of this proposed exclusion is petitioners good faith estimate based on their market knowledge and discussion with industry participants.petitioners october,letter at.further,petitioners state in the request to commerce,attached to their october,letter,that they are aware of the department commerce general reluctance to use to define scope of coverage petitioners october,letter,attachment at.
id.at.the commission further stated 
i t is speculative that commerce will amend the scope as petitioners wish.moreover,it is speculative that amending the scope will likely result in finding that no country subject imports are negligible.we make our negligibility determinations based on the scope and factual record before us,not speculation.we conclude that petitioners request to commerce and their related assertions are not sufficient to conclude that contrary evidence to that already gathered on these issues,which soundly supports our negligibility determinations,would arise in any final phase of these investigations.
thus,the commission based its negligibility determination on the factual record before it,refusing to speculate as to whether commerce would amend the scope of the investigation.id.the commission also concluded that imports of subject wire rod from egypt,south africa,and venezuela would not imminently exceed the negligibility threshold of three percent individually or seven percent in the aggregate.id.at.in addition to its negligibility determinations with respect to egypt,south africa,and venezuela,the commission made affirmative material injury determinations with respect to the other subject countries,including germany based upon the preliminary determination,commerce terminated the investigation of imports of wire rod from egypt,south africa,and venezuela.preliminary determination order.at.
on october,filed suit in the court of international trade challenging the findings of the preliminary determination insofar as they related to egypt,south africa,and venezuela.before the court of international trade,argued that commerce termination of the wire rod investigation as to egypt,south africa,and venezuela was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.in making that argument,advanced three contentions.first,it pointed out that,pursuant to a i,the commission was required to base its negligibility determination on the most recent period for which data was available that preceded the filing of the petitions.argued that the commission violated the statute by basing its negligibility determination on the period august through july,rather than the period july through june.second,urged that the commission determination that imports from egypt,south africa,and venezuela would not imminently exceed the statutory negligibility threshold was erroneous.argued that if subject imports of wire rod from germany were to fall below three percent,they would be found negligible.being found negligible,such imports would be aggregated with those of the other three countries found to be negligible,egypt,south africa,and venezuela.under these circumstances,stated,imports of wire rod from egypt,south africa,venezuela,and germany would exceed the limit for negligibility in a ii because the total of all such imports from those four countries would be greater than seven percent.finally,argued that the commission had erred in concluding that there was no reasonable indication that imports from egypt,south africa,and venezuela would imminently exceed statutory negligibility levels,whether considered individually or collectively.
while suit was pending,commerce continued its antidumping and countervailing duty investigations as to imports of wire rod from countries with respect to which the commission had made preliminary determinations of material injury.those countries were brazil,canada,germany,indonesia,mexico,moldova,trinidad and tobago,and ukraine.during this period,several scope modification requests were sent to commerce,including an additional scope modification request from in november of.commerce ultimately modified the scope of the antidumping investigation in april of in a manner similar,but not identical,to the scope modification requested in october,letter.
on june,the court of international trade issued its opinion in ruling on motion for judgment on the administrative record,the court first rejected contention that,in making its preliminary determination of negligibility,the commission had improperly relied on data from the period august through july.the court then turned to argument based upon imports of wire rod from egypt,south africa,and venezuela being aggregated with those from germany if wire rod imports from that country were found to be less than three percent.the court noted that,prior to the scope revision,germany share of imports of wire rod,at,was extremely close to the negligibility threshold of a i.the court further noted that while the commission was aware of scope modification request submitted to commerce,the request was not resolved until after the preliminary determination order.the court observed that the commission was left to consider the matter upon representation that the only record evidence regarding the impact of the requested exclusion of products from the scope of investigation was good faith estimate.under these circumstances,the court granted motion to remand the case back to the commission for it to consider the change in scope.referring to the modification of the scope of the investigation in,the court stated 
the court has no way of finally resolving now this circumstance it can not completely overlook this development in regular course,given the nature of the plaintiffs claims and defendant stated recognition herein that it must defer to commerce definition of the scope of the investigation.the court also can not overlook the statement of administrative action that advised of an intent to preclude termination of a preliminary investigation when,for example,i mports are extremely close to the relevant quantitative thresholds and there is a reasonable indication that data obtained in a final investigation will establish that imports exceed the quantitative thresholds.
i,d at citations omitted.in its decision in i,the court of international trade did not address contention that the commission had erred in concluding that there was no reasonable indication that wire rod imports from egypt,south africa,and venezuela would imminently exceed statutory negligibility levels,whether considered individually or collectively.
in due course,the commission moved for reconsideration.in its motion,the commission argued that requiring it to consider developments jeopardized the finality of preliminary determinations and required it to consider evidence in making its preliminary determination.the court of international trade denied the motion on august,noting that commerce had modified the scope,as to apparently undermine,on the commission record developed,the terminations of the investigations,and that the commission had conceded that it had to defer to commerce modified scope.raritan,et int l trade comm n,at.int l trade.
on remand,the commission interpreted i as directing the commission to conduct further investigations to answer the court,does commerce modified scope of investigation issued in april alter germany share of total imports remand determination,usitc pub,at.as a result,the commission reopened the record and gathered additional import data consistent with the modified scope of investigation.this changed the negligibility determination.under the scope of the investigation as modified,subject wire rod imports from germany were found to be less than three percent of total wire rod imports.at the same time,subject wire rod imports from egypt,south africa,and venezuela all remained below three percent of the total amount of such imports.aggregated,subject wire rod imports from all four countries were found to exceed seven percent of total imports of wire rod.accordingly,the commission found subject wire rod imports from egypt,south africa,and venezuela to be under a ii for purposes of its material injury analysis.id.at.after analyzing imports of wire rod from egypt,south africa,and venezuela,the commission made an affirmative determination as to material injury w e determine pursuant to the court order,that there is a reasonable indication that the domestic industry producing wire rod is materially injured by reason of imports of wire rod from egypt,south africa and venezuela that are allegedly sold in the united states at less than fair value.id.at.the court of international trade affirmed the remand determination on september,in ii this appeal followed.
by order dated october,we requested briefing from the parties on i our jurisdiction in this matter and ii the jurisdiction of the court of international trade to review the commission affirmative preliminary determination that followed the court remand order in see bender williamsport area school,d every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction even though the parties are prepared to concede it.citations omitted nystrom trex.before turning to the merits,we address these two jurisdictional questions.we consider first the question of our jurisdiction.
our authority to review decisions of the court of international trade is set forth at a.that statute provides that the federal circuit has exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal of a final decision of the court of international trade.a final decision is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute judgment.cunningham hamilton county,ohio,d quoting catlin united states.the decision of the court of international trade in ii was a final decision because it ended the litigation that began with the filing of complaint challenging the commission negative preliminary determination.we therefore have jurisdiction over alexandria and sidor appeals.
contends,however,that ii was not a final decision because it did not terminate all agency proceedings.points out that the commission affirmative preliminary determination on remand did not end the antidumping investigation.instead,it brought back to life the parallel investigations by commerce and the commission that had been terminated following the preliminary determination 
once the commission changed its position on remand and issued an affirmative preliminary determination,however,there was no longer a final decision by the commission because the case was no longer terminated.rather,further action by the commission and commerce was required under the statutory scheme.see.
under these circumstances,asserts,the decision of the court of international trade in ii was not a final decision within the meaning of a.accordingly,we are without jurisdiction in the case.in making that argument,relies upon jeannette sheet glass united states.we are not persuaded by arguments.
the court of international trade exercised jurisdiction in i pursuant to a c,which is section of the tariff act of.pursuant to c,the court of international trade has exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced under section of the tariff act of.section a c provides that,within thirty days of the publication in the federal register of a negative preliminary determination by the commission,
an interested party who is a party to the proceeding in connection with which the matter arises may commence an action in the united states court of international trade by filing concurrently a summons and a complaint,each with the content and in the form,manner,and style prescribed by the rules of that court,contesting any factual findings or legal conclusions upon which the determination is based.
the statute further provides that,in any action brought under a c,the court of international trade shall hold unlawful any determination found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b a.thus,congress created a cause of action pursuant to which an interested party may challenge,in the court of international trade,a negative preliminary determination by the commission in this case,took advantage of a c to bring a suit to challenge the commission finding that imports of wire rod from egypt,south africa,and venezuela were negligible,the finding that led to the commission negative preliminary determination as to material injury.that suit proceeded through the remand order in i and ended with the decision in ii that affirmed the commission affirmative preliminary determination on remand as to material injury.the case concluded in the court of international trade when the court entered judgment pursuant to its rule.see.of int l trade rule a judgment,decree or final order shall be entered upon every final decision from which an appeal lies.the decision of the court of international trade was,in all respects,a final decision within the meaning of a.
is correct that the effect of the commission affirmative preliminary determination would be to reinstate the antidumping investigation that had been terminated by the commission original negative preliminary determination,subject to the resolution of any appeal taken to this court.see c hosiden,at.however,is not correct in arguing that the affirmative preliminary determination cut off the right of alexandria and sidor to appeal the final decision of the court of international trade in ii.had the court of international trade affirmed the commission original negative preliminary determination,would have had the right to appeal to this court from the adverse ruling in the litigation it had initiated.see.crushed stone united states.in the absence of clear and express statutory language,we are not prepared to hold that congress gave antidumping petitioners the right to bring actions challenging negative preliminary determinations,but at the same time intended that only such not intervenors or the have the right to appeal adverse decisions in such actions.the supreme court has stated that only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.lindahl opm,d quoting abbott labs.gardner,d.the fact that an original affirmative preliminary determination is not independently appealable to the court of international trade does not satisfy this requirement.in short,clear and convincing evidence of legislative intent to allow only antidumping petitioners to appeal adverse decisions of the court of international trade in actions brought under a c is not present 
finally,jeannette does not help.in that case,jeannette sheet glass jeannette filed a petition with the commission and commerce alleging that imports of thin sheet glass tsg at less than fair value from switzerland,belgium,and the federal republic of germany were materially injuring or threatening to injure materially the domestic industry.after conducting a preliminary investigation,the commission made two negative preliminary determinations.first,it concluded that there was no reasonable indication that the domestic regular quality tsg industry was materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports of regular quality tsg from the three named countries allegedly sold at less than fair value.second,the commission concluded that there was no reasonable indication that the establishment of a high quality tsg industry in the united states was being materially retarded by reason of high quality tsg from belgium or the federal republic of germany allegedly being sold at less than fair value.jeannette,at.
jeannette challenged both negative preliminary determinations in the court of international trade.by order dated march,the court affirmed the commission determination of no material retardation in the establishment of a high quality tsg industry in the united states.id.at.in the same order,however,the court held that the reasonable indication standard used by the commission in determining that there was no material injury in the regular quality tsg industry was inconsistent with the standard mandated by the court in republic steel united states.int l trade.as a result,the court remanded the case to the commission to reconsider its preliminary no injury determination in light of republic steel.jeannette.at.thereafter,on july,the commission on remand applied the republic steel standard and arrived at an affirmative preliminary injury determination.that determination was affirmed by the court of international trade in an order issued on september.however,the court of international trade did not issue a final judgment in the case pursuant to rule.id.at.neither did the court issue a judgment pursuant to its rule b 
jeannette filed an initial appeal of the court of international trade march,order insofar as it affirmed the preliminary determination of no material retardation in the high quality tsg industry.the appeal was docketed as.subsequently,on jeannette motion,the appeal was stayed pending resolution in the court of international trade of the remainder of the case pertaining to material injury in the regular quality tsg industry.id.after the court of international trade issued its order of september,jeannette appealed from that part of the order that related to material retardation.the appeal was docketed in this court as and was consolidated with.in due course,glaverbel,glaverbel,an in the case,moved to dismiss jeannette appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the september,order of the court of international trade was interlocutory.id.
meanwhile,on august,while glaverbel motion to dismiss was pending,the commission filed a motion for reconsideration in the court of international trade.in asking the court to reconsider its september order,the commission pointed out that on february,the federal circuit,in american lamb united states,had rejected the reasonable indication standard adopted by the court of international trade in republic steel.as noted above,the basis for the court of international trade march,remand of the material injury issue to the commission was its determination that the commission had misapplied the republic steel standard.jeannette,at.
on october,while the commission motion for reconsideration still was pending before the court of international trade,and while a final judgment still had not been entered in the court of international trade pursuant to the court rule,the federal circuit ruled on glaverbel motion to dismiss.id.at.the court first stated that the court of international trade september,order was not a final decision of the court for purposes of appellate review 
though the september order affirmed the commission preliminary injury determination,it was not final because further proceedings at the agency level were necessary before the case became final.thus,a final determination of no injury had to be made at the commission and a preliminary and final determination of less than fair value had to be made at the international trade administration of the department of commerce.
from that the court posited that the issue before it was the same with respect to both the march,and september,orders whether jeannette can seek to appeal the final part of an order comprising a final and a part.id.the court continued that these two parts were essentially dispositions of two claims within the scope of rule b of the court of international trade.according to the court,the claim related to dumping regular quality tsg at less than fair value material injury claim,while the final claim concerned dumping high quality tsg at less than fair value material retardation claim.stated the court that is the classic situation for rule b certification,yet there was none here.without it,the appeal must be dismissed.id.the court further stated 
also relevant to our decision is that the trial judge has before him the commission motion to reconsider,in light of this court decision in american lamb,the injury aspect of the case and to affirm the commission earlier holding of no preliminary injury.resolution of that motion in the commission favor could speed up greatly the material injury aspect of this case,leading to that aspect and material injury being before us in the near future.
id.at.the court granted glaverbel motion to dismiss and dismissed the appeal without prejudice to the court of international trade certifying the case pursuant to its rule b.
in relying on jeannette,points to the court statement quoted above that the court of international trade september,order was not a final order.it contends that the statement compels dismissal of alexandria and sidor appeals.it asserts that,in view of the commission affirmative preliminary determination on remand,the antidumping investigation process must now proceed to a final determination before there can be any further judicial proceedings.see a b i,ii providing for review in the court of international trade of final affirmative and negative determinations by commerce and the commission under,respectively.
the problem with argument is that the statement from jeannette upon which it relies is dictum.the word dicta is an abbreviation for obiter dicta,which describes statements made by a court that are unnecessary to the decision in the case,and therefore not precedential though they may be considered persuasive.black law dictionary ed.dictum includes a remark made or opinion expressed by a judge,in his decision upon a cause,by the way that is,incidentally or collaterally,and not directly upon the question before the court or it is any statement of law enunciated by the judge or court merely by way of illustration,argument,analogy,or suggestion id.quoting william lile et,brief making and the use of law books ed.because statements made in dicta do not implicate the substantive holding of the case,they can not be considered binding authority.kastigar united states,d see also smith orr,it is well established that a general expression in an opinion,which expression is not essential to the disposition of the case,does not control a judgment in a subsequent proceeding.
the jeannette court statement with respect to the absence of final determinations by commerce and the commission was dictum.it was dictum because it was unnecessary for the court correct holding that the september,decision of the court of international trade was not a final decision of the court so as to confer jurisdiction upon the federal circuit under a.at the time jeannette was decided,there was no final decision of the court of international trade.as the federal circuit decision recognizes,not only had a final judgment not been entered in the court of international trade with respect to the material retardation issue the march,order,but there was pending before the court of international trade the commission motion for reconsideration relating to the material injury issue based upon american lamb.in short,it could not be said that the september order end ed the litigation on the merits and le ft nothing for the court to do but execute judgment.cunningham,at.quoting catlin,at.indeed,in its final decision in jeannette,the court of international trade affirmed the commission original negative preliminary determination and vacated its affirmance of the remand determination.see jeannette sheet glass united states.int l trade.under these circumstances,it was not necessary for the jeannette court to speak to whether it would have jurisdiction only following a decision by the court of international trade following a final determination by the commission,because there was not yet a final decision by the court of international trade compelling a final determination process before the commission.in short,jeannette does not support argument that we lack jurisdiction because there has not been a final decision of the court of international trade within the meaning of a.we turn now to the second jurisdictional question that is before us whether the court of international trade had authority in ii to review the commission affirmative preliminary determination that followed the court remand order in 
argues that the court of international trade did not have authority to review the commission affirmative preliminary determination on remand because under a c,judicial review is permitted only of negative preliminary determinations by the commission.for the reasons that follow,we do not agree.
it is true that does not authorize the review of an affirmative preliminary determination.however,as discussed above,the statute does grant the court of international trade jurisdiction to review a negative preliminary determination.see a c.crushed stone,at.thus,the court of international trade properly exercised jurisdiction in i.it is for this reason that the court had jurisdiction to review the remand determination.the decision of the court in i was not a final decision because,rather than ending the litigation,it remanded the matter to the commission for further proceedings.see viraj group,united states,stating that the general rule is that decisions by a court remanding a matter to an agency are and not appealable to a reviewing court jeannette,at order of the court of international trade remanding matter to the commission for reconsideration of preliminary no injury determination not final.thus,in considering the remand determination,the court of international trade merely continued to adjudicate the same case that had been properly presented to it as an appeal from a negative preliminary determination and that was not yet final.in other words,the court authority to review the remand determination in ii derived from the proper exercise of its jurisdiction in see roquette freres united states,cit,wl.int l trade explaining that once an action has commenced,the court of international trade jurisdiction is continuing,notwithstanding the fact that the court remanded the action to the itc for further determination.the determinations in i and ii are thus properly thought of as decisions stemming from the same jurisdictional root,rather than as separate proceedings,each requiring an independent jurisdictional basis.see c granting the court of international trade exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced under emphasis added.we note that we implied as much in bingham taylor division united states.thus,the court of international trade properly exercised jurisdiction in ii.
the court of international trade reviews a commission determination under the standard of review set forth in b.crushed stone,at.under that standard,a preliminary determination by the commission must be upheld unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b a.we review a decision of the court of international trade by applying for ourselves the statute standard of review to the commission determination.crushed stone,at.in applying that standard,
we must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment although the inquiry into the facts is to be searching and careful,the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one.the court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.

under amended a,the commission in preliminary investigations will determine whether there is a reasonable indication that imports are not negligible.the commission standard regarding negligible imports in preliminary investigations shall be the same as its standard for material injury determinations in these investigations,as set forth in american lamb united states.the amendments,however,are not intended to limit the commission ability to use reasonable estimates in calculating whether import volumes are negligible.the amendments are,however,intended to preclude termination based on negligibility in a preliminary investigation where,for example the commission is uncertain regarding appropriate like product designations and corresponding import volumes are not negligible with respect to one of the arguable appropriate designations or imports are extremely close to the relevant quantitative thresholds and there is a reasonable indication that data obtained in a final investigation will establish that imports exceed the quantitative thresholds.
in american lamb,the case referenced in the saa,three domestic lamb producers filed petitions with the commission and commerce,alleging that imports of lamb meat from new zealand were being subsidized and then sold in the united states at less than fair value.american lamb,at.in due course,the commission made a preliminary determination of no material injury.id.one of the domestic producers sought review of the negative preliminary determination in the court of international trade.it argued that the case should be remanded to the commission because,in making its determination,the commission had weighed conflicting evidence,contrary to the decision of the court of international trade in republic steel united states.int l trade.in republic steel,the court of international trade remanded to the commission two determinations in countervailing duty investigations because the commission had weighed conflicting evidence in making a negative preliminary determination.in doing so,the court stated the object of those determinations should have been simply to find whether there were any facts which raised the possibility of injury.the resolution or interpretation of conflicting facts should have been reserved for a possible final injury determination.republic steel.at.thus,in republic steel,the court of international trade set forth the possibility of injury as the standard to be applied by the commission in making a preliminary determination as to material injury.
in american lamb,the court of international trade agreed with the domestic lamb producer that the commission had improperly weighed conflicting evidence.accordingly,it remanded the case in light of republic steel,instructing the commission to reconsider the preliminary determination.american lamb,at.however,the court certified its order pursuant to d in order to allow the commission to challenge the republic steel rule in the federal circuit on interlocutory appeal.
we granted the commission petition to accept the interlocutory appeal.considering the case on the merits,we rejected the court of international trade possibility of injury standard in the setting of a preliminary injury determination.we stated 
the commission has consistently viewed the statutory reasonable indication standard as one requiring that it issue a negative determination only when the record as a whole contains clear and convincing evidence that there is no material injury or threat of such injury and no likelihood exists that contrary evidence will arise in a final investigation.that view,involving a process of weighing the evidence,but under guidelines requiring clear and convincing evidence of no reasonable indication,and no likelihood of later contrary evidence,provides fully adequate protection against unwarranted terminations.indeed,those guidelines weight the scales in favor of affirmative and against negative determinations.
id.at emphasis in original.continuing,we stated that we were unable to join the court of international trade in its view that the statutory phrase reasonable indication means the same as mere possibility,or that it suggests only the barest clues or signs needed to justify further inquiry.the statute calls for a reasonable indication of injury,not a reasonable indication of need for further inquiry.id.accordingly,we overruled republic steel and remanded the case to the court of international trade with the instruction that the court vacate its decision in american lamb.id.at.
on appeal,appellants and the commission urge the reversal of the decision of the court of international trade in ii.in doing so,they contend that the court remand in i was improper.they argue that the remand was contrary to the plain language of a and that,under the standard of texas crushed stone,the preliminary determination was rational and in accordance with law,and therefore should have been affirmed.
the commission urges that information available in a refers to information gathered within the day time period for conducting a preliminary investigation.in advancing this argument,the commission points to our statement in american lamb that considering and weighing,under commission guidelines,all evidence gathered within the days available for conducting a preliminary investigation effectuates legislative intent.id.at.the commission states that the court of international trade erred in not considering whether the commission,at the time of the preliminary determination,october,had acted in a manner that was consistent with the american lamb standard.it is the commission position that the court of international trade acted contrary to law in i by relying on commerce subsequent modification of the scope of the investigation 
for its part,urges affirmance of ii.citing american lamb,it argues that only if there is clear and convincing evidence to support the commission decision,and there is no likelihood of later contrary evidence,can the commission reach a negative preliminary determination.id.at.points out that there was evidence before the commission that,during the relevant period,venezuela share of total imports of subject wire rod was,while egypt was and south africa was,for a combined total of.also points out that there was evidence before the commission that germany share of the total amount of subject wire rod imports was,putting it extremely close to the three percent threshold for negligibility.argues that these facts,combined with the fact that the commission was aware that had requested a scope modification,meant that,at the time of the preliminary determination,there was a reasonable indication that subject wire rod imports from germany would be found negligible.this would mean that wire rod imports from germany would be aggregated with those from egypt,south africa,and venezuela,the result being that such wire rod imports from all four countries would exceed seven percent,so that imports from each country would be found.asserts that,under these circumstances,it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,and otherwise not in accordance with law for the commission to determine that there was clear and convincing evidence that subject wire rod imports from egypt,south africa,and venezuela were negligible and that no likelihood existed that such imports would be determined to be in the final determination.finally,contends that borlem industriais united states,supports the court of international trade reliance on commerce subsequent modification of the scope of the investigation.
in arguing that the preliminary determination was defective,does not renew the contention that was rejected in the court of international trade that the commission erred in basing its negligibility determination on data from the period august through july.however,does urge that if we find the court of international trade erred in i,the proper course is to vacate ii and remand the case so that the court of international trade can address the issue of whether the commission erred in concluding that there was no reasonable indication that wire rod imports from egypt,south africa,and venezuela would imminently exceed the statutory threshold for negligibility.states the lower court did not address these issues given its decision finding error with respect to the american lamb issue.appellants and the commission do not challenge that statement.
the antidumping statute states that the commission is to make its preliminary determination based on the information available to it at the time of the determination.a.that means that the commission must render its preliminary determination based on the information available to it within the day period following the filing of an antidumping petition.id.a a i.t he commission will investigate the allegations in the petition in as thorough a manner as possible using the information available within that time period american lamb,at quoting,at 
in the preliminary determination,the commission concluded,for purposes of its material injury analysis,that wire rod imports from egypt,south africa,and venezuela were negligible.in reaching that conclusion,the commission noted that,based on,had requested that commerce modify the scope of the investigation to exclude from the investigation certain grade tire cord wire rod and certain grade tire bead wire rod.the commission also noted assertion that if commerce modified the scope of the investigation,wire rod imports from germany would be negligible and thus would be aggregated with wire rod imports from egypt,south africa,and venezuela,with the result that the seven percent aggregate threshold for negligibility would be exceeded.preliminary determination at.at the same time,however,the commission pointed out that acknowledged that the only record evidence regarding the effect of the proposed scope exclusion was petitioners good faith estimate,based on their market knowledge and discussion with industry participants.id.the commission also pointed out that acknowledged in its october request to commerce that it was aware of commerce reluctance to rely on to define scope coverage.id.under these circumstances,the commission stated,it is speculative that commerce will amend the scope as petitioners wish.moreover,it is speculative that amending the scope will likely result in finding that no country subject imports are negligible.id.the commission concluded 
we make our negligibility determinations based on the scope and factual record before us,not speculation.we conclude that petitioners request to commerce and their related assertions are not sufficient to conclude that contrary evidence to that already gathered on these issues,which soundly supports our negligibility determinations,would arise in any final phase of these investigations.
the commission made its preliminary determination in a manner fully consistent with a.the commission rendered the preliminary determination in light of the facts as they existed at the time when the commission was required to vote.it was not until april of,six months later,that commerce modified the scope of the investigation.we see no reason to fault the commission for concluding that request to commerce to change the scope of the investigation and the assertions in its october letter to the commission were insufficient to compel a preliminary determination of.the commission finding in the preliminary determination that imports of wire rod from egypt,south africa,and venezuela were negligible was not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or contrary to law.
relying on american lamb,however,argues that only if there is clear and convincing evidence to support the commission decision,and there is no likelihood of later contrary evidence,can the commission reach a preliminary negative determination.american lamb,at emphasis by.according to,its request that commerce modify the scope of the antidumping investigation eliminated the possibility of the commission concluding that there was no likelihood that evidence that imports of wire rod from egypt,south africa,and venezuela were not negligible would arise in a final investigation.id.
we are not persuaded by this argument.we stated in american lamb that the commission has consistently viewed the statutory reasonable indication standard as one requiring that it issue a negative determination only when the record as a whole contains clear and convincing evidence that there is no material injury or threat of such injury.id.emphasis added the record as a whole refers to the record at the time the commission renders its preliminary determination in a case.in our view,the fact that,three days before the commission was to vote,asked commerce to modify the scope of the investigation does not detract from the quantum or the quality of the evidence supporting the commission preliminary determination of negligibility at the time the commission rendered the determination.we are not prepared to the commission refusal to view october letter as tipping the evidence of record toward a reasonable indication that data obtained in the final investigation would result in wire rod imports from egypt,south africa,and venezuela being found not negligible.as we stated in american lamb,a preliminary determination by the commission involves a process of weighing the evidence.id.that is precisely what the commission did in this case.as the record makes clear,it weighed the evidence before it at the time it rendered the preliminary determination order.
we do not agree with that borlem supports the court of international trade consideration of evidence outside the record compiled during the day preliminary investigation,specifically,commerce modification of the scope of the investigation in april of.in borlem,the budd company filed antidumping petitions with commerce and the commission on behalf of the domestic industry producing tubeless steel disc wheel products tsdws.budd alleged that brazilian manufacturers were exporting tsdws to the united states and selling them at less than fair value and that an industry in the united states was threatened with material injury.borlem,at.the only two brazilian manufacturers were borlem industriais borlem and e equipamentos fnv.id.on march,commerce made the final determination that less than fair value dumping margins of and applied to borlem and fnv,respectively.id.subsequently,the commission determined that an industry in the united states was threatened with material injury by reason of the tsdw imports.id.however,after that determination by the commission,commerce issued an antidumping duty order and an amendment to its final determination correcting certain clerical errors.id.
borlem and fnv challenged the final less than fair value determination by commerce in the court of international trade.subsequently,at the request of commerce,the court remanded the final less than fair value determination and antidumping duty order to commerce with the instruction that commerce recalculate borlem and fnv dumping margins and correct all clerical,methodological,and transcription errors.id.the remand resulted in a second amended final less than fair value determination and an amended antidumping duty order finding borlem to have a dumping margin of and fnv a margin of.id.commerce deemed fnv margin de minimis and excluded it from its amended antidumping duty order.id.in the court of international trade,borlem and fnv also challenged the final injury determination by the commission.id.eventually,at the request of the commission,the court of international trade remanded the matter to the commission pursuant to c.the court instructed the commission to decide whether it should reconsider its injury determination in light of commerce final determination.id.at.in due course,the commission reported to the court that,under the circumstances of the case,it did not have authority to reconsider its previous decision.id.at.the court of international trade remanded the matter to the commission once more,however,stating that the commission had the power to exercise discretion to reconsider its determination.subsequently,we granted the commission and the budd company interlocutory review of the court of international trade second remand ruling.one of the two questions certified for interlocutory appeal,and the one pertinent to this case,was 
whether or not the international trade commission has the authority and power to reconsider its final affirmative threat of injury determination,when directed to do so by the court of international trade pursuant to its remand authority under c in light of commerce amended final determination of sales at less than fair value and amended antidumping duty order.
considering the merits,we held that the court of international trade had authority to remand the commission material injury determination.we stated 
the remand authority given to the court by c demonstrates congress concern that the court have appropriate authority in trade cases to deal with the issues that come before it.the fact that,based on the second amended determination,fnv was shown not to be dumping beyond a de minimis amount was of sufficient importance that the commission might have determined that there was no material injury or threat of injury at all.it is understandable and justifiable that the court might wish to remand such a case.
a court is indeed obligated to give deference to an agency acting within its scope of responsibility.however,deference is not owed to a determination that is based on data that the agency generating those data indicates is incorrect.the law does not require,nor would it make sense to require,reliance on data which might lead to an erroneous result.
maintains that,in light of commerce modification of the scope of the investigation in april of,borlem supports the court of international trade remand.misreads borlem.as just seen,our decision in borlem turned on the fact that the final injury determination that the court of international trade directed the commission to reconsider was based upon an incorrect less than fair value determination by commerce.id.we agree with the trial court interpretation of its powers and believe that congress desire for speedy determinations on dumping matters should not be interpreted as authorizing proceedings that are based on inaccurate data.the critical difference between this case and borlem is that the commission preliminary determination was not based on inaccurate data.rather,the scope of the investigation changed after the commission issued the preliminary determination.we agree with the commission that borlem is distinguishable from this case.
we also agree with the commission that vermont yankee nuclear power natural resources defense council,d,supports not extending borlem to the facts of this case.in vermont yankee,the supreme court held that the district of columbia circuit had erred in overturning a decision of the atomic energy commission aec granting a permit for the construction of a nuclear power plant.the circuit decision was based on theories of energy conservation alternatives that only came to be recognized as factors to be considered in granting a permit for the construction of a nuclear power plant after the agency decision at issue in the case.the supreme court held that the aec decision had to be judged by the information available to it at the time of its decision,not post hoc evolving notions of energy conservation alternatives to nuclear plants.id.at.the court stated t he role of a court in reviewing the sufficiency of an agency consideration of environmental factors is a limited one,limited both by the time at which the decision was made and by the statute mandating review.id.at.the rationale of vermont yankee runs counter to the court of international trade consideration in this case of commerce modification of the scope of the antidumping investigation some six months after the preliminary determination.that is particularly so when one remembers that the commission was under a statutory deadline of days to render its preliminary determination.the borlem court distinguished vermont yankee,stating vermont yankee does not preclude remand where the decision under review rests on an erroneous fact.borlem,at.that distinction does not apply here,however.as seen above,the commission preliminary determination in this case was not based on an erroneous fact.
we also think that the interest of finality of agency decisions is best served by not extending borlem to the facts of this case.the supreme court stated in vermont yankee that if litigants could demand rehearing as a matter of law because of new circumstances,new trends or new facts,there would be little hope that the administrative process could ever be consummated in an order that would not be subject to reopening.yankee,at.quoting icc jersey city.we accept as true assertion that when it asked commerce to modify the scope of the antidumping investigation and then informed the commission of the request,it was acting in good faith.however,the fact remains that request came very late in the day.the commission was under a statutory mandate to render its decision within days of the date the original antidumping petitions were filed.when made its scope modification request,the commission had completed its preliminary investigation,the staff report had been issued,and the members of the commission were scheduled to vote on the preliminary determination in just three days.in addition,it was not until april of that commerce actually modified the scope of the investigation.we find much force in the commission argument that if the court of international trade decision in this case is upheld,future petitioners will be encouraged to make similar scope modification requests to commerce,and then argue before the court of international trade for remands and redeterminations based on new developments in the event a scope modification is made by commerce.under these circumstances,we can not escape the conclusion that an affirmance of the decision of the court of international trade in this case would undermine the ability of the commission to arrive at final preliminary determinations in antidumping cases.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that the court of international trade erred in i when it remanded the case to the commission for further consideration in light of commerce modification of the scope of the investigation in april of.accordingly,we vacate the court of international trade decision in ii,which affirmed the commission remand determination.the case is remanded to the court of international trade for further proceedings.in those proceedings,
