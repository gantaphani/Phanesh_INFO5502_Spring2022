repacking expenses 
section c a allows the constructed export price to be reduced by movement expenses.it provides that t he price used to establish export price and constructed export price shall be reduced by 
the amount,if any,included in such price,attributable to any additional costs,charges,or expenses,and united states import duties,which are incident to bringing the subject merchandise from the original place of shipment in the exporting country to the place of delivery in the united states 
a separate provision provides for different treatment of direct selling expenses,which are also used in calculating the constructed export price for purposes of this section,the price used to establish constructed export price shall also be reduced by expenses that result from,and bear a direct relationship to,the sale,such as credit expenses,guarantees and warranties id.d b.
nsk submitted to commerce a list of expenses,which included its repacking expenses.commerce reduced the price of the merchandise for all expenses that nsk listed except its repacking expenses.commerce denied nsk an allowance for the repacking expenses under c a,instead treating nsk repacking expenses as direct selling expenses under d b.final results.at.commerce reasoned that 
we do not view repacking expenses as movement expenses.the repacking of subject merchandise in the united states bears no relationship to moving the merchandise from one point to another.the fact that repacking is not necessary to move merchandise is borne out by the fact that the merchandise was moved from the exporting country to the united states prior to repacking.rather,we view repacking expenses as direct selling expenses respondents incur on behalf of certain sales which we deduct pursuant to section d b of the statute d b 
the court of international trade affirmed.nsk,d at.the court of international trade reasoned that nsk repacking expenses were properly classified as selling expenses because d b did not provide an exhaustive list and was not limited simply to credit expenses,guarantees,and warranties.id.at.the court of international trade concluded that it was reasonable to classify the repacking expenses as selling expenses because the repacking was performed on individual products to facilitate their sale to unaffiliated customers.id.moreover,the court of international trade found that nsk repacking expenses were not incidental to bringing the subject merchandise from the original place of shipment to the place of delivery in the united states,and that commerce thus acted reasonably in refusing to classify the repacking expenses as movement expenses under c a.id.
the parties arguments 
nsk argues that commerce erred in classifying its repacking expenses as selling expenses rather than movement expenses.first,nsk points out that commerce permitted the constructed export price to be reduced by several other types of similar expenses that it concluded were movement expenses under c a.these included japanese inland freight from plant to warehouse,and from warehouse to exit port,international freight,inland freight from entry port to warehouse,and from warehouse to unaffiliated customers,japanese warehousing,marine insurance,brokerage,customs duties,and warehousing.nsk argues that if these categories of expenses were deemed movement expenses under c a,then repacking expenses,which are indistinguishable from other warehousing,handling,and insurance expenses,should also be categorized as movement expenses.
nsk next argues that commerce rationale for treating repacking expenses as transportation expenses can not withstand scrutiny.nsk contends that whether repacking was required to bring merchandise from japan to nsk warehouse is irrelevant.nsk also argues that the repacking expenses were movement expenses because they were necessary to bring the merchandise to the place of delivery in the united states,each customer place of business.nsk points out that repacking was necessary to make the requested quantities of bearings deliverable to customers.finally,nsk argues that commerce contention that repacking was needed to sell the merchandise to an unaffiliated customer is inconsistent with its allowance of inland freight costs as movement expenses,which under commerce reasoning also would be directly
