if one of the above named companies does not qualify for a separate rate,all other exporters of freshwater crawfish tail meat from the people republic of china who have not qualified for a separate rate are deemed to be covered by this review as part of the prc entity of which the named exporter is a part.
as part of the administrative review,the department sent questionnaires to the prc crawfish tail meat exporters specifically identified in the notice of initiation,including.based on response,the department ascertained that there was more than one company named huaiyin foreign trade corporation,and that only was actually entitled to the lower duty margin.
in september of,the department responded to an inquiry from the united states customs service customs by issuing a clarification of message to customs,stating that only was actually entitled to the percent duty margin.as a result,customs assigned the percent duty margin to all of crawfish tail meat entries and required domestic importers of products to post additional cash deposits to cover the increase in duty margin.
on october,the department published the preliminary results of its administrative review,finding that sales of prc crawfish tail meat occurred at below fair value during the review period.notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review and new shipper reviews,partial rescission of the antidumping duty administrative review,and rescission of the new shipper review for yancheng baolong biochemical products,freshwater crawfish tail meat from the people republic of china,preliminary results.the department preliminary results reaffirmed that,given the presumption that the prc is a nonmarket economy,all exporters that did not request or were not able to show an absence of state control would receive the duty margin of percent.id.at.
after receiving comments to the preliminary results from various interested parties,including,the department published the final results of its administrative review.freshwater crawfish tail meat from the people republic of china final results of administrative antidumping duty and new shipper reviews,and final rescission of new shipper review,final results.in the final results,the department determined that was subject to the duty margin of percent,because it did not timely request a separate,duty rate.id.at.moreover,the agency clarified that and the huaiyin foreign trade corporation mentioned in earlier notices and decisions constituted the same entity,and that this entity became subject to the higher duty margin of percent because it failed to adequately prove an absence of state control during this administrative review.id.

when reviewing determinations made by commerce,this court applies anew the standard of review applied by the court of international trade in its review of the administrative record.de cecco di filippo fara martino united states,see also cemex,united states.
as required by statute,we will sustain the agency antidumping determinations unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consol.edison nlrb.we determine the existence of substantial evidence by considering the record as a whole,including evidence that supports as well as evidence that fairly detracts from the substantiality of the evidence.atl.sugar,united states.
in reviewing the department construction of a statute it administers,we defer to the agency reasonable interpretation of the antidumping statutes if not contrary to an unambiguous legislative intent as expressed in the words of the statute.see timex,united states.similarly,we accord substantial deference to the agency interpretations of its own regulations.torrington united states.
advances four contentions in this appeal.it contends that the department failed to comply with the procedures governing the administrative review proceeding and to provide the plaintiff with a meaningful opportunity to participate in the review.it further argues that the agency improperly applied the higher duty margin retroactively by issuing the clarification of message to customs.huaiyin further asserts that a recent statutory change that directs payment of antidumping duties to the domestic industry fundamentally alters the antidumping law into a statute imposing a penalty.we address each contention seriatim.
first ground for reversal focuses on the procedure used to request and initiate the administrative review.relying on a and,it asserts that it is not subject to the results of the review,because it was not named either in the domestic producers request for administrative review or in the department notice of initiation.controlling precedent disposes of this argument.
we recently considered the same contention in transcom,united states,transcom iv.in that case,the department determined that two hong kong resellers of tapered roller bearings from the prc were subject to a dumping margin,causing transcom,one of the resellers bearings importers,to challenge the department determination.id.at.among the arguments it raised on appeal,transcom contended that a company must be specifically named in the request for review and in the notice of initiation before that company may become subject to the results of the administrative review.id.at.
we rejected that argument,because neither the controlling statute nor the applicable regulation supported transcom contention.as we explained 
the governing statute,a,does not limit commerce administrative review to those companies specifically named in the interested party request for review.furthermore,although the applicable regulation requires specificity in a request for review,see a,it places no such limitation on commerce.to the contrary,the regulation authorizes commerce to define the scope of the review independent of the request.id.c.accordingly,we see no statutory or regulatory basis for ruling that when commerce conducts an administrative review in response to a request from an interested party,the scope of the review is limited to the scope of the interested party request.
id.we then underscored that conclusion by considering the agency own interpretation of its regulation,and the regulatory history of that rule.from that inquiry,we determined that n othing in the legislative history of the amendment indicates that it was intended to limit commerce ability to frame administrative reviews more broadly than the triggering requests for review.id.at.accordingly,we held that neither the statute nor the regulation precluded the department inclusion of an entity that was unnamed in the request for review or the notice of initiation of the review.id.
given that instant challenge relies on the same statute and regulatory provision that we interpreted in transcom iv,see antidumping duties countervailing duties,proposed,indicating a recodification of the department existing regulations and stating that new s ection is based largely on existing and,that case interpretation of the applicable statute and regulation necessarily controls here as a matter of stare decisis.see bankers trust united states,holding that this court is bound by its own earlier decisions directly construing a statutory provision.thus,argument is unavailing.it can not avoid the department duty margin simply because it was not specifically named in the request for review or in the notice of initiation.
alternatively,claims that the language in the notice of initiation that purports to conditionally cover its import in the administrative review failed to provide adequate notice and thus deprived it of the opportunity for meaningful participation.we disagree.
in the context of the department administrative review of dumping margins,we have construed the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions as requiring that any reasonably informed party should be able to determine,from the published notice of initiation read in light of announced commerce department policy,whether particular entries in which it has an interest may be affected by the administrative review.transcom,united states,transcom i.thus,the adequacy of administrative review notice depends on the particular language used in the review notice of initiation,as well as the department prevailing review policy at that time.see transcom iv,at.
in transcom i,we ruled that the department antidumping duties were not assessed in accordance with law,because the agency did not specifically name transcom exporters among the entities listed in the published notices of initiation for those reviews.transcom i,at transcom had no reason to expect that the antidumping duties on its exporters products could be affected by proceedings in which the exporters were not named as parties.however,we reaffirmed that the department did not need to provide personal notice of the proceedings,id.at citing goldhofer fahrzeugwerk gmbh united states,and indicated that the agency was free to select a variety of means to give reasonable notice that the goods of unnamed exporters would be subject to the administrative review.id.at.as an example of the various forms of notice available to the agency,we mentioned,without passing on the propriety of that approach,that the department had started to provide in its published notices of initiation that all unnamed exporters would be conditionally covered by the review.id.at.
a subsequent appeal involving the same importer required us to determine whether this conditional coverage form of notice satisfied statutory and regulatory requirements.transcom iv,at.adopted by the agency since,the notice of initiation in that appeal only stated that a ll other exporters of tapered roller bearings are conditionally covered by this review.id.at alteration in original.as later described by the department,this conditional coverage meant that,if one of the companies named in the published notice of initiation did not qualify for a separate rate,all other exporters that have not qualified for a separate rate would be deemed covered by the review.see id.at citing.despite the terse wording of the conditional notice,we ruled that it was consistent with statutory and regulatory provisions.id.at.
in this respect,this case differs significantly from our previous transcom decision,transcom i.the notice of initiation in that case was limited to identifying specific exporters it contained no indication that other,unnamed exporters were subject to the review.as a result,the clear implication of the notice was that parties that were not named in the notice were excluded from the review in this case,by contrast,the notice of initiation advised any entity exporting tapered roller bearings manufactured in china that it was within the scope of the administrative review and would be subject to antidumping duties depending on the outcome of the review process.
id.at.given the adequate notice and the available opportunities to participate in the review,we dismissed transcom claim of unfair surpri
