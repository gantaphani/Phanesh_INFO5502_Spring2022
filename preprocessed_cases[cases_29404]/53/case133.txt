in this case we are called upon to interpret provisions of the tariff act of designed to protect domestic owners of trademarks affixed to goods produced overseas by foreign manufacturers.vittoria north america,vna,an oklahoma limited liability company,alleges that it is the owner of the trademark vittoria,which designates a brand of bicycle tires.vna alleges that imports,a california sole proprietorship,has purchased tires overseas and imported them into the united states in violation of vna trademark rights.vna sued imports and its sole proprietor robert hansing collectively eai under of the tariff act codified at the act seeking damages as well as an injunction to prevent eai from continuing to import vittoria bicycle tires into the united states.the act states 
except as provided in subsection d of this section,it shall be unlawful to import into the united states any merchandise of foreign manufacture if such merchandise,or the label,sign,print,package,wrapper,or receptacle,bears a trademark owned by a citizen of,or by a corporation or association created or organized within,the united states,and registered in the patent and trademark office by a person domiciled in the united states,under the provisions of sections to of title,and if a copy of the certificate of registration of such trademark is filed with the secretary of the treasury,in the manner provided in section of said title,unless written consent of the owner of such trademark is produced at the time of making entry.
in other words,the act provides gray market protection to owners of trademarks associated with goods of foreign manufacture,prohibiting any other person or entity from importing goods bearing that trademark into the united states without the consent of the trademark owner.see,k mart cartier,d.the prototypical gray market victim is a domestic firm that purchases from an independent foreign firm the rights to register and use the latter trademark as a united states trademark and to sell its foreign manufactured products here.id.at.
the district court granted vna partial summary judgment,holding that the evidence showed that vna owns and has properly registered the vittoria trademark in the united states,that bicycle tires are manufactured overseas,and that eai has imported vittoria tires into the united states without vna consent.eai now appeals,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support summary judgment on the issue of whether vna is the owner of the vittoria trademark.eai further argues that vna is not entitled to protection under the act because vna is controlled by the foreign manufacturer of vittoria tires.in addition,eai argues we should reverse because the district court improperly denied it an opportunity to file a surrebuttal to vna reply brief on its motion for summary judgment.we affirm.
background 
on november,vna predecessor hibdon tire center entered into an agreement the agreement with vittoria vittoria italy,a company organized under the laws of italy and with headquarters in bergamo,italy.hibdon tire center agreed to form vna as a north american distributor of vittoria tires,and vittoria italy agreed to designate vna as its exclusive distributor in the united states,canada,and mexico.vna distributed bicycle tires in the united states from that time forward.in february,vittoria italy entered into an agreement assignment agreement with vna purporting to assign vna all right,title and interest in and to the united states trademark vittoria and the registration therefore,together with the goodwill of the business connected with the use of and symbolized by said trademark,as well as the right to sue for infringement of the trademark or injury to said goodwill.the assignment agreement stated that t he purpose of this agreement is to permit assignee vna to act against infringers and unauthorized importers of vittoria trademarked products into the united states.vittoria italy retained the right to retake title to the trademark and its associated goodwill upon giving thirty days written notice to vna.
shortly thereafter,vna filed suit against eai alleging that it infringed on vna trademark rights by importing vittoria tires into the united states without first gaining vna consent.eai concedes that it has been purchasing tires overseas and importing the tires into the united states since the early.vna suit seeks damages,an injunction to prevent further importation by eai,and confiscation of eai inventory of products.
the district court granted vna motion for partial summary judgment,holding that undisputed facts in the case established vna right to protection under.vittoria,euro asia imports,no.a,slip op.at.july.specifically,the district court found that vittoria is a registered united states trademark,id.at,that vittoria italy assigned all of its rights,title and interest in the mark to vna,and that the assignment agreement was recorded in the patent and trademark office,id.the district court also found that vna is not a subsidiary of vittoria italy,and has no common officers or directors with vittoria,id.finally,the district court found that the evidence showed eai had imported and sold products in the united states.id.the district court therefore enjoined eai from further importation of products into the united states,although it did not address the issue of damages in its order.id.at.
eai now appeals the district court injunction.eai contends that the evidence relied upon by the district court was insufficient to prove vna ownership of the vittoria trademark in the united states.further,eai argues that vna is not entitled to protection under the act because it falls under a regulatory exception denying gray market protection to companies if they are owned by or subject to common control with a foreign manufacturer of the trademarked goods.see d.finally,eai argues that the district court erred by failing to grant it leave to file a surrebuttal.
ii.discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to a.in reviewing an injunction,we may also address the summary judgment order that served as the district court principal legal basis for granting the injunction because the district court ruling on summary judgment was inextricably intertwined with its ruling granting a permanent injunction.law collegiate athletic ass n,cir citations omitted.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,and affirm only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also,simms ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.we draw all inferences and construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,kingsford salt lake city sch,cir.
local rule c 
before reaching the merits of the arguments before us,we must briefly consider a threshold issue raised by vna.vna contends that a statement of facts appended to vna summary judgment motion should be construed as true for the purposes of this appeal because eai violated rule c of the local court rules for the western district of oklahoma in crafting its answer brief to the summary judgment motion.rule c reads 
the brief in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or partial summary judgment shall begin with a section which contains a concise statement of material facts to which the party asserts genuine issues of fact exist.each fact in dispute shall be numbered,shall refer with particularity to those portions of the record upon which the opposing party relies,and,if applicable,shall state the number of the movant facts that is disputed.all material facts set forth in the statement of the material facts of the movant shall be deemed admitted for the purpose of summary judgment unless specifically controverted by the statement of material facts of the opposing party.
we have reviewed eai answer brief,and we agree with vna that it deviates from the requirements of rule c in important respects.nevertheless,we note that the district court did not rely on these imperfections in issuing its order,and t his court has recognized that district courts have discretion in applying local rules.hernandez george,cir.moreover,vna itself did not present this argument in its reply brief.walker mather,cir in general,a court of appeals will not consider an issue that was not raised before the district court.accordingly,we hold that eai is not precluded from challenging vna version of events on the basis of its failure to comply with local rule c.
transfer of vittoria trademark to vna 
we next consider eai contention that vna is not entitled to gray market protection under the act.in order to prove entitlement to protection under the act,vna must show that it is a corporation or association created or organized within the united states,that it owns the vittoria trademark in the united states,that the trademark is registered in the patent and trademark office of the united states customs service,and that eai is,without vna consent,importing goods of foreign manufacture.a.the district court found that undisputed evidence sufficiently established each of these points.
eai contests whether the evidence demonstrates that vna owns the vittoria trademark in the united states.first,eai asserts that the transfer was invalid for purposes of establishing any rights to gray market protection because the transaction was not at arm length and because vna did not pay dearly for the assignment.eai relies on k mart cartier,d to support its argument that the act does not extend protection under such circumstances.cartier,however,does not purport to establish requirements for a valid transfer of a trademark.rather,it considers an exception to the act exempting trademark holders from its protections who are owned by or under common control with a foreign manufacturer of trademarked goods.cartier,at.noting that the issue in the case turned on interpretation of.although we consider cartier interpretation of this exception in detail further in this opinion,cartier provides no assistance to eai challenge to whether an actual transfer of a trademark occurred to the putative owner in the first place 
eai next asserts that the transfer was invalid because the assignment agreement failed to transfer the goodwill associated with the trademark along with the trademark itself.courts have consistently held that a valid assignment of a trademark or service mark requires the transfer of the goodwill associated with the mark.see,sands,taylor wood quaker oats,cir t he transfer of a trademark apart from the goodwill of the business which it represents is an invalid naked or in gross assignment,which passes no rights to the assignee.citation and quotations omitted berni int l gourmet rests.of,cir same premier dental,at transfer of goodwill is necessary to transfer ownership of a trademark.a trademark symbolizes the public confidence or goodwill in a particular product.however,it is no more than that,and is insignificant if separated from that confidence.therefore,a trademark is not the subject of property except in connection with an existing business.id.at quoting united drug theodore rectanus.footnote omitted.
eai points to several perceived distinctions between premier dental prods.and the facts of this case to suggest that goodwill did not transfer under the assignment agreement.eai notes that the assignee in premier dental prods.was not created expressly for the purpose of marketing goods bearing the trademark at issue,and that the assignee was the exclusive distributor of such goods in the united states,whereas here vna was created pursuant to the agreement,and vna competed with eai prior to the assignment agreement.moreover,eai points out that it has been distributing bicycle tires in the united states for a longer period of time than vna,and that eai never obtained its products directly from vna.
the purpose for requiring transfer of goodwill along with the transfer of the trade or service mark is to ensure that consumers receive accurate information about the product or service associated with the mark.sugar busters llc brennan,cir the purpose of the rule prohibiting the sale or assignment of a trademark in gross is to prevent a consumer from being misled or confused as to the source and nature of the goods or service that he or she acquires.gallo winery gallo cattle,cir patterson,roman cleanser in re roman cleanser,cir marshak green,cir.
transfer of assets is not a sine qua non for transferring the goodwill associated with a trademark.see sands,taylor wood,at stating that the transfer of a mark need not be accompanied by the transfer of any physical or tangible assets in order to be valid.the restatement third of unfair competition explains 
c ourts now evaluate each assignment in light of the circumstances of the particular case,including both the terms of the transfer and the nature of the assignee subsequent use.recent decisions recognize that the central enquiry is whether the use of the mark by the assignee is likely to confuse prospective purchasers by departing from the expectations created by the presence of the trademark.the traditional requirement of accompanying transfer of goodwill can thus be understood as requiring that the assignment not disrupt the existing significance of the mark to consumers.
restatement third of unfair competition,cmt.b see also thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed.the courts have upheld such assignments if they find that the assignee is producing a product or performing a service substantially similar to that of the assignor and that the consumers would not be deceived or harmed.marshak,at citations omitted see also sugar busters,at defiance button mach.c c metal prods,cir a trademark may be validly transferred without the simultaneous transfer of any tangible assets,as long as the recipient continues to produce goods of the same quality and nature previously associated with the mark.citation omitted visa,birmingham trust bank,t ransfer of goodwill requires only that the service be sufficiently similar to prevent consumers of the service offered under the mark from being misled from established associations with the mark.quotations omitted.
in this case,vna actions both prior and subsequent to the transfer of the vittoria trademark were calculated to maintain continuity in the use of the mark and the public perceptions of the products associated with it.the record shows that vna took significant steps throughout its use of the trademark to ensure that the mark continued to signify racing tires for bicycles.vna placed advertisements,sponsored professional athletes,attended trade shows,and developed a marketing network consisting of to sales representatives who promoted these tires to approximately bicycle dealers.significantly,eai has never alleged any sort of disruption in the kind or quality of the products associated with the vittoria trademark,and we could find no evidence of any such break upon our independent review of the record.we therefore hold the assignment agreement constitutes a valid transfer of the rights to use the vittoria trademark in the united states.
c.the common control exception 
we next consider whether,in spite of a valid transfer of the trademark from vittoria italy to vna,a regulatory exception to the act removes vna from the scope of its gray market protections.the regulation in question,d,reads,in relevant part 
gray market goods subject to the restrictions of this section shall be detained for days from the date on which the goods are presented for customs examination,to permit the importer to establish that any of the following exceptions are applicable 
the trademark or trade name was applied under the authority of a trade name owner who is the same as the owner,a parent or subsidiary of the owner,or a party otherwise subject to common ownership or control with the owner in an instance covered by d and d of this part.
eai does not allege that vna is the same as vittoria italy,is a parent or subsidiary of vittoria italy,or that it is subject to common ownership with vittoria italy.rather,eai argues that the evidence is sufficien
