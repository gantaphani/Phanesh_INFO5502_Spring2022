chattem chemicals,chattem applied to the drug enforcement administration dea for registration as an importer of narcotic raw materials nrms pursuant to the controlled substances act,et,and the controlled substances import and export act,and collectively referred to as csa.penick penick opposed the application and requested a hearing before the dea,arguing that chattem registration as a nrm importer would increase the danger of nrm diversion to illicit use and thereby undermine the public interest.the deputy administrator of the dea granted the application,concluding that chattem met its burden of proof to show that it is in the public interest to grant its application to be registered as an importer of nrms.chattem.penick petitions for review of the deputy administrator decision and,as detailed below,we deny the petition.
the csa requires that the importation of nrms and the manufacture of their most prominent of which are morphine and tightly controlled in order to prevent their diversion to illicit use.accordingly,the csa prohibits the importation of nrms into the united states unless the importing company is registered by the dea,a,a,and importation is limited to such amounts of nrms as the attorney general finds to be necessary to provide for medical,scientific,or other legitimate purposes,id.a the attorney general register s an applicant to import or export nrms if he determines that such registration is consistent with the public interest and with united states obligations under international treaties,conventions,or protocols.id.a.in determining whether registration is consistent with the public interest,the attorney general must consider the factors enumerated in section a of title,see,which include 
maintenance of effective controls against diversion of particular controlled substances into other than legitimate medical,scientific,research,or industrial channels,by limiting the importation and bulk manufacture of such controlled substances to a number of establishments which can produce an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances under adequately competitive conditions for legitimate purposes 
compliance with applicable state and local law 
promotion of technical advances in the art of manufacturing these substances and the development of new substances 
prior conviction record of applicant under federal and state laws relating to the manufacture,distribution,or dispensing of such substances 
past experience in the manufacture of controlled substances,and the existence in the establishment of effective control against diversion and 
such other factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety.
id.a.pursuant to these provisions,on february,chattem applied to the dea for registration as an importer of nrms and bulk manufacturer of their alkaloids.
on december,the dea approved chattem application for registration as a bulk manufacturer.its concurrent application to import nrms was opposed,however,by penick,noramco of delaware,noramco and mallinckrodt,mallinckrodt,all of which requested a hearing on chattem application under a at the time of chattem application,noramco and mallinckrodt were the only registered importers of nrms,a group that penick joined in because of these potential competitors opposition,then,the administrative law judge alj conducted hearings on chattem application in september and october at which all well as the government called witnesses to testify and introduced documentary evidence relating to the impact on the public interest of chattem registration.chattem.at.the alj ultimately recommended that chattem application be granted.see id.
on february,the deputy administrator heeded that recommendation and decided to grant chattem application to be registered as an importer of nrms.id.at.the deputy administrator,applying a,first determined that chattem registration would not violate any international obligations of the united states because the registration would not likely cause significant increased diversion and thus it was not essential to deny chattem application in order to prevent global diversion of nrms.id.at.the deputy administrator then moved on to consider the public interest factors outlined in a.regarding chattem potential impact on diversion,the deputy administrator recognized that diversion at the retail level has greatly increased in recent years,and is an extremely serious problem,id.at,but nonetheless concluded that chattem ha d met its burden of proof in showing that its registration as an importer of nrms will not significantly interfere with the maintenance of effective controls against diversion,id.at.the deputy administrator noted the unchallenged adequacy of chattem internal security measures to prevent diversion of narcotics to illicit use,the complete lack of documented cases of diversion of nrms imported into the united states,the dea continued regist ration of bulk manufacturers during the pendency of chattem application and the fact that the dea already conducts regular inspections of chattem as a registered bulk manufacturer of alkaloids.id.at.accordingly,the deputy administrator found that the first factor under a supported chattem registration.see id.at.
the deputy administrator further determined that all but one of the remaining public interest factors weighed in favor of registration.she found that t here is no significant evidence that chattem has failed to comply with applicable state and local law or violated state or federal narcotics regulations.id.she also determined that the evidence showed that chattem possesses sufficient technology to process nrms with efficiency because chattem introduced credible evidence that the processing of nrms is not complicated,and that chattem has sufficient facilities to carry out the process,facilities already approved by the dea for bulk manufacture of nrm alkaloids.id.at in light of these considerations,the deputy administrator concluded that chattem met its burden of proof to show that it is in the public interest to grant its application to be registered as an importer of nrms.id.at.penick now petitions for review 
the deputy administrator findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence,viewing the record in its entirety,universal camera nlrb.and although the dea reasoning,as distinguished from its factfinding,may be set aside if the action is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,tourus records,dea,quoting a,that review is narrow and we will uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may reasonably be discerned,bowman,freight,d.at a minimum,however,the arbitrary or capricious standard requires the agency to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.tourus records,at quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass of united states,state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation omitted.our statutory interpretation is governed by the deferential analysis of chevron natural resources defense council,d.see noramco of,dea.
penick raises two primary challenges to the dea approval of chattem registration application the dea misconstrued its obligations under a by ignoring the systemic impact of chattem registration on diversion throughout the chain of distribution,pet r br.at and the dea acted arbitrarily and capriciously by improperly shifting the burden of proof from chattem to the objectors,id.at.we find neither ground meritorious.
section a requires the deputy administrator to consider maintenance of effective controls against diversion of particular controlled substances into other than legitimate medical,scientific,research,or industrial channels in determining whether registration is consistent with the public interest.a.penick argues that,in section a,the congress has directly spoken and requires the applicant to establish the systemic impact of its registration throughout the chain of distribution,including the registration impact on diversion at the retail level pet r br.at.instead,penick claims,the deputy administrator misinterpreted this requirement and rendered the factor superfluous by focusing her diversion discussion solely on chattem internal security measures,a factor properly covered by section a mandate to consider the existence in the establishment of effective control against diversion.id.at citing a.yet this claim fails for a simple reason the deputy administrator plainly considered and rejected the contention that chattem registration would increase diversion.
before the deputy administrator,t he government argued that registering another importer could lead to increase d diversion at the retail level because of the potential of increased importation,increased manufacturing and greater availability of narcotic medication.chattem.at.indeed,the deputy administrator found that the diversion of narcotics at the retail level has greatly increased in recent years,and is an extremely serious problem.id.she nonetheless concluded that chattem registration would not increase diversion because there was little evidence in the record that chattem registration as an importer would have any greater effect on diversion downstream than dea continued registration of bulk manufacturers.id.moreover,the deputy administrator noted the dea ability to control the level of nrm importation and diversion through quotas and inspections,both of which already included chattem in its capacity as a registered bulk manufacturer of controlled substances.id.at noramco,at rejecting,in part,claim that dea misinterpreted csa as not requiring consideration of foreign diversion because the dea in fact considered and rejected the contention that penick registration would increase diversion in india.accordingly,we reject penick challenge to the dea interpretation of section a 
still,an agency action will be overturned if its findings are not supported by substantial evidence,see,or its reasoning is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a.penick asserts that the dea registration of chattem fails both of these standards because the deputy administrator arbitrarily and improperly shift ed the burden of proof from chattem to the objectors.pet r br.at.in light of this alleged shift in the burden of the objectors to establish that chattem registration does not satisfy the public interest standards of a rather than requiring chattem to establish that its registration is in the public claims that the deputy administrator registration of chattem was not supported by substantial public interest evidence supplied by chattem.see id.at.we disagree.
it is true that an applicant for registration as an nrm importer has the burden of proving that the requirements for such registration pursuant to a and d are satisfied,while a ny other person participating in the registration hearing ha s the burden of proving any propositions of fact or law asserted by.c.yet c and a together simply require that the applicant prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its registration is consistent with the public interest as defined by a.indeed,section a enumerated factors represent components of the public interest rather than independent requirements for registration and thus,the deputy administrator may find a given registration consistent with the public interest even if one or possibly more of the public interest factors is not satisfied.see johnson matthey,may,it is well established that the deputy administrator is not required to make findings with respect to each of the section a factors,but has discretion to give each factor the weight he deems appropriate,depending upon the facts and circumstances in each case.air line pilots ass dep t of,although statute requires agency to consider all these factors,the weight to be given to any particular factor lies largely within its discretion because t he act itself does not dictate that the board give priority to any one factor md,dea,unpublished judgment relying on air line pilots to reject claim that dea gave too little weight to section a factor.
here,the deputy administrator recognized that the ultimate burden of proof rested with chattem,see chattem.at,and relied on chattem evidence with respect to each of the enumerated public interest factors.for instance,in deciding that section a weighed in favor of chattem registration,the deputy administrator noted the undisputed evidence that chattem maintains adequate security at its manufacturing plant.id.at.in addition,the deputy administrator concluded that the risk of diversion at the retail level would not be significantly increased by chattem registration in light of chattem evidence that the dea continued to register additional bulk manufacturers of opium alkaloids even though those manufacturers present comparable diversion dangers.see id.at finally,the deputy administrator relied on the existence of dea quotas and inspections to control diversion,see,as well as testimony that there were no documented cases of diversion of nrms imported into the united states,and no significant diversion at the bulk manufacturing level,id.at given all of this evidence,the deputy administrator concluded that chattem met its burden of proof in showing that its registration as an importer of nrms will not significantly interfere with the maintenance of effective controls against diversion.id.at 
the deputy administrator similarly relied on chattem evidence regarding the remaining public interest factors.specifically,chattem vice president provided evidence that chattem has complied with state and local narcotics laws,see id.at section a,and it was undisputed that chattem has never violated state or federal laws relating to narcotic production and distribution,see id.section a.with respect to chattem past experience in the manufacture of controlled substances section a,the deputy administrator recognized that chattem ha d experience in manufacturing controlled substances and noted that chattem introduced credible evidence that the processing of nrms is not complicated,and that chattem has sufficient facilities to carry out the process.id.thus,the deputy administrator affirmatively kept the burden of proving the public interest on chattem and relied on chattem evidence in concluding that each statutory public interest factor supported its registration 
the objectors primarily contended that chattem registration would increase diversion both at the retail,see id.at,and international levels,see id.at.as noted earlier,however,the deputy administrator cited significant evidence of diversion controls in rejecting the claim that chattem registration would increase retail diversion.with respect to international diversion,the deputy administrator correctly noted that we have held that the dea need not consider foreign diversion under section a,see chattem.at citing noramco,at t he congress was concerned with preventing diversion in this country rather than abroad,and concluded,at any rate,that the objectors adduced insufficient evidence that foreign diversion was likely to occur and no evidence of the effect of such diversion on the diversion of narcotics in the united states,id.
given the significant evidence chattem supplied,the deputy administrator decision was neither based on insubstantial evidence nor arbitrary or capricious.we will not disturb the decision of an agency that has examine d the relevant data and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.md,dea,quoting state farm,at.this is all that is required in our limited review of the dea decision.
penick raises an additional challenge to chattem registration which we also reject.the dea may register an importer only if it determines that such registration is consistent with united states obligations under international treaties,conventions,or protocols.a.penick asserts that chattem registration is inconsistent with the united nations single convention on narcotic drugs of single convention,which obligates the united states to take all necessary measures to ensure that the international movement of narcotics is limited to legitimat
