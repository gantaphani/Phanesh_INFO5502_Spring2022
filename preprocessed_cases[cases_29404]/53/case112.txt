this case involves a challenge to the government regulation of canadian cattle imports in the wake of the mad cow disease scare of the late.ranchers cattlemen action legal fund united stockgrowers of america or argues that the united states department of agriculture usda issued an arbitrary and capricious rule relaxing a ban on canadian beef and cattle imports.see bovine spongiform encephalopathy regions and importation of commodities.january,hereinafter the final rule.
argues that recent incidents of mad cow disease in the canadian herd,and in american cows imported from the canadian herd,cast doubt on the agency rulemaking procedure.with additional references to scientific studies and international regulations,challenges the agency assessment that the multiple,interlocking safeguards implemented by both the united states and canada will be effective at preventing human infection domestically.
the district court granted summary judgment to the usda,and we have jurisdiction to review this order under.the facts have been provided in prior related decisions and will not be recited exhaustively here.see ranchers cattlemen action legal fund united stockgrowers of am.united states dep t of,d.hereinafter i,rev cir hereinafter ii.
background 
commonly referred to as mad cow disease,bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse is a degenerative neurological disease that was first discovered in and has since infected more than cattle worldwide,with percent of the cases occurring in england.in the,public health officials discovered that cattle feeding practices were the likely cause of an outbreak of bse in england.at the time,cattle feed typically contained recycled or rendered cattle parts that gave it a higher protein content 
in,the british government discovered that consumption of meat could cause variant disease vcjd in humans.there have been approximately human cases of vcjd,including one case in the united states in a woman who had probably contracted the disease while living in england.scientists are still learning how these diseases develop,incubate and spread.see ii,at.
the food and drug administration and the usda responded to the bse outbreak with new regulations these rules prohibited the use of mammalian proteins in cattle feed,see,and prohibited the use of specified risk materials such as cattle brains,spinal cords,and nerve human food,see.the usda,working closely with the world organization for animal health,developed guidelines and proposed protective measures to prevent the spread of bse to the united states.see.at chief among these measures was a ban on imports of all cattle products from countries where bse was known to exist.see.the usda added canada to this list of countries in may,after a cow in alberta was diagnosed with bse.change in disease status of canada because of bse.may.though canada had instituted its own feed ban in,it was likely that the cow had been exposed before the ban and that the disease had incubated for a period of years the usda estimates that the disease has an incubation period of two to eight years.at.
in august,the agency partially changed course and announced that certain cattle products could be imported from canada,including meat from cows under months of age.see.at.in november,it also announced a proposed rule creating a new category of minimal risk category that would include canada and possibly other countries.see bovine spongiform encephalopathy minimal risk regions and importation of commodities.
shortly before the comment period on this rule was to end,a cow in washington state was diagnosed with bse,likely caused by feed ingested before the canadian feed ban went into effect.the usda reopened the comment period in march with an expiration date of april.see bovine spongiform encephalopathy minimal risk regions and importation of commodities.by the close of the comment period,the agency had received comments.see.at.
on january,after a struggle with over an interim regulation the usda published the final rule,which modified existing regulations to allow imports of canadian cattle under months of age for purchase by feedlots or meat packing companies.see id.at cfr,ii,at.the rule at this stage also allowed in canadian beef products from cattle of all ages.at.
shortly after the rule was published,two older cows in alberta were diagnosed with bse,and the usda attributed the disease to contaminated feed manufactured before the canadian feed ban.the usda then announced its intention to suspend the part of the rule that would relax the ban on meat from cattle over months old.see bovine spongiform encephalopathy regions and importation of commodities partial delay of applicability.march.
the final rule was set to go into effect on march,but was blocked by a preliminary injunction from the district court in i,a ruling stemming from related proceedings in this case.
prior proceedings 
on january,six days after the final rule was published,filed a complaint alleging that the usda rulemaking violated the administrative procedure act apa,the regulatory flexibility act,and the national environmental policy act.it applied for a preliminary injunction,which the district court granted on march.see i,d at.the district court found that had demonstrated a likelihood of success on its claim that the rule was arbitrary and capricious,in violation of the apa.see.while an initial appeal to this court was pending,the parties filed for summary judgment with the district court.
we reversed the preliminary injunction ruling on july,and issued a final amended opinion on august.see ii.we found that the district court had not accorded adequate deference to the usda determinations and concluded that the agency had a firm basis for determining that the resumption of ruminant imports from canada would not significantly increase the risk of bse to the american population.id.at.
in light of this order and opinion,the district court postponed,and ultimately never scheduled,a hearing on the for summary judgment.it denied motion for summary judgment,and granted summary judgment to the usda on april.
the district court order set out the deferential standard of review and provided only one paragraph of analysis.it quoted this court holding in ii,and then stated based upon this,the district court hands are tied.the ninth circuit has instructed this court to abide by this deferential standard,and respect the agency judgment and expertise.it offered no analysis of the record,which had been supplemented several times while the preliminary injunction appeal was pending.
filed its timely appeal of the district court decision on june.only the apa claim is before us.
a second remand is unnecessary 
argues that the district court improperly determined it was bound by our decision reversing the preliminary injunction,and therefore requests that we remand to the district court for analysis of the record that was developed in support of the motion for summary judgment.
correctly points out that the ruling on the motion for a preliminary injunction leaves open the final determination of the merits of the case.smith kline french,cir.this rule acknowledges that decisions on preliminary injunctions are just must often be made hastily and on less than a full record.or.barter fair jackson county,cir citation omitted.
accordingly,the district court should abide by the general rule that our decisions at the preliminary injunction phase do not constitute the law of the case.see see also city of anaheim duncan.any of our conclusions on pure issues of law,however,are binding.see this that and the other gift and tobacco,cobb county,cir charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure a fully considered appellate ruling on an issue of law made on a preliminary injunction appeal become s the law of the case for further proceedings in the trial court on remand and in any subsequent appeal.the district court must apply this law to the facts anew with consideration of the evidence presented in the merits phase.see,at accord washington capitols basketball club,barry,cir.
this administrative law case presents a thornier issue because this court has reviewed the administrative record for the purpose of the injunction,and,with some narrow exceptions,neither we nor the district court may consider any other evidence.see asarco,cir.for summary judgment,has presented only new,evidence,of arguable relevance to this court review.still,technically,the district court was not bound by our earlier conclusions.
though the district court erroneously determined otherwise,remand is not the only option available at this stage of the litigation.our review of a summary judgment order proceeds de novo,see the lands council powell,cir,and in administrative appeals,where the court reviews only the record before the agency,t he factfinding capacity of the district court is typically unnecessary to judicial review of agency decisionmaking.power light lorion,d.simply put,this court task on appeal is the same as the district court task in the initial review both courts are to decide,on the basis of the record the agency provides,whether the action passes muster under the appropriate apa standard of review.id.
because all of new evidence is outside the administrative record and of very limited use,and because we agree with amici that extension of this litigation will aid in its attempt to create,on a rolling basis,a evidentiary record that supersedes usda administrative record,brief of the government of canada at,we decide to reach the merits of this case.
legal standard 
under the apa,an agency action may be set aside only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.we must determine whether the agency considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.city of sausalito,cir citation omitted.this standard of review is highly deferential,presuming the agency action to be valid and affirming the agency action if a reasonable basis exists for its decision.indep.acceptance california,cir citations omitted.
in its paradigmatic statement of this standard,the supreme court explained that an agency violates the apa if it has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mutual auto.ins,d.
the usda rulemaking process 
the animal health protection act authorizes the secretary of agriculture to ban imports of animals if necessary to prevent the introduction of any pest or disease of livestock.we previously remarked that the statutory language indicate s a congressional intent to give the secretary wide discretion in dealing with the importation of plant and animal products.ii,at.the statute does not contain a strict requirement that the usda eliminate all risk that bse will enter the country.id.
the final rule at issue in this case establishes a lower tier of import restrictions for regions that pose a of exporting bse to the united states.though the world organization for animal health would have based any designation on the statistical incidence rate of bse in a given country,the usda disagreed with holding a country to a rigid criterion without consideration of compensatory risk reduction measures,such as surveillance programs.at.the agency instead defined a region as one that had implemented risk mitigation measures including import restrictions,surveillance and a feed ban before bse was detected in the country,conducted an epidemiological investigation after bse was detected,and took additional risk mitigation measures after the bse outbreak.see.the usda did not establish numerical criteria.
the agency accordingly designated canada as a region based on the following documents,actions and considerations 
regulations in the,specifically the bans on the use of specified risk materials in human food from cattle over months old,and the ban on meat from cattle.at.
the revised study of bse risk in the,which concluded that there was a very low risk of bse becoming established domestically if it were introduced.the study found that bans on cattle and feed bans were the most effective measures to prevent bse introduction,and that the biggest risks for human exposure to bse were with the feed bans,use of other infected farm animals in feed,and use of tissues in products for human consumption.id.at.
a memorandum from researchers at the harvard center for risk analysis,which updates the model from the study.id.
measures taken by canada prior to the discovery of bse in,including import restrictions on cattle and canada feed ban.because most infected cattle show clinical signs of bse within seven years of infection,any cattle born before the feed ban would show clinical signs before the time of the final rule and therefore would be detected by surveillance.id.at.
a assessment of bse risk in canada,finding that the cattle imported from europe between and resulted only in a low potential for introduction of bse infection.id.at.
a epidemiological investigation and report after bse detection,which found little exposure to bse and determined that canada protective measures were effective and proposed additional measures.id.
additional measures taken in canada,including a ban on materials from cattle at slaughter,a new epidemiological investigation,and increased surveillance.id.at.
the agency update to its own risk analysis of canada that provides a more detailed analysis of its rules and their application to canada.id.at.
in its later affirmation of the final rule,the usda emphasized that the cumulative effect of all the measures in place in canada and the united states is an extremely effective set of interlocking,overlapping and sequential barriers to the introduction and establishment of bse in the united states.bovine spongiform encephalopathy regions and importation of commodities finding of no significant impact and affirmation of final rule,april.
we endorsed this holistic approach at the preliminary injunction phase,when we chose to evaluate the cumulative effects of the multiple,interlocking safeguards instead of following a divide and conquer strategy.ii,at.because this approach represents a legal conclusion about the construction of the regulations,it is the law of the case,and therefore we adopt it for our decision now.
allegations 
initially brought five claims for declaratory and injunctive relief but appeals only on the basis of its first apa claim,in which it argues that the final rule is arbitrary and capricious because it is based on faulty assumptions about the efficacy of the american and canadian feed and import restrictions.
as we evaluate each argument under this claim,we will consider whether new evidence is relevant to our review.it is an established rule that the focal point for judicial review should be the administrative record already in existence,not some new record made initially in the reviewing court.camp pitts,d.under limited circumstances,however,evidence can be admitted and considered.
at the district court level,evidence is admissible if it fits into one of four narrow exceptions if admission is necessary to determine whether the agency has considered all relevant factors and has explained its decision,if the agency has relied on documents not in the record,when supplementing the record is necessary to explain technical terms or complex subject matter,or when plaintiffs make a showing of agency bad faith.southwest ctr.for biological diversity forest,cir internal punctuation omitted.also relies heavily on one statement in the case law that information might be admitted if it tends to show that the agency relied on assumptions that were entirely fictional or utterly without scientific support.ass of pac.fisheries,cir.
