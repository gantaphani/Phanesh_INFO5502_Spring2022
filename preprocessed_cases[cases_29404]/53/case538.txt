the united states and the united states beet sugar association collectively,appellants appeal the decision of the united states court of international trade in favor of heartland,heartland that declared that the classification of heartland sugar syrup by the united states customs service customs under subheadings of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus was unlawful and that held that the syrup is properly classified under subheading of the htsus.heartland,united states,d.int l trade.because we conclude that customs classification ruling has power to persuade under skidmore swift,we reverse.
background 
under the htsus,the volume of sugar imported into the united states is controlled by a tariff rate quota trq.see additional notes,htsus.sugar entered under the quota is subject to a lower rate of duty than sugar entered above the quota.id.sugar syrups are classified under heading 
other sugars,including chemically pure lactose,maltose,glucose and fructose,in solid form sugar syrups not containing added flavoring or coloring matter artificial honey,whether or not mixed with natural honey caramel 
other,including invert sugar 
derived from sugar cane or sugar beets 
containing soluble solids excluding any foreign substances that may have been added or developed in the product equal to percent or less by weight of the total soluble solids 
described in general note of the tariff schedule and entered pursuant to its provisions 
described in additional note to this chapter and entered pursuant to its provisions 
invert molasses.
htsus.syrups classified under htsus and htsus are subject to the trq,whereas syrups classified under htsus are not.
heartland was established in in taylor,michigan.shortly after being established,heartland sought an advance ruling from customs regarding the classification of a sugar syrup it was considering importing from canada.see providing for requests for tariff classification rulings.heartland described the sugar syrup as consisting of sugar,water,and soluble solids consisting of approximately percent by weight of dissolved solids and approximately percent by weight of water.heartland indicated that the syrup meets the following analysis,by weight,on a dry solid basis 
approximately but not equal to more than of sugar cane beet origin of which unintentionally created reducing sugars invert make up less than 
approximately but not equal to or less than of soluble solids of cane beet origin.
heartland stated that it believed that the syrup should be classified under htsus.heartland explained that the syrup falls under htsus because it is not a syrup of lactose,maple,glucose or fructose and,therefore,does not fall under the prior subheadings of.heartland asserted that the syrup falls under htsus because it contains more than by weight of soluble,solids with no foreign substances,and is not a molasses.
in response to customs request for information on how the syrup is made,heartland described the manufacturing process as follows 
granular raw sugar would be combined with molasses,of cane or beet origin,in the correct proportions to produce a brown sugar of approximately percent polarity.to ensure adequate mixing,the granular raw sugar would be sprayed with the molasses and run through a blending screw.
the percent polarity brown sugar would then be dissolved in hot water within an agitated and heated vessel to produce a simple syrup of approximately by weight dissolved solids.
customs agreed with heartland proposed classification,and issued a ruling letter classifying the syrup under htsus.ruling letter may,new york ruling letter.with this classification,heartland sugar syrup was not subject to the trq.
relying on this ruling,heartland established a business around the manufacture and importation of the sugar syrup.heartland began its refining operations in.in september of,customs investigated heartland operations in response to information from an industry source that heartland might be importing sugar syrup in an attempt to avoid the trq.customs could not substantiate the allegations it therefore closed its investigation in october of without taking any action against heartland.
on january,the united states cane sugar refiners association,the united states beet sugar association,and their member companies collectively,the associations filed a petition under,seeking reclassification of heartland sugar syrup under either htsus or htsus the associations argued that the classification of heartland sugar syrup under htsus defeated the purpose of the solids content provision of htsus.the associations argued that the provision was adopted to ensure that sugar syrups containing less than solids would be subject to the trq because such syrups compete directly with sugar.the associations argued that heartland sugar syrup should be classified under htsus because it is derived from sugar cane or sugar beets and contains less than six percent soluble solids.alternatively,the associations argued that heartland sugar syrup should be classified under htsus,which encompasses certain blended syrups described in additional note to chapter,because it meets the description in additional note of a syrup that contains sugars derived from sugar cane or sugar beets,capable of being further processed or mixed with similar or other ingredients,and not prepared for marketing to the ultimate consumer in the identical form and package in which imported.
on june,customs published notice of its intent to revoke the new york ruling letter and to reclassify heartland sugar syrup under htsus or htsus,depending on whether the quantitative limitations of the trq had been met.proposed revocation of ruling letter treatment relating to tariff classification of certain sugar syrups,cust.bull,at june.in the proposed ruling letter,customs determined that there are no commercial identities or commercial uses for the syrups as imported other than the extraction of the molasses after importation,and the subsequent use of the syrups in the same manner as other syrups classified in provisions of the tariff that are subject to the trq.id.at.customs reasoned that,as a matter of law,it could consider the product uses when determining its proper classification.id.customs stated that it was the intent of the presidential proclamations which established the quotas to include the sugar syrups in question in the trq.id.at.customs determined that heartland sugar syrup would have been subject to a quota under the tariff schedules of the united states tsus,which were in effect prior to the adoption of the htsus,and that conversion to the htsus was not intended to change the applicability of the sugar quotas to products such as heartland sugar syrup,particularly where heartland was subjecting its product to artificial processing to avoid the quota.id.at.customs also determined that the added molasses is a foreign substance relative to the sugar to which it is added and,therefore,should not be included when determining the soluble solids content of the sugar syrup under htsus and htsus.id.at.in support of its determination,customs stated that although molasses is derived from sugar cane or sugar beets,it is derived only as a of the refining process.id.at.customs also noted that molasses is classified under a separate subheading from sugar syrups,htsus.id.
during the comment period,customs received numerous comments from members of domestic and foreign sugar industries in support of the reclassification of heartland sugar syrup.customs also received comments opposing the reclassification.many of the opposing comments were submitted by groups of trade associations,importers and exporters,who opposed customs decision to use c instead of to revoke the new york ruling letter,who opposed customs decision to revoke an interpretative ruling without a compelling reason for doing so,and who opposed customs departure from the rule that importers may fashion their goods to take advantage of favorable duty provisions.heartland also submitted comments opposing the reclassification of its sugar syrup.heartland argued,inter alia,that the new york ruling letter was obtained pursuant to customs established procedures and should be upheld,that the new york ruling letter correctly classified heartland sugar syrup,that the proposed ruling impermissibly focused on the use of the syrup,that the syrup has commercial uses,that neither the tsus nor the purpose of the trq govern the proper classification of the sugar syrup,and that the added molasses is not a foreign substance that should be excluded from the soluble solids content calculation required for classification under htsus or htsus.
on september,customs issued a final notice revoking the new york ruling letter and classifying heartland sugar syrup under htsus,effective november.revocation of ruling letter treatment relating to tariff classification of certain sugar syrups,cust.bull,at,revocation of ruling letter.the revocation ruling addresses two legal issues raised by the comments submitted in response to the proposed revocation customs authority to revoke the prior ruling under and customs authority to consider the commercial identity of imported merchandise when determining its classification.id.at.with regard to the former issue,customs emphasized its mandate to correctly administer the tariff laws of the united states,and its authority to take corrective action when it learns that merchandise is improperly classified.id.at.customs stated that the existence of a petition under did not preclude it from acting under.id.in discussing the latter issue,customs determined that the addition of molasses to raw sugar by heartland is not a genuine step in the manufacturing process,but instead amounts to a disguise or artifice intended to escape a higher rate of duty such as a quota or tariff rate.id.at.customs reasoned that,under such circumstances,it is permitted to inquire into the commercial identity of the imported merchandise.id.
with regard to the foreign nature of the added molasses,customs stated that the step of mix ing molasses with sugar is not a refining process for raw sugar,and the addition of water to such a mixture does not create a sugar syrup derived from a refining process from sugar cane or sugar beet.id.at.customs concluded that molasses,with its impurities,is a foreign substance that must be excluded from the solids content calculation of htsus.id.customs determined that the solids the heartland sugar syrup is less than.id.therefore,customs concluded,the syrup is properly classified under htsus.id.
on september,heartland filed a complaint in the court of international trade challenging the classification of its sugar syrup under htsus and seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent customs from enforcing the revocation ruling.the court exercised its jurisdiction under h,which permits the court to hear challenges to the classification of goods prior to their importation if the party bringing the challenge demonstrates that it will suffer irreparable harm if judicial review is not obtained prior to importation.heartland,d at.pursuant to e,the court reviewed the revocation ruling under the standard of review of the administrative procedure act.id.at.thus,it considered whether customs decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.
the court held that the revocation ruling was not in accordance with law because heartland sugar syrup is properly classified under htsus.id.at.the court determined that the plain language of that subheading encompasses the sugar syrup,as the syrup was described in heartland request for an advance classification ruling.id.the court rejected customs reasoning that the molasses is a foreign substance that should be excluded from the solids content calculation,finding that the record demonstrated that the molasses is made from cane or beet sugar and that the sugar,molasses,and syrup all have the same chemical ingredients,including impurities that naturally occur in sugar.id.at.the court reasoned that because raw sugar itself contains molasses,combining raw sugar with additional molasses does not amount to an addition of a foreign substance.id.at.the court stated that customs conclusion to the contrary was simply wrong.id.the court also stated that customs interpretation of foreign substances to include anything that is itself derived from sugar cane or sugar beets is unreasonable and an abuse of discretion.id.
the court also rejected customs determination that the addition of molasses amounted to an artifice or disguise.id.at.the court noted that heartland never falsified or concealed the identity of its sugar syrup,its method of manufacture,or its use.id.at.the court determined that evidence of record demonstrated a clear commercial purpose for the addition of molasses,citing testimony to the effect that molasses may be added to adjust the purity of the product during crystallization or to produce a final product of a particular polarity.id.at.the court also determined that the evidence of record indicated that heartland sugar syrup results from an intermediate stage of the refining process,citing testimony to the effect that the process of combining granular raw sugar with molasses,adding water,and heating is common in sugar refining operations.id.at.the court noted that the only evidence indicating that adding molasses to sugar is not a legitimate commercial process relates to the addition of molasses to refined sugar,not the addition of molasses to raw sugar,as is done by heartland.id.the court therefore concluded that customs determination that heartland had engaged in an artifice and disguise and its subsequent consideration of the use of the syrup was an abuse of discretion and otherwise not in accordance with law.id.at.
the court therefore granted heartland motion,declared the revocation ruling unlawful,and ordered that the sugar syrup be classified under htsus.id.at.the united states and the united states beet sugar association appeal the court decision.we have jurisdiction over their appeal pursuant to a.
discussion 
in reviewing a decision of the court of international trade,this court usually applies anew the statutory standard of review applied by that court to the agency decision.inland steel indus.united states.pursuant to e,the court applied the apa standard of review to customs classification of heartland sugar syrup,determining whether the revocation ruling was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.heartland,d at quoting a.subsequent to the court decision,however,the supreme court issued united states mead,d,in which it held that customs classification rulings may merit deference under skidmore swift.we therefore will evaluate customs classification of heartland sugar syrup under the standards required by mead and skidmore,as discussed in more detail below.
appellants argue that the court failed to give the revocation ruling the deference required by mead and skidmore.specifically,appellants contend that the court improperly substituted its own judgment for that of customs instead of giving appropriate weight to customs findings.in response,heartland argues that the revocation classification ruling is entitled to minimal deference under mead and skidmore because the reasoning behind the ruling is not persuasive,and because it unjustifiably revoked a prior classification ruling.moreover,heartland asserts that because there is no dispute over the nature of its sugar syrup,the correct classification of the syrup presents a question of law over which the court was entitled to exercise de novo review.
on the merits of the court decision,appellants raise two main arguments.first,they argue that customs finding that heartland improperly engaged in an artifice or disguise designed to avoid the trq was not arbitrary and capricious and,therefore,should not have been disturbed by the court.appellants assert that customs was entitled to consider the commercial identity of heartland sugar syrup,and argue that the record supports customs findings that there is no commercial purpose for adding molasses to sugar and that the sugar syrup has no commercial identity.in response,heartland argues that neither the manufacturing process nor the processing that heartland performs in the united states involves any artifice or disguise.heartland also argues that the cases cited by customs do not support its finding of artifice or disguise,and that its sugar syrup indeed has a commercial use,although that use is irrelevant to the correct classification of the sugar syrup.
appellants other main argument is that the court erred when it determined that the molasses in heartland sugar syrup is not a foreign substance as that term is used in htsus.appellants argue that customs interpretation of the term foreign substances is entitled to deference.appellants assert that the plain language of the htsus provisions,the structure of htsus,and the legislative history of the htsus provisions support customs determination that the term foreign substances refers to substances that are foreign to the syrup at its current stage of manufacture,such as the molasses heartland adds to raw sugar.in response,heartland contends that customs determination that molasses,which is derived from sugar cane or sugar beets,is foreign to a sugar syrup that also is derived from sugar cane or sugar beets is absurd because the molasses and the sugar syrup have common ingredients.heartland also contends that it is the physical constitution of the sugar syrup,not its method of manufacture,that must be the basis of classification under htsus.
appellants also challenge the authority of the court of international trade to determine the correct classification of heartland sugar syrup.appellants argue that because heartland brought this action under h and because the court was required by e to apply the apa standard of review,the court only could vacate and remand customs decision it could not itself classify the sugar syrup.heartland responds to this argument by emphasizing the court duty to determine the proper classification of imported merchandise,and by citing the court authority under c to order the appropriate declaratory relief in any action brought under h.
for the reasons that follow,we determine that customs interpretation of the term foreign substances in htsus as including the molasses which heartland adds to its sugar syrup merits deference under skidmore because of its persuasiveness.we therefore uphold the classification of the syrup under htsus.in view of that holding,we need not address the other arguments raised by the parties on appeal.
the issue before the supreme court in mead was whether a tariff classification ruling by the united states customs service deserves judicial deference.mead,at.at.the court determined that customs classification rulings are best treated like interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines.they are beyond the chevron pale.id.at quoting christensen harris county,d internal citation omitted.the court continued,
to agree that customs ruling letters do not fall within chevron is not to place them outside the pale of any deference whatever.chevron did nothing to eliminate skidmore holding that an agency interpretation may merit some deference whatever its form,given the specialized experience and broader investigations and information available to the agency,and given the value of uniformity in its administrative and judicial understandings of what a national law requires.
id.quoting skidmore,at.internal citations omitted.commenting on the highly detailed nature of the applicable regulatory scheme and customs specialized experience in classifying goods,the court determined that a classification ruling may at least seek respect proportional to its power to persuade.id.at quoting skidmore,at,and citing christensen,at.id.at.stevens,dissenting id.at.breyer,dissenting.the court stated that s uch a ruling may surely claim the merit of its writer thoroughness,logic and expertness,its fit with prior interpretations,and any other sources of weight.id.at.
although the classification ruling before the court in mead was not issued pursuant to c and,therefore,was not subject to a public notice and comment procedure,we read the court holding as applying to all customs classification rulings.see id.at the statutory changes requiring a comment period when customs modifies or revokes a prior classification ruling reveal no new congressional objective of treating classification decisions generally as rulemaking with force of law,nor do they suggest any intent to create a chevron patchwork of classification rulings,some with force of law,some without.in sum,classification rulings are beyond the chevron pale.we therefore will review the classification of heartland sugar syrup in accordance with mead and skidmore.
mead indicates that the following factors are to be evaluated when determining the degree of deference to accord a customs classification ruling its writer thoroughness,logic and expertness,its fit with prior interpretations,and any other sources of weight.mead,at.at.those factors echo the factors set forth in skidmore for determining the weight to accord an administrative ruling,interpretation,or opinion the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade.skidmore,at.applying these factors to the classification of heartland sugar syrup,we determine that the revocation ruling is entitled to deference because of its persuasiveness.
the revocation ruling was issued pursuant to a notice and comment process,during which numerous members of the sugar industry,including the united states beet sugar association and heartland,submitted comments in support of and in opposition to the ruling.customs responded to the two main legal issues raised by the comments when it issued the ruling.revocation of ruling letter,cust.bull.at.we therefore conclude that customs gave thorough consideration to the ruling.
the revocation ruling is supported by a logical and explanation published in the customs bulletin.id.at.specifically,on the issue of whether the term foreign substances encompasses the molasses heartland adds to raw sugar to make its sugar syrup,customs explained 
the addition of the molasses to the sugar is a foreign substance sic containing impurities in producing the sugar syrup and,therefore,we exclude the molasses with impurities in calculating the rule 
there is a view that since the molasses is naturally found in sugar cane or sugar beets,it meets the requirements of subheadings htsus,in that it molasses is derived also from sugar cane or sugar beets.as stated above,molasses is derived as a from the refining of sugar cane or sugar beets and it is not derived as sugar from the refining of sugar cane or sugar beets.thus,molasses syrups are classified in heading,htsus,and not in heading,htsus.
we also note that customs has specialized experience in classifying goods,mead,at.at,which lends further persuasiveness to its ruling.
the only factor that weighs against giving deference to the revocation ruling is the ruling lack of consistency with an earlier pronouncement,the new york ruling letter.the revocation ruling,of course,changed the classification of heartland sugar syrup.however,because c permits customs to revoke a prior classification of goods,inconsistency with a prior ruling is not itself a basis for denying all deference to a revocation ruling.moreover,the new york ruling letter was not issued pursuant to a notice and comment process and did not address the specific issue addressed in the revocation the molasses heartland adds to raw sugar is a foreign substance within the meaning of htsus.
under these circumstances,we conclude that the revocation ruling has power to persuade.mead,at.at skidmore,at.
as discussed above,the relevant provision of the htsus does not indicate to what a substance must be foreign in order to be a foreign substance excluded from the solids content calculation of htsus.customs therefore had to interpret the term foreign substances in order to classify heartland sugar syrup.customs determined that the term refers to substances that are foreign to the sugar syrup at the rel
