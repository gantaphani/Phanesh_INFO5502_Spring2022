the united states the government appeals from the final decision of the united states court of international trade granting summary judgment in favor of intercontinental marble icm,thereby reversing the classification by the united states bureau of customs and border protection customs of certain merchandise imported by icm.intercont l marble united states,d.int l trade.because we agree that customs has not identified any support for its changed interpretation of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus,we affirm the court of international trade order.
background 
icm is an importer of stone products,including varieties known as crema marfil,negro marquina,rojo alicante,emperador marron,and botticino.id.at.there are no issues of disputed fact on appeal,as the parties agree that the merchandise is stone slab under the definition set forth in additional note to chapter of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states is not geological marble,but is instead limestone and is capable of taking a polish.id.both parties further agree that the term marble is not defined in either the htsus or its legislative history.id.at.the single issue to be resolved on appeal is whether customs properly classified icm imports under the htsus subheading for other calcareous stone,or if,as icm contends,customs should have classified those items under the subheading for marble.
the htsus provides the following subheadings for stone products 
chapter,htsus based on its informed compliance publication,customs classified icm merchandise under subheading other calcareous stone.see what every member of the trade community should know about classification of marble.in this publication,customs explains 
numerous rulings issued by customs headquarters have held that geological definitions of stone must be followed under the harmonized tariff schedule htsus.although polished limestone or limestone capable of taking a polish is often called marble in the trade,headquarters has ruled that it is classifiable as other calcareous stone in subheading,htsus,not as marble in subheading.since geological definitions govern the classification of stone under the htsus and these two stones are regarded as distinct geological entities,limestone may not be classified as marble.
classification of marble,supra,at.one of the numerous rulings referenced by the publication explains that under the former tariff schedule,the tariff schedule of the united states tsus,
all stones that polish,whether or not such stone met the technical definition of marble,were classified by customs as marble.however,under the htsus,whose basic provisions are common to the tariffs of all of the nations using the harmonized commodity description and coding system,it is imperative that the united states,whenever possible,define the various tariff terms in a manner consistent with all nations utilizing the htsus.it is for this reason that we have settled upon the geological definition of various stones to determine the proper classification under the htsus.
headquarters ruling letter june,available at custom hq lexis hereinafter,hrl see also intercont l marble,d at collecting additional rulings.as stone capable of taking a polish,icm imports would have been classified as marble under the tsus.see intercont l marble,d at hrl.
the court of international trade rejected customs classification of icm merchandise.consistent with the concession made by customs in its publication and rulings,the court concluded that the commercial meaning of marble was broader than its geological definition and that,consequently,it was beyond debate that the commercial meaning of the term include d the subject merchandise.intercont l marble,d at citing classification of marble,supra,at.reviewing the plain language of the htsus,the explanatory notes,and the change in structure of the schedule between the tsus and the htsus,however,the court of international trade found no indication that congress intended to change the meaning of the term marble under the htsus.id.at see also id.at.the court additionally explained that in the absence of an expressed legislative intent,customs publication,classification of marble,was not entitled to any deference.finding no authority for customs narrowing definition,the court of international trade determined that marble retained its commercial meaning under the htsus.accordingly,the court granted icm summary judgment motion and denied the government.the government timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the grant of summary judgment by the court of international trade de novo.boen hardwood flooring,united states.summary judgment is appropriate where,as here,there is no issue of material fact regarding the imported merchandise and the disposition of the matter depends entirely on the interpretation of the relevant tariff provision,which we also determine de novo.id.despite our de novo review of interpretations of tariff provisions,classification decisions by customs interpreting provisions of the htsus may receive some deference under the principles of skidmore swift.see rocknel fastener,united states,citing united states mead,d.
where a tariff term is not defined in either the htsus or its legislative history,the term is given its common meaning,which is presumed to be the same as its commercial meaning.rocknel fastener,at carl zeiss,united states.to ascertain the common meaning of a term,a court may consult dictionaries,scientific authorities,and other reliable information sources and lexicographic and other materials.rocknel fastener,at quoting tower sons united states,ccpa.furthermore,in the absence of a clear congressional intent to change the statutory meaning of a tariff term,a court may rely on the meaning of that term under the tsus as a guide to resolving uncertainties under the htsus.anhydrides chems.united states.house of representatives conference report similarly explains that 
in light of the significant number and nature of changes in nomenclature from the tsus to the hts us,decisions by the customs service and the courts interpreting nomenclature under the tsus are not deemed dispositive in interpreting the hts us.nevertheless,on a basis prior decisions should be considered instructive in interpreting the hts us,particularly where the nomenclature previously interpreted in those decisions remains unchanged and no dissimilar interpretation is required by the text of the hts us.

the government opens its brief with a variety of dictionary sources providing definitions of marble,and asserts that the common meaning of the term reflected by those definitions supports a geological definition of the term.as the court of international trade noted,however,while the dictionary definitions cited by the government do demonstrate that marble has a geological definition,those very same sources also acknowledge a broader meaning.see the random house dictionary of the english language defining marble as limestone in a more or less crystalline state,and capable of taking a high polish emphasis added cited in br.for appellant at oxford english dictionary ed defining marble as l imestone in a crystalline or,less strictly,also a granular state and capable of taking a polish emphasis added electronic version cited in br.for appellant at.icm submits additional definitions supporting the court of international trade conclusion as well as its own position.see paul thrush,dep t of the interior,a dictionary of mining,mineral and related terms a true marble is a limestone which has been crystallized by heat or pressure and is capable of taking a polish.commercially,any limestone that is sufficiently hard and coherent to take a good polish is called a marble.mcgraw hill encyclopedia of the geological sciences ed defining marble as a term applied commercially to any limestone or dolomite taking polish.as the foregoing authorities make clear,the common meaning of as reflected in the government own broader than the geological definition that customs wishes to assign to the term.
the broader definition is also consist
