by complaint to the international trade commission under section of the tariff act of as amended,amgen,charged that certain importations of recombinant human erythropoietin and derivatives thereof collectively epo are in violation of section.amgen charged that the imported epo and the process by which it is produced in europe are covered by one or more claims of the following amgen united states patents patent claims and patent claims,and patent claims patent claims and patent claim and patent claim.the intervenors roche holding,roche,roche diagnostics gmbh,and roche,collectively roche are producers and importers of the accused epo.
roche moved for summary determination of noninfringement as to all claims,on the ground that the imported epo is exempt from infringement by operation of e,the safe harbor statute,because the imported epo is used only for the statutorily exempt purpose of the development and submission of information under a federal law regulating the manufacture,sale,and use of drugs.the commission granted the motion for noninfringement,holding that all of roche activities are within the safe harbor,including the foreign production of the imported product.amgen appeals this ruling,on the principal ground that the safe harbor statute does not apply to tariff act violations based on foreign practice of patented processes,and also on the ground that not all of the imported epo was used for the statute exempt purposes.
we affirm the commission ruling that the safe harbor provided by e applies in proceedings under the tariff act relating to process patents as well as product patents,for imported product that is used for exempt purposes.in part ii,we reverse the commission ruling that roche was entitled to summary determination,because there was a genuine dispute of material fact concerning whether all of roche activities fell within this safe harbor.accordingly,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.

the issues on this appeal center on the safe harbor statute for drug products,on application to the imported epo of the following provisions of title 
e it shall not be an act of infringement to make,use,offer to sell,or sell within the united states or import into the united states a patented invention solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a federal law which regulates the manufacture,use,or sale of drugs or veterinary biological products.
e in any action for patent infringement brought under this section,no injunctive or other relief may be granted which would prohibit the making,using,offering to sell,or selling within the united states or importing into the united states of a patented invention under paragraph.
the commission held that the safe harbor statute applies to products produced offshore by a process patented in the united states.amgen argues that this statute does not bar the exclusion of such importation,reasoning that the e reference to importing a patented invention is necessarily limited to importation of product,for a process can not be imported.amgen states that it is incorrect to assume that congress,by silence,changed the section right and obligation of the commission to reach importation based on offshore practice of a united states patented process.amgen argues that the enactment of g,whereby the patent act provided remedy in the district courts for offshore practice of a patented process but explicitly applied the safe harbor to g,shows congressional intent to limit the safe harbor to process patents that would be enforced under g 
g whoever without authority imports into the united states or offers to sell,sells,or uses within the united states a product which is made by a process patented in the united states shall be liable as an infringer,if the importation,offer to sell,sale,or use of the product occurs during the term of such process patent a product which is made by a patented process will,for purposes of this title,not be considered to be so made after 
it is materially changed by subsequent processes or 
it becomes a trivial and nonessential component of another product.
amgen states that the enactment of g makes clear that the commission authority under section was not changed by enactment of g,because in adding g to title when congress enacted the process patent amendments of,congress stated that t he amendments made by this subtitle shall not deprive a patent owner of any remedies available under subsections a through f of section of title,united states code,under section of the tariff act of,or under any other provision of law,c.that is,congress preserved both the safe harbor,e,and the tariff act section,in enacting g.amgen states that this means that process patent infringement would give way to the safe harbor when enforced in the district courts under g,while remedy is retained for process patent infringement enforced under section.amgen stresses that section was enacted several decades before g was added to the patent act,and that the legislative record is clear that the tariff act remedy was intended to continue undiminished.
the commission rejected these arguments,and held that the safe harbor statute fully applies to process patent liability under the tariff act.in support the commission cited glaxo novopharm,and general genentech.novopharm related to determinations of infringement based on the filing of an anda for product produced offshore and this court remarked that the artificial acts of infringement that are created by e concerning the conditions under which the patentee can sue for infringement during the pendency of the only to a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent but not to the process for making the drug.however,the issues in that case did not relate to exclusion under the tariff act,but to the right to sue when the charged infringements arose under sections e and g.in general this court held that the safe harbor statute applied in the district court as to product produced offshore after g was enacted the district court did not rule on the safe harbor for process patents under the tariff act,although the court apparently assumed that the safe harbor would apply on the same terms.at explaining that although the itc dismissed the patentee section complaint with prejudice for violation of discovery orders,this ruling can not have claim preclusive effect on the case at bar involving the same transactional facts because the itc does not have the power to award damages for patent infringement which was the form of relief sought by the patentee.
in kinik international trade commission,this court explained that g provided a new right and remedy in the district court,but held that the tariff act remedy of exclusion based on practice of a patented process was unchanged,and that the exceptions set forth in g and,shown supra,did not apply in section cases.id.at.amgen argues that kinik confirmed that no change whatsoever was made in the commission authority under the tariff act to exclude products made offshore by an infringing process,and that this was not changed by the enactment of either g or e.amgen also argues that congress intentionally included only product patents when enacting e,for the reference therein to importation and patented invention tracks the language of a,which does not concern processes practiced abroad.thus amgen argues that an importation that is exempt under e of the patent act may nonetheless be unlawful under section of the tariff act.
the commission did not accept amgen distinction,and ruled that the safe harbor statute insulates the roche epo from section exclusion not only as to infringement of amgen product patents but also as to amgen process patents.we conclude that the commission ruling is in consonance with congressional policy as set forth in enactment of g,and as elaborated by the supreme court in its applications of the safe harbor statute.
in enacting g the legislative history included the policy statement that 
specifically,the committee does not intend that it shall be an act of infringement to import a product which is made by a process patented in the united states solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a federal law which regulates the manufacture,use,or sale of drugs.see e of title,united states code.congress previously decided that certain actions do not constitute patent infringements and this act does not change that prior policy decision.
implementing in other contexts this broadly stated congressional policy,in merck kgaa integra lifesciences i,d the court explained that congress intended that the immunity of regulatory activity not be inhibited,stating that e exemption from infringement extends to all uses of patented inventions that are reasonably related to the development and submission of any information under the fdca.id.at.emphasis in original.and in eli lilly medtronic,d the court held that e includes medical devices,although the statute mentions only drugs and veterinary products the court stated that t he phrase patented invention in e is defined to include all inventions,not inventions alone.id.at.in both merck and eli lilly the court stressed the congressional purpose of removing barriers to proceeding with federal regulatory approval of medical products.this purpose and its application in precedent weigh heavily against selectively withholding the e exemption depending on whether the infringement action is in the district court or the international trade commission.we thus affirm the commission ruling that the safe harbor statute applies to process patents in actions under section,when the imported product is used for the exempt purposes of e.
amgen argues that even on the commission interpretation of the safe harbor statute,at least some of the imported roche epo is not exempt because its actual use was not reasonably related to the development and submission of information under the fdca,e.amgen points out that while e is directed to the development of information for submission to the fda,amgen did not bring this action for exclusion of imports until after roche had completed its submission to the fda.amgen states that roche had entered the biologics license application stage,which is the stage at which complete data have been obtained,analyzed,and presented to the fda.see a requiring that the bla contain data derived from nonclinical laboratory and clinical studies which demonstrate that the manufactured product meets prescribed requirements of safety,purity and potency.
amgen states that by the time this action was brought roche had shifted its attention in the united states to infringement analysis experiments,trials,and activity.amgen states that these activities are not shielded by the safe harbor,for they do not contribute,relatively directly,to the generation of the kinds of information that are likely to be relevant to the processes by which the fda would decide whether to approve the product in question,a general definition of exempt activity endorsed by the court in merck as consistent with,if less detailed than,the construction of e that we adopt today.at.amgen argues that roche activities are not exempt from infringement of either product or process patents.
the commission appears to have assumed that all otherwise infringing activities are exempt if conducted during the period before regulatory approval is granted.that assumption is incorrect,for the court in merck confirmed that e ach of the accused activities must be evaluated separately to determine whether the exemption applies.id.at.the studies at issue in merck were presented as scientific studies,and it is apparent that commercial and marketing studies are more clearly subject to separate evaluation for application of the exemption.
the alj denied most of amgen requests for discovery of roche activities,with the exception of the experiments conducted by,and perhaps some briefs dispute what was disclosed in discovery.however,as to work,amgen asserts that these experiments were conducted for marketing purposes,with the objective of trying to distinguish roche epo from that of amgen.the evidence on this aspect was conflicting and required closer analysis than it received,in light of the distinctions drawn by the court in merck.for example,an email from roche program director for oncology asked to explore the metabolism uptake in the bone marrow liver uptake and to see if there are differences between cera and epo,a communication that amgen states is directed to future marketing plans to distinguish the roche and amgen products,whereas the roche position was that it contacted because roche was currently studying cera and epo in terms of receptor interaction by using an cellular model system only and would need to move into a more physiological situation.the amgen position is that since this study was conducted after the bla information had been submitted to the fda,by definition this study was not directed to obtaining information for submission for federal approval of the roche product,as required for exemption under e.
the alj held that all of the imported epo,including that used after the application for federal approval was completed,is exempt.however,the court in merck set careful boundaries to the exemption,requiring separate review of all studies for which the exemption was claimed.roche does not appear to dispute that some imported product was used to conduct roche marketing department recommended studies for purposes of brand recognition and not for fda approval,and the record does not discuss whether any of the work was supplemental to the bla and intended for submission to the fda,thereby subject to exemption.see entitled changes to an approved application and requiring an applicant to inform the fda about each change in the product,production process,quality controls,equipment,facilities,responsible personnel,or labeling established in the approved license application s.
to the extent that the commission held all importation and all uses exempt while fda approval was pending,the safe harbor statute does not so provide.the factual questions of the purposes of the and other challenged activities were improperly summarily decided adversely to amgen.on remand the commission shall consider the exempt status of each study for which question has reasonably been raised.
on appeal,the parties dispute whether,under,the commission has jurisdiction to address imminent importations in the absence of a contract for sale.the commission argues that it has juris
