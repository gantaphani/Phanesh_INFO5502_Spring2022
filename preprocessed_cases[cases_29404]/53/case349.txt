the presiding administrative law judge alj conducted an investigation into infringement and validity of the asserted claims.as relevant here,the alj concluded that each of the power dekor products under investigation did not infringe claims and of the patent or claims and of the patent and that claims and of the patent were invalid under for lack of written description support in the originally filed disclosure and that each of the power dekor products under investigation infringed one or more of claims,and of the patent.in re certain laminated floor panels,inv.int l trade comm july,alj determination.the commission reversed with respect to the first two issues,concluding that unilin had proven that power dekor products infringed claims and of the patent and claims and of the patent and that claims and of the patent satisfied the written description requirement and were therefore not invalid.in re certain laminated floor panels,inv.int l trade comm,commission opinion.based on these conclusions and the alj finding that each of the power dekor products infringed one or more of claims,and of the patent,which was not reviewed,the commission determined that there was a violation of section and issued a general exclusion order under d.because the commission conclusions are supported by substantial evidence,we affirm.
background 
each of the patents at issue descends from patent application serial the application,which was filed on june,and ultimately issued as patent the patent.the patent issued on december,from a continuation of the application.the and patents issued on april,and august,respectively,from continuations of the application that resulted in the patent.
the patents are directed at a mechanism for coupling adjacent panels of laminate flooring without requiring permanent,without the use of adhesives nails.the patents teach that the coupling mechanism is substantially in the form of an interlocking tongue and groove.see patent abstract patent abstract patent abstract.figure,included in all three patents,illustrates an embodiment of the patented coupling mechanism.
an important feature of the invention is the extent to which the coupling mechanism counteracts the formation of gaps between adjacent floor panels,patent.to that end,the patents provide for a compression force component that draws adjacent floor panels toward each other,id.in one embodiment,a portion of the lower lip of the groove is inclined at angle a.in the inclined portion,the lower lip of the groove contacts the tongue along a common plane of tangency l.the tongue is shaped such that,upon insertion into the groove,the lower lip of the groove is displaced a small distance v from its original position,id.further,the lower lip is described as having an elastically yieldable or bendable portion,whereby the lower lip tends to return to its original position when displaced,id.thus,when the tongue and the groove are coupled together,the lower lip of the tongue exerts a force against the groove along the common plane of tangency l.the horizontal component of this force comprises the compression force component that draws adjacent floor panels toward each other,counteracting the formation of gaps.
another important aspect of the claimed in the patent in the inclusion of voids,or clearances,the open spaces marked in figure in certain locations between the tongue and groove of adjacent floor panels.according to the patent,the voids ensure proper engagement between the tongue and the,by providing a space for stray dust or debris to collect during insertion of the tongue into the groove,patent.
on july,unilin filed a complaint with the commission under section,alleging that thirty respondents imported and sold laminated floor panels that infringed various claims of the patent,the patent,and the patent.the commission initiated its investigation on july.see in re certain laminated floor panels.int l trade comm,notice of investigation.unilin later moved to terminate the investigation with respect to the patent,commission opinion at,and added two respondents as well as claims of infringement with respect to the patent,see in re certain laminated floor panels.int l trade comm.unilin also subsequently limited its assertions of infringement to claims,and of the patent,claims and of the patent,and claims and of the patent.commission opinion at.
the alj conducted an evidentiary hearing on april and april,and subsequently issued an exhaustive final initial and recommended determination on july.alj determination.as relevant here,the alj determined that numerous products of the respondents,including all seven power dekor products under investigation,infringed one or more of claims,and of the patent.id.at.these claims are collectively termed the snap action claims because they require a snap action effect upon coupling,which the alj construed as a physical action that takes place when an elastically bendable portion of one panel bends during coupling to allow the joint to come together and after coupling the bendable portion returns towards its original position when the locking elements are engaged.id.at.
in addition,the alj construed the limitation of claims and of the patent and claims and of the patent collectively the lower lip claims requiring an elastically bendable portion of the lower lip.the alj determined that claim of the patent and claim of the patent require elastic bending anywhere on the lower lip of the floor panel.id.at.the alj determined that claim of the patent and claim of the patent,however,require elastic bending limited to a specific location of the lower lip between the deepest point of the groove and the lowermost bottom area of the recess,approximately between the areas labeled and in figure.id.at.with respect to these latter two claims,the alj determined that bending can not be shown in any area outside of the claimed location.id.
under this construction of the elastically bendable portion limitation,the alj determined that power dekor products did not infringe the lower lip claims.specifically,the alj concluded that unilin had not met its burden of proving infringement because the tests performed by unilin expert,loferski,were unreliable.id.at.alternatively,even if loferski tests were deemed reliable,the alj stated that those tests would nevertheless be insufficient to prove infringement of claim of the patent and claim of the patent.id.at.that was because loferski simply measured the relative distance that the distal or tip end of the lower lip of each accused product was displaced during,he recorded the measurement denoted with a v in figure.id.at.according to the alj,however,displacement at the distal end of the lower lip did not prove that the lower lip bent in the specific area required by claim of the patent and claim of the patent.id.in so concluding,the alj rejected unilin theory that the lower lip of the accused products could be analyzed as a cantilever beam,which necessarily bends throughout its entire length.id.
also relevant here,the alj concluded that claims and of the patent the clearance claims were invalid because they failed the written description requirement of.id.at.specifically,the alj determined that there was no written description support for the concept of clearances in the disclosure the application.the alj focused on certain amendments that were made to the specification,wherein the applicant used the term clearance to describe various areas of the floor panels that had been previously referred to by three separate terms recess,space or intermediate space,and chamber or dust chamber.id.at.according to the alj,nothing in the specification indicated that these three different spaces could be treated the same.id.at.the alj determined that this clearance concept constituted new matter,as did the applicant of certain figures to show clearance locations that were not previously identified.id.at.because the clearance claims were not supported by the written description,the alj concluded that they were invalid under.id.at.
after receiving petitions for review from unilin,several respondents,and the investigative attorney ia,the commission determined to review several of the alj conclusions,including the construction of claim of the patent and claim of the patent,infringement of claims and of the patent and claims and of the patent,and invalidity of the asserted claims of the patent.see in re certain laminated floor panels,int l trade comm,notice of commission determination to review portions of a final initial determination.the alj findings with respect to infringement of the snap action claims were not reviewed by the commission,and thus,those findings became part of the commission final determination.see h.
the commission concluded that the alj erred in construing claim of the patent and claim of the patent to require the absence of bending outside of the specified area of the lower,between the deepest point of the groove and the lowermost bottom area of the recess of the lower lip approximately between the areas labeled and in figure.commission opinion at.according to the commission,bending in the lower lip must occur in the elastically bendable portion but that bending is not prohibited elsewhere in the lower lip.id.
the commission also reversed the alj determination that power dekor products did not infringe the lower lip claims.the commission addressed at length the alj concerns regarding loferski test methodology,ultimately concluding that the tests he performed were reliable.id.at.the commission stated in sum,we find the evidence demonstrates that loferski test was a reasonable method for testing the presence of a bent lower lip,and while his test may not have been perfect,neither power dekor nor the alj identified any significant sources of error in the test.id.at.the commission also rejected the alj independent ground of with respect to claim of the patent and claim of the patent.in particular,the commission receiving supplemental briefing on the it was appropriate to analyze the lower lip of the accused products according to cantilever beam principles.id.at.thus,the commission concluded that unilin had proven that the lower lip of each accused product bent elastically throughout its length,including in the specific area required by claim of the patent and claim of the patent.id.at.
next,the commission reversed the alj determination that the clearance claims were invalid for lack of written description.the commission agreed with unilin and the ia that the applicant merely introduced the term clearance as a generic term that encompassed areas that the described as spaces,chambers,and recesses in the coupling joints of the panels.id.at.the commission relied on schering amgen,for the proposition that the use of a new term by the patentee to describe what was already disclosed does not constitute new matter,id.at.according to the commission,the applicant amendment to the application resulting in the patent did not introduce new matter because it did no more than label specific clearances and explain what was already shown in the specification and figures of the original application.commission opinion at.thus,the commission concluded that the disclosure demonstrated that the applicant was in full possession of the subject matter of the clearance claims at the time that original disclosure was filed.the commission determined that the clearance claims were not invalid under,finding that the respondents had not proven invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.id.
finally,after reaching the foregoing conclusions regarding infringement and validity,the commission considered the appropriateness of entering a general exclusion opposed to a limited exclusion order directed only at the particular respondents products under investigation.id.at see d.the commission agree d with the alj recommendation of a general exclusion order based on the alj findings of a widespread pattern of unauthorized use of the patented invention and the business conditions prongs of the test for whether a general exclusion order is warranted.commission opinion at.accordingly,the commission entered a general exclusion order with respect to claims,and of the patent,claims and of the patent,and claims and of the patent.
discussion 
on appeal,power dekor challenges the commission determinations with respect to infringement of the lower lip claims and validity of the clearance claims.power dekor argues that substantial evidence supports neither the commission conclusion that power dekor products infringed the lower lip claims nor its conclusion that the clearance claims were adequately described in the disclosure.power dekor does not appeal the determination that all seven of its products under investigation infringed one or more of the snap action claims.we will address the merits of power dekor appeal.first,however,we address a threshold question.
prior to oral argument,we sent a letter to the parties requesting that they prepare responses to a question that had not been sufficiently addressed in their respective briefs whether the issues raised by power dekor on appeal to this court were moot.specifically,we asked w hether this case is moot because the accused products at issue in this appeal all infringe at least one of claims,and of patent,and the general exclusion order is supported by the infringement of those claims.simply stated,a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.powell mccormack,d.where the controversy between the parties has ended,the case becomes moot and will be dismissed,h owever convenient it might be to have decided the question for future cases.united states alaska.
at oral argument,unilin contended that the appeal is moot because the commission determined that all seven of power dekor products infringed one or more of claims,and of the patent the snap action claims,and power dekor did not appeal that determination.in other words,unilin argued that even if we agree with power dekor on the merits and reverse the commission with respect to infringement of the lower lip claims and validity of the clearance claims,power dekor products would still be excluded from the country based on the unappealed finding by the commission that those products all infringed one or more of the snap action claims.
power dekor and the commission argued that the appeal is not moot.that is because,according to power dekor,the controversy on appeal is not whether the seven power dekor products that were subject to investigation will be excluded from importation.rather,power dekor contends that the controversy on appeal relates to the scope of the commission general exclusion order geo,which affects the type of products that power dekor will be permitted to import in the future.according to power dekor,it would like to import products that,under the commission rulings,do not infringe the snap action claims claims,and of the patent but do infringe the lower lip claims claims and of the patent and claims and of the patent and the clearance claims claims and of the patent.see oral arg.at,available at.gov oralarguments mp.mp.as examples of such products,power dekor points specifically to the products of two other respondents that are not parties to this appeal the lock product of vohringer wood product shanghai and the engagement product of yekalon industry.according to power dekor,it desires to import such products in the future but,under the general exclusion order in its current form,it is prohibited from doing so.the commission agreed with power dekor that the appeal is not moot because there is a live controversy about the scope of its general exclusion order.
when the commission determines that there has been a violation of section,it may issue one of two types of exclusion orders a limited exclusion order or a general exclusion order.see fuji photo film,int l trade comm n.both orders direct customs and border protection customs to bar infringing products from entering the country.a limited exclusion order is limited in that it only applies to the specific parties before the commission in the investigation.id.in contrast,a general exclusion order bars the importation of infringing products by everyone,regardless of whether they were respondents in the commission investigation.id.a general exclusion order may only be issued if necessary to prevent circumvention of a limited exclusion order,or there is a pattern of violation of this section and it is difficult to identify the source of infringing products.d see id.
paragraph of the general exclusion order issued by the commission provides,in relevant part 
accordingly,the commission hereby orders that l aminated floor panels covered by one or more of claims,and of the patent,claims and of the patent,and claims and of the patent are excluded from entry into the united states for the remaining term of the listed patents,except under license of the patent owner or as provided by law.
the commission order is typical of general exclusion orders,speaking in terms of patent claims rather than parties infringing products.it directs customs to exclude from entry any laminated floor panels that infringe one or more of claims,and of the patent,claims and of the patent,and claims and of the patent.as the commission recognized,however,it would be difficult for customs to independently test each floor panel presented for importation to determine whether it was covered by the geo.thus,at the recommendation of the alj and the ia,the commission included a certification provision in the geo.the certification provision reads as follows 
pursuant to procedures to be specified by customs,as customs deems necessary,persons seeking to import laminated floor panels that are potentially subject to this order shall certify that they are familiar with the terms of this order,that they have made appropriate inquiry,and thereupon state that,to the best of their knowledge and belief,the products being imported are not excluded from entry under paragraph of this order.at its discretion,customs may require persons who have provided the certification described in this paragraph to furnish such records or analyses as are necessary to substantiate the certification.
first,we hold that power dekor challenge to the validity of claims and of the clearance not moot.the,and patents all issued from continuations of the original application.because the and patents were granted no term extension,they both expire on june,years from the date the application was filed.see a.the term of the patent,however,was extended by days pursuant to b.thus,the patent will expire days after june.as noted above,the commission determined that all seven power dekor products under investigation infringed at least one of claims,and of the finding that power dekor has not appealed.however,the commission also determined that all seven of those products infringed at least one of claims and of the patent.therefore,under the general exclusion order,power dekor is currently prohibited from importing any of those seven products until the patent expires days after june.a successful challenge to the validity of claims and of the patent would enable power dekor to begin importation days earlier,promptly upon expiration of the patent on june.for at least that reason,the portion of power dekor appeal concerning validity of the clearance claims is not moot.
for the following reasons,however,we hold that the portion of power dekor appeal regarding infringement of claims and of the patent and claims and of the lower lip moot.as an initial matter,it is clear that the live controversy on appeal can not be the exclusion of the seven power dekor products under investigation from entry into the united states.that exclusion is fully supported by the commission determination that each of the seven products infringes at least one of claims,and of the snap action was not appealed.in other words,any injury caused by the exclusion of those seven products would not be redressed by our determination,if appropriate,that the products do not infringe claims and of the patent and claims and of the patent.
power dekor concedes that the exclusion of its seven products from importation is not redressable by this court.instead,it argues that the controversy on appeal relates to the scope of the commission general exclusion,the inclusion of claims and of the patent and claims and of the patent in the geo.the only injury to which power dekor points as resulting from the commission inclusion of the lower lip claims in the geo is that it is prevented from importing products that do not infringe the snap action claims but that do infringe one or more of the lower lip claims.of course,the fact that power dekor has no legal right to import products that infringe one or more of the lower lip claims is true regardless of whether those claims are listed in any general exclusion order.see a b.until the and patents expire,power dekor is not permitted to import products that actually infringe one or more of the lower lip claims,unless those claims are otherwise held invalid or unenforceable.the true nature of the injury that power dekor asserts lies in the potential collateral estoppel effect of the with the commission conclusions regarding infringement of the products under a determination,in future proceedings,of whether there is infringement by similar products that power dekor presents for importation.
power dekor essentially argues that it will be precluded from importing products similar to vohringer lock product and yekalon engagement product because the commission general exclusion order instructs customs to exclude from entry any product that infringes one or more of the lower lip claims and the commission held that the lock and engagement products infringe one or more of those claims.power dekor contends that,if it is not permitted to seek resolution of the infringement issue in the present appeal,it will forever be barred from importing such products.stated differently,the injury articulated by power dekor is that it will be collaterally estopped by the commission present rulings from arguing in future proceedings,whether before customs or the commission,that products similar to the lock and engagement products do not infringe the lower lip claims.we do not agree,however,that power dekor is injured by collateral estoppel.
the factual findings of infringement that were adverse to the other parties vohringer and yekalon in this investigation will not bind power dekor in future proceedings.see comair rotron,nippon densan,noting that,in order for collateral estoppel to apply,the party against whom estoppel is sought must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action.the commission factual findings that the lock and engagement products infringe the lower lip claims are only preclusive as to vohringer and yekalon,respectively.
in addition,we do not think that,under the circumstances,the commission determinations of infringement with respect to the seven power dekor products under investigation should have preclusive effect against other products presented by power dekor for importation at a future,if power dekor attempts to design around the unappealed infringement by those seven products of the snap action claims.first,we note that proof of infringement by collateral estoppel is only appropriate in limited circumstances,where it is shown that a close identity exists between the relevant features of the accused device and the device previously determined to be infringing.see acumed llc stryker,noting that claim preclusion does not apply with respect to infringement unless the accused device and the device previously held infringing are essentially the same,meaning that the differences between them are merely colorable or unrelated to the limitations in the claim of the patent citations omitted see also del mar avionics,quinton instrument,holding that claim preclusion did not apply because a device not previously before the court,and shown to differ from those structures previously litigated,requires a determination on its own facts young engineers,int l trade comm n,refusing to find noninfringement by way of collateral estoppel,where the accused infringer made no attempt to establish that the device in question was the same as the device previously held noninfringing.
here,infringement of the unappealed snap action claims appears related,in part,to infringement of the lower lip claims.for example,the alj interpreted the snap action claims as requiring a physical action that takes place when an elastically bendable portion of one panel bends during coupling to allow the joint to come together and after coupling the bendable portion returns towards its original position when the locking elements are engaged.alj determination at emphases added.in other words,it is the elastically bendable property of the lower lip of the accused products that contributes to the claimed snap action coupling effect.power dekor apparently proposes to avoid infringement of the snap action claims by altering the structure of its future products,such that those products are coupled by rotational the lock and engagement than assembly via the snap action that occurs when two panels are laterally shifted toward each other there has been no showing that collateral estoppel will apply to power dekor future products in view of these structural,that power dekor future products will be essentially the same as those previously determined by the commission to infringe the lower lip claims.
finally,the prospect of collateral estoppel seems especially diminished where,as here,proof of infringement requires more than a passing observation of the accused device structure.claims and of the patent and claims and of the patent require that the lower lip of an accused floor panel have an elastically bendable portion,the proof of which presumably requires significant expert testing.indeed,all of power dekor arguments here with respect to infringement center on the propriety of loferski method of testing the lower lip of each of its products for an elastically bendable portion.
in sum,we conclude that the commission findings with respect to infringement of the lower lip claims can give power dekor no reasonable concern about preclusive effect,dep t of.there is simply no reason why power dekor,at a future date,will be positioned differently any other foreign company when presenting laminate floor panels for importation.panels that infringe one or more of the claims included in the geo will be excluded those that do not infringe will be allowed entry into the united states.the commission findings of infringement with respect to the lower lip claims in this investigation will have no preclusive effect on power dekor in future import proceedings therefore,we conclude that power dekor has failed to allege an actual injury caused by the inclusion of those claims in the geo,and we decline to address power dekor arguments relating to infringement.
finally,we address power dekor contentions that the clearance claims are invalid for lack of adequate written description in the disclosure.the first paragraph of section of the patent act provides,in pertinent part 
the specification shall contain a written description of the invention,and of the manner and process of making and using it,in such full,clear,concise,and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains,or with which it is most nearly connected,to make and use the same 
we have interpreted that section as requiring a written description of an invention separate from enablement.enzo biochem,citing mahurkar.
in order to satisfy the written description requirement,the disclosure as originally filed does not have to provide in haec verba support for the claimed subject matter at issue.purdue pharma faulding,citing fujikawa wattanasin.nonetheless,the disclosure of the prior application must convey with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that,as of the filing date sought,the inventor was in possession of the invention.poweroasis,usa,quoting mahurkar,see also id.that inquiry is a factual one and must be assessed on a basis.purdue pharma,at.
we review the commission factual findings under the substantial evidence standard.c e.thus,we review for substantial evidence the commission determination that claims and of the patent satisfy the written description requirement of.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.enercon gmbh int l trade comm n,quoting consol.edison labor relations.it is more than a mere scintilla,consol.edison,at,but something less than the weight of the evidence,consolo fed.maritime comm n,d.importantly,the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency finding from being supported by substantial evidence.id.at.citation omitted.
power dekor argues on appeal that the commission decision regarding validity is not supported by substantial evidence.according to power dekor,the disclosure of the original application does not convey with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that the inventor possessed the,the concept of claimed in claims and of the patent.power dekor contends that the concept of clearances was not discussed in the original specification rather,it was introduced as new matter in the application leading to the patent through alterations to fourteen paragraphs,the introduction of new reference numbers in certain figures,and the addition of two completely new paragraphs.
power dekor contends that the commission was incorrect in concluding that the patentee merely introduced the word clearances as a generic term that encompasses the recesses,the chambers,and the spaces that were disclosed in the original disclosure.power dekor argues that those three terms were used in the original disclosure to describe three different types of spaces,and that nothing in the original disclosure indicates to one of ordinary skill that recesses,chambers,and spaces can be treated the same.indeed,power dekor notes,the original disclosure provides that chambers and spaces are internal voids that are formed when two panels are coupled together,whereas it only describes certain areas of uncoupled panels as recesses.according to power dekor,this inconsistency is manifested in the conflicting ways that the term clearance is used in the claims of the patent,wherein clearance is used in claim to refer to the internal void between to adjacent panels but in claim to refer to an edge that defines the internal void upon coupling of two adjacent panels.
finally,power dekor argues that claims and of the patent do not simply require the general presence of one or more clearances.rather,they require a specific combination of clearances in specific locations between adjacent floor panels.according to power dekor,the original disclosure does not describe the importance of including clearances in the specific combinations claimed in claims and of the patent.in support of this argument,power dekor cites our decision in purdue pharma.the claims at issue there were directed at a method of treating pain by orally administering a dosage of an opioid analgesic on a basis,wherein the maximum plasma concentration cmax achieved was more than twice the plasma level of the opioid at approximately hours after administration.purdue pharma,at.we acknowledged that certain examples in the original specification provide d date from which one can piece together the ratio.id.at.however,we determined that the ratio was not supported by the original specification because neither the text accompanying the examples,nor the data,nor anything else in the specification in any way emphasizes the ratio,and thus,we concluded that one of ordinary skill in the art would not be directed to the ratio as an aspect of the invention.id.power dekor argues that,as in purdue pharma,
