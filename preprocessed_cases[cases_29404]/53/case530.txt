we affirm the decision of the court of international trade sustaining commerce determination of constructed export price.we do so because we conclude that,under e,commerce had discretion as to whether to apply the special rule,and rhp does not,in the alternative,challenge commerce calculation as otherwise unreasonable or unsupported by substantial evidence.however,we vacate the court decision sustaining commerce calculation of the profit component of constructed value and remand the case for further proceedings.that result is mandated by our recent decision in skf usa united states.there,we vacated the decision of the court of international trade and remanded the case with the instruction that commerce i explain its methodology for calculation of constructed value profit identical to commerce constructed value profit calculation challenged in this appeal,and ii explain why that methodology comported with statutory requirements.we thus,and remand.
background 
the antidumping law provides that if commerce determines that imported merchandise is being sold in the united states at less than its fair value and the practice is causing material injury to a domestic industry,there shall be imposed upon such merchandise an antidumping duty.the antidumping duty is in an amount equal to the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price for the merchandise.normal value generally is the price at which the subject merchandise is sold in the exporting country.see.export price generally is the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold in the united states.see.
determining constructed export price.
when a foreign producer or exporter sells a product to an affiliated purchaser in the united states,the antidumping law provides for the use of a constructed export price as the export price for purposes of computing the dumping margin the difference between normal value and export price.micron,united states.constructed export price is the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold or agreed to be sold in the united states to a purchaser not affiliated with the producer or exporter,as adjusted under subsections c and d of.b.
under section c,the price used to establish constructed export price is subject to specified increases and reductions.further adjustments to constructed export price are set forth in section d.pursuant to d,the price used to establish constructed export price shall also be reduced by the cost of any further manufacture or assembly including additional material and labor,except in circumstances described in subsection e of this section.
subsection e of section sets forth a further method of calculating constructed export price when value is added to merchandise after importation 
e special rule for merchandise with value added after importation.
where the subject merchandise is imported by a person affiliated with the exporter or producer,and the value added in the united states by the affiliated person is likely to exceed substantially the value of the subject merchandise,the administering authority shall determine the constructed export price for such merchandise by using one of the following prices if there is a sufficient quantity of sales to provide a reasonable basis for comparison and the administering authority determines that the use of such sales is appropriate 
the price of identical subject merchandise sold by the exporter or producer to an unaffiliated person.
the price of other subject merchandise sold by the exporter or producer to an unaffiliated person.
if there is not a sufficient quantity of sales to provide a reasonable basis for comparison under paragraph or,or the administering authority determines that neither of the prices described in such paragraphs is appropriate,then the constructed export price may be determined on any other reasonable basis.
e.while they both address the situation in which value is added to merchandise after importation,sections d and e represent quite different approaches to calculating constructed export price.section d provides for the price used to calculate constructed export price being reduced by the cost of further processing.section e,on the other hand,provides for calculating constructed export price without reference to the price at which the further manufactured goods are sold to an unaffiliated purchaser.
determining normal value.
as noted above,the antidumping duty for particular merchandise is the amount by which the merchandise normal value exceeds its export price or,when applicable,its constructed export price.typically,normal value is calculated within a reasonable time of the sale providing a basis for the export price.see a a.normal value is the price at which the foreign like product is first sold for consumption in the exporting country,in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade.a b i.however,in circumstances where an insufficient quantity of sales has occurred in the exporting country,or the market in the exporting country does not otherwise provide a comparable price,commerce may look to third country sales of the subject merchandise to determine normal value.see a c and a b ii.the antidumping law provides that,in such circumstances,commerce may utilize the price at which the foreign like product is so sold or offered for sale for consumption in a country other than the exporting country or the united states.a b ii.
in the alternative,section a provides that where normal value can not be determined under section a b i,then,notwithstanding section a b ii,the normal value of the subject merchandise may be the constructed value of that merchandise.constructed value is calculated according to e,which provides in pertinent part as follows 
e constructed value.
for purposes of this subtitle,the constructed value of imported merchandise shall be an amount equal to the sum of 
the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind employed in producing the merchandise 
a the actual amounts incurred and realized by the specific exporter or producer being examined in the investigation or review for selling,general,and administrative expenses,and for profits,in connection with the production and sale of a foreign like product,in the ordinary course of trade,for consumption in the foreign country,or 
b if actual data are not available with respect to the amounts described in subparagraph a,then 
i the actual amounts incurred and realized by the specific exporter or producer being examined in the investigation or review for selling,general,and administrative expenses,and for profits,in connection with the production and sale,for consumption in the foreign country,of merchandise that is in the same general category of products as the subject merchandise,
ii the weighted average of the actual amounts incurred and realized as described in part i by exporters or producers that are subject to the investigation or review other than the exporter or producer described in clause i for selling,general,and administrative expenses and for profits,in connection with the production and sale of a foreign like product,in the ordinary course of trade,for consumption in the foreign country,or 
iii the amounts incurred and realized for selling,general,and administrative expenses,and for profits,based on any other reasonable method and 
the cost of all containers and coverings of whatever nature,and all other expenses incidental to placing the subject merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the united states 
as can be seen,constructed value is not the actual price at which subject merchandise is offered for sale in the exporting country.rather,it is a proxy for a sales price,based on an amalgamation of component costs.see skf,at.the statute provides four separate methods for calculating the general administrative costs and profit components of the constructed sum.a e.actual data from the exporter manufacture and sale of foreign like products in the exporting country is preferred.see e a and b.only if such data is unavailable,as where there are no sales of foreign like products,or only sales,is commerce to utilize one of the remaining three methods,set forth in section e b.skf,at.we turn now to the facts of this case.
this case concerns the eighth administrative review of the antidumping duty order on antifriction bearings other than tapered roller bearings and parts thereof,covering the period may,through april.rhp bearings,d at.
rhp bearings and nsk bearings manufacture and sell bearings in the united kingdom,some of which are sold to a united states affiliate,nsk corporation.during the period covered by the review,both made sales to their affiliate.as part of the administrative review,commerce sent a questionnaire requesting information concerning the quantity of sales of the subject bearings,the home market,any relevant markets,the market,costs of production,and constructed value this information was sought so that commerce could calculate normal value.
included in the questionnaire was a section,entitled further manufacture or assembly in the united states.the section was directed to subject merchandise exported to the united states and changed in value or physical condition further manufacture prior to delivery to the first unaffiliated customer in the united states.the section requested that,for the period of review,the respondent provide the net price charged to the affiliated importer for each product included in the review that was further manufactured,as well as the net price charged to unaffiliated customers for each further manufactured final product.rhp bearings,d at.this information was sought to enable commerce to determine whether the value added by further manufacture substantially exceeded the value of the subject merchandise that had been further processed.commerce explained if you do not believe that the in the united states exceeds substantially the value of the subject merchandise that has been further processed,you need not provide this information.see id.did not submit this data.see id.
the questionnaire also contained a section e,entitled cost of further manufacture or assembly performed in the united states.this section requested information necessary for calculating constructed export price in the situation where it was not believed that the value added by further manufacture exceeded substantially the initial import value.responding to section e,provided information relating to further manufacturing in the united states this included information relating to raw materials,labor,electricity,and equipment.see id.at.furnished in addition an analysis of the costs of the above inputs,as well as a fairly thorough description of its accounting practices and financial methods.see id.at.commerce used the data provided by in its questionnaire to calculate the constructed export price of the bearings sold during the period of review.see id.at.
commerce published the preliminary results of the administrative review on february.see.in the preliminary results,commerce stated that,except in the cases of and one other manufacturer,it had employed the special rule for further manufactured goods in calculating constructed export price,see e.at.according to commerce,this approach was consistent with commerce intention to apply the special rule in all cases where the value added is likely to exceed substantially the value of the subject merchandise.id.the information supplied by firms responding to section of the questionnaire was used to determine whether this criterion was met.commerce determined that the threshold for use of the special rule would be crossed when value added during further manufacturing in the united states contributed to a minimum of of the price charged to the first unaffiliated customer for the manufactured product.id.in the case of,commerce calculated the constructed export price pursuant to d by deducting costs of further manufacturing described in response to section e of the questionnaire.id.commerce did not calculate the relative value of further manufacturing.however,argues,and commerce does not dispute,that the value of such further manufacturing exceeded commerce threshold.
with respect to the normal value calculation,see,commerce determined,based upon responses to its questionnaire,that and several other exporting firms could not base normal value on home market sales in the manner contemplated by a b i.commerce explained that a substantial portion of home market sales for and the several other manufacturers had been determined to be below the cost of production and that,therefore,pricing data from home market sales would not be used in determining normal value.preliminary results.at.in arriving at this determination,commerce relied upon data for all identical bearings,and bearings within the same family id.having determined that normal value could not be calculated under section a b i,commerce turned to the constructed value methodology of e.in arriving at the profit component to be used in the constructed value calculation,commerce utilized e a,which looks to profits in connection with the production and sale of a foreign like product.final results.at.however,in that regard,commerce did not employ the same definition of foreign like product that it had used in the calculations that it had initially made under a b i identical bearings and bearings within the same family.rather,it referenced all bearing models within the subject merchandise that were reported in the sales databases as potential matches to sales.id.in other words,commerce aggregated data for all foreign like products for all bearing families under review.see rhp bearings,d at.
in response to commerce preliminary results,along with other interested parties,provided comments.in its comments,argued that,in its case,commerce had erred in not using the special rule of e in computing constructed export price.final results at.suggested that the value added by further processing to its exported bearings exceeded commerce threshold and that the statute therefore required that commerce use the special rule.id.commerce rejected this argument in the final results,stating that the decision to apply the special rule was discretionary.according to commerce 
the special rule for further manufacturing exists in order to reduce the department administrative burden section e of the act provides that the department need only apply the special rule where it determines that the use of such alternative calculation methodologies is appropriate.we retain the authority to refrain from applying the special rule in those situations where the value added,while large,is simple to calculate.
final results at.
regarding commerce calculation of the profit component of constructed value for purposes of arriving at a normal value for the bearings under review,several interested exporters responded by criticizing commerce use of aggregated data from all families of bearings.specifically,it was argued that giving foreign like product two different meanings when applying the provisions for determining normal value was improper and contrary to the definition of the term foreign like product in.final results at in response,commerce stated that 
an aggregate calculation that encompasses all foreign like products under consideration for normal value represents a reasonable interpretation of e a.moreover,we believe that,in applying the preferred method for computing cv profit under e a,the use of aggregate data results in a reasonable and practical measure of profit that we can apply consistently in each case.
pursuant to c,challenged commerce final results determinations before the court of international trade.the torrington company intervened as a defendant in the litigation.
upon the administrative record,the court of international trade,upheld commerce determinations in the final results.rhp bearings,d.the court agreed with the government that,under e,commerce had discretion in deciding whether to apply the special rule.id.at.in doing so,it relied on the language of section e which states that the special rule may be used if the administering authority determines that the use of such sales is appropriate.id.the court concluded that commerce had properly determined that the rule is inappropriate in those situations where the value added,while large,is simple to calculate.id.at quoting final results at.
the court of international trade also upheld commerce use of all foreign like products under consideration for purposes of calculating the profit component of constructed value in determining normal value.rhp bearings,d at.the court relied upon a prior court of international trade decision,rhp bearings united states,d.int l trade.in that case,the court held that an identical method of calculating constructed value profit,which used aggregate data of all foreign like products under consideration in order to determine normal value under e a,was consistent with the antidumping statute.rhp bearings,d at.
has timely appealed the court of international trade determination on these two issues.we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to a.
discussion 
when reviewing determinations made by commerce,this court applies anew the standard of review applied by the court of international trade in its review of the administrative record.de cecco di filippo fara martino united states.we uphold commerce determination unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i.
on appeal,renews its challenge to commerce determination of constructed export price and normal value.specifically,takes issue with commerce determination to adjust the price used to arrive at constructed export price by reducing that price by the cost of further manufacture or assembly,as contemplated by d.according to,commerce should have followed the approach of the special rule set forth in e.as seen above,that section provides that,in specified circumstances,constructed export price is to be constructed from analogous sales of subject merchandise.contends that the specified circumstances existed in this case.as far as normal value is concerned,challenges commerce determination to calculate the profit component of constructed value under d a using aggregate data from reported home market sales of bearings.
contentions implicate two issues of statutory interpretation.the first is whether section e,the special rule for merchandise with value added after importation,particularly mandates its use to calculate constructed export price in circumstances where the value added by additional manufacture substantially exceeds that of the subject merchandise.the second issue of statutory interpretation concerns commerce treatment of the term foreign like product as used in section e a to calculate constructed value profit.
we review questions of statutory interpretation without deference.steel group united states.in reviewing an agency construction of the statute that it administers,we address two questions as required by the supreme court decision in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.the first question is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if so,we and the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,however,congress has not spoken directly on the issue,we address the second question of whether the agency responsible for filling a gap in the statute has rendered an interpretation that is based on a permissible construction of the statute.see also micron,united states.
a.the special rule issue.
argues that a reading of d and e compels the conclusion that commerce must apply the special rule whenever the value added in the united states by the affiliated person is likely to exceed substantially the value of the subject merchandise.e.in making this argument,points to section d,which states that the price used to establish constructed export price shall be reduced by the cost of any further manufacture or assembly including additional material and labor,except in circumstances described in subsection e of this section.emphasis added.according to,the word except is an unambiguous expression of the intent of congress that section d is not to apply in the circumstances described in subsection e.also argues that a reading of section e makes clear that application of the special rule is mandatory once it has been determined that the value of the imported product is substantially outweighed by the value added by further manufacturing in the united states.bases this on the inclusion of the word shall in the statute 
where the subject merchandise is imported by a person affiliated with the exporter or producer,and the value added in the united states by the affiliated person is likely to exceed substantially the value of the subject merchandise,the administering authority shall determine the constructed export price for such merchandise by using one of the following prices 
e emphasis added.
the government and torrington respond that the statute confers broad discretion upon commerce to determine whether to apply the special rule.both parties argue that ignores the parts of the statute quoted below.they contend that these provisions support the proposition that commerce has discretion in selecting a methodology for the calculation of constructed export price 
t he administering authority shall determine the constructed export price for such merchandise by using one of the following prices if there is a sufficient quantity of sales to provide a reasonable basis for comparison and the administering authority determines that the use of such sales is appropriate 
the price of identical subject merchandise sold by the exporter or producer to an unaffiliated person.
the price of other subject merchandise sold by the exporter or producer to an unaffiliated person.
if there is not a sufficient quantity of sales to provide a reasonable basis for comparison under paragraph or,or the administering authority determines that neither of the prices described in such paragraphs is appropriate,then the constructed export price may be determined on any other reasonable basis.
e emphasis added.according to the government and torrington it is clear from the statutory language that application of the special rule is not mandatory,and is clearly subject to the discretion of commerce.
the parties contentions squarely frame the issue before us.the first part of e states the circumstances in which the special rule comes into play w here the subject merchandise is imported by a person affiliated with the exporter or producer,and the value added in the united states by the affiliated person is likely to exceed substantially the value of the subject merchandise.neither commerce nor torrington alleges that such circumstances do not exist here.therefore,the question we must answer is whether,when the triggering c
