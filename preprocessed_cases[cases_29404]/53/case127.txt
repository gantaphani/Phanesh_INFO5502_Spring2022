this case,which arises from a trademark dispute over the use of the term,was precipitated by the customs service detention of imported safes bearing that mark.stuhlbarg international sales,known as sisco,brought a suit for declaratory judgment and cancellation of the trademark owned by john brush.the district court granted sisco request for a preliminary injunction.it restrained brush from interfering with sisco importation of safes,and ordered brush to consent to the customs service release of the detained products.on appeal,brush challenges the district court jurisdiction,arguing that exclusive jurisdiction rests with the court of international trade and that the claims are barred by the doctrines of exhaustion and ripeness.brush also contests the preliminary injunction.we conclude that the district court had jurisdiction,was not barred from hearing the claim,and did not abuse its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction.
background 
brush and sisco are competitors in the home and small business strongbox market.each company produces safes designed to protect the contents from fire.since about,brush has manufactured and sold security storage boxes.brush claims to have used the mark for more than years,although its trademark application indicates only that the mark was used at least as early as.brush is the owner of two federally registered trademarks 
trademark registration,granted in,for all purpose lockable containers for storing valuables and 
trademark registration,granted in,for fire resistant containers in the nature of safes,security chests,and filing cabinets.
sisco is of somewhat more recent vintage.morton stuhlbarg,sisco founder and president,is a former brush employee.after leaving brush in the late,he formed the saga international,and thereafter started sisco sisco manufactures safes which have recently been sold under the brinks home security label as the protector firesafe.
for more than ten years,the parties have,in one form or another,been engaged in a trademark dispute over the term.since at least,sisco has used the term firesafe with brush knowledge over the years,brush has engaged in a series of escalating responses.first,judging that sisco sales were insignificant,brush made a calculated judgment to rely on the marketplace.next,in brush objected in writing to sisco use of the term firesafe.sisco responded by denying infringement,stating that the mark was descriptive and generic,and making clear that it would continue to use it.brush did not sue sisco or take further action at that time.
when the market picked up in the late,brush decided to take more definite action.in,it unsuccessfully attempted to enforce a stipulation between brush and saga against sisco.see supra note.the relationship soured still further in when,according to brush,sisco began targeting brush major customers.from may through october,sisco secured significant orders for its products from large retailers who had been buying from brush,including staples,target,and kmart.this signaled a substantial increase in potential sales and market share,and prompted brush to take the action that precipitated this lawsuit in june,brush recorded its trademark with the customs service.thus,on october,customs detained nine containers holding approximately sisco safes.the safes were destined for one of sisco new customers,kmart,and were due at kmart distribution centers in late october.customs did not provide sisco with notice of seizure or exclusion.sisco did not file a protest with customs or a complaint in the court of international trade.
instead,five days after detention,sisco filed suit in federal district court,seeking a declaratory judgment of and cancellation of brush trademarks.upon sisco motion,the court issued a temporary restraining order a contempt order and a preliminary injunction in which it enjoined brush from hindering sisco importation of safes bearing the designations firesafe,or fire resistant safe and ordered brush to provide customs with written consent to sisco importation of safe products.brush appeals these orders.
discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
brush contends that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over this case,and that the court of international trade has exclusive jurisdiction to hear a challenge to the detention of sisco goods.the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law reviewed de novo.see garvey roberts,cir.
this case lies at the intersection of two contexts trademark protection and customs regulation.for although this case involves goods detained by customs,at bottom it is a suit seeking cancellation of federally registered trademarks and a declaration of.sisco beef is with brush assertion of its claimed trademark rights.the complication arises here because those two and governed by different jurisdictional provisions.
in general,federal district courts have original jurisdiction over actions based on federal statutes relating to trademarks,see k mart cartier,d both the general provision and the specific provision regarding actions relating to would,standing alone,vest the district courts with jurisdiction over this action.this grant of jurisdiction is limited,however,by statutes conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the court of international trade,or cit.id.the cit exclusive jurisdiction is well defined in four sections of the federal code,that deal primarily with civil customs and trade actions by and against the united states.unless an action falls within the cit exclusive carve out jurisdiction,then jurisdiction is proper in the district court.
this dichotomy between district court and cit jurisdiction creates a distinction between parties who challenge a seizure of goods who may sue in district court and parties who challenge a denial of a protest of exclusion of goods who may challenge the denial only in the cit.the difference was summarized by the cit in fabrics,united states,the practical effect of exclusion is to deny entry into the customs territory of the united states.the importer may then dispose of the goods as he chooses.in the case of seizure,however,the government often takes control of the merchandise,and may ultimately institute forfeiture proceedings.
here,brush argues that jurisdiction is properly in the cit under a,which governs civil actions against the united states to contest denial of a protest under the tariff act of.this argument has not sued the united states to appeal denial of a protest,but rather has sued brush to challenge the trademark.
although sisco was notified that its goods were detained,customs did not provide notice indicating that the goods were seized or excluded.sisco goods were in limbo.indeed,it appears that sisco goods were not,as excluded goods are,available for disposal outside the united states,were not free to be diverted elsewhere,and could not be dispose d of as sisco chooses.at.in this case,it is not at all clear that the goods were either seized or excluded.but the record does indicate that there was never a notice of exclusion,or a protest of exclusion,or a denial of a protest.thus,just as in k mart cartier,this suit involves no protest,much less a denial of one,at.
on the other hand,characterizing this as a trademark alternately,as a seizure action,and not a denial of an exclusion consistent with the district court jurisdiction over substantive trademark disputes.the cit jurisdiction statutes do not divest a federal district court of jurisdiction over the underlying trademark dispute sisco complaint does not charge the customs service with improper application of its regulations rather,it is a declaratory judgment suit under the lanham act that concerns substantive trademark issues.the district court original trademark jurisdiction is not destroyed simply because sisco sought the release of detained goods as a partial remedy.as the district court noted,the distinction is not dispositive where the underlying dispute involves substantive trademark issues.
the cit itself has consistently held that substantive trademark disputes are properly brought in district court,even where there is denial of a protest of a n
