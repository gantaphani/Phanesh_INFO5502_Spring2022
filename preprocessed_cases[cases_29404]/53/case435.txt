united states the government appeals from a decision of the court of international trade granting judgment in favor of corporation.united states,wl.int l trade.because we find that the court of international trade correctly construed the tariff schedules of the united states tsus and correctly determined that the imported goods qualified for duty free treatment under the generalized system of preferences gsp,we affirm the decision of the court of international trade.
background 
a.the administrative protest 
in,opened a tile factory in mexico to produce tiles from the raw materials of talc and clay that are exported from the united states into mexico.in mexico,the talc and clay are ground with wollastonite and scrap tile from mexico,mixed,and pressed to form tiles,which are finished with a glaze made partially from the imported clay but mostly with frit,silica,and zinc from mexico.
in,and,imported wall tiles from mexico into the united states.at.entered the tiles as ceramic articles under item of the tsus,which applies to ceramic tiles floor and wall tiles mosaic tiles other and defines ceramic article as hardened by such heat treatment that the body if reheated to pyrometric cone would not become more dense,harder,or less porous,but does not include any glass article.headnote a,part,schedule,tsus headnote a.under headnote a,a duty rate of applies.pyrometric cone is the state of energy required to deform a cone of a particular composition and size,and it may be achieved through different time and temperature combinations.at.
in,filed an administrative protest contesting the classification and assessment in liquidating these entries by the united states customs and border protection customs id.at.claimed that the tiles should have been classified under item a,tsus as mineral substances,and articles of mineral substances not specifically provided for other not decorated which entitles the tiles to treatment under the gsp.
b.the court of international trade proceedings 
on march,the court of international trade held that t he articles are to be classified under item,tsus.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court considered the government various arguments that proposed construction of headnote a led to absurd results,testing methodology was improper under headnote a,test results showed only de minimis changes that should be ignored,and the articles did not qualify for treatment under the gsp.
the court of international trade construed the statutory language and concluded that headnote a clearly excludes any articles that become more dense,harder,or less porous when reheated to pyrometric cone.id.at.in other words,classification is to be based on testing which produces empirical results.the meaning of headnote a is plain and unambiguous it bases classification on the effect of reheating subject articles to pyrometric cone.id.at.the court of international trade found that the statutory language was clearly and deliberately inserted,the application of the plain meaning is not absurd,and the government fails to propose a workable alternative.id.at.in doing so,it rejected the government argument that such an exclusion would lead to the absurd result that only a few of the wall tiles would meet the statutory test as mere speculation since t here was no testimony to the effect that the test would result in exclusion of all ceramic wall tile from such classification.id.
second,the court considered the government argument that testing methodology was improper.protests for,and entries resulted in reliance upon tests of samples produced from and later by customs new orleans laboratory,since tiles for most of the challenged shipments were no longer available.id.at.however,the court found that the use of later samples was proper since the tiles remained unchanged.id.at the characteristics of fired wall tile have not changed over time.in support of this finding,it noted that 
the raw materials for wall tiles have come from the same mines,the manufacturing process has remained essentially unchanged,ceramica regiomontana plant in monterrey,mexico has used the same or more modern versions of the basic equipment,mills,pressing equipment,dryers,except for one of the tunnel kilns which has not been updated since it was first put into use in,and the formula has been employed since to create consistent end product.
the court first examined the testing method used by customs.the new orleans laboratory method used by customs involved taking one tile,cutting it into at least five pieces,subjecting the pieces to the boil and soak specified in,testing for absorption,and then reheating those pieces to pyrometric cone.id.at.notably,the court cited the testimony of a quality control manager and former senior analyst at the new orleans laboratory testifying for the government,who stated that she was not aware of a rationale for taking one tile and cutting it into five samples.id.the court then found that the results by the customs testing method were incoherent because they showed that the absorption of the samples either increased,decreased,or stayed the same,depending upon interpretation.id.further,it noted that t he customs laboratory did not use any control samples.id.
the court of international trade then considered the testing method employed by.it noted that first conduct ed physical experimentation to determine the appropriate cycles to achieve cone,then test ed at the extremes the slowest and fastest rates the kiln could achieve cone,at the rate customs selected,and at intermediate temperature equivalents that achieve cone.id.at.instead of breaking the tiles into five pieces as customs did,f or each temperature equivalent,broke tiles into halves.id.the court of international trade found that a s a population,when compared against the samples which were not reheated,the wall tile samples became less absorbent after reheating to cone.id.it found that o nly method employed a control sample.id.at.
applying the factors established in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,the court of international trade thus rejected the government argument that testing methodology was improper,finding instead that precision in using a large sample population and using control samples against which to check the results confirm ed the reliability of method.id.at see also libas,united states.after it examined the four factors enunciated in daubert to determine reliability,it held that c onsideration of the daubert principles thus supports finding in favor of methodology over customs methodology.at.
third,the court of international trade rejected the government claim that the changes in the tiles that resulted from testing were de minimis and should be ignored,finding instead that headnote a does not exclude de minimis changes.id.at.it further found that,regardless,the changes in the tiles shown by test methodology were not de minimis.id.at.it found that the changes observed through method,which was conducted by a single operator,exceeded the precision requirement.id.
finally,the court of international trade held that the tiles were eligible for treatment under the gsp because of the value of the tiles was produced in mexico.id.at.indeed,the court of international trade held that the tiles were percent mexican products since the components were substantially transformed into new and different articles of commerce in mexico.id.at.additionally,according to the court of international trade,even if the components are excluded from the value of the wall tile the remainder still exceeds the required minimum threshold.id.at.the court of international trade thus concluded that t he articles are to be classified under item,tsus and t hey are also entitled to entry under the gsp.id.at.this appeal ensued.
