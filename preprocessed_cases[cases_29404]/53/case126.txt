this appeal raises the issue of whether the court of international trade cit has exclusive jurisdiction to entertain claims brought by an importer challenging the legality of forfeiture and penalty assessment actions taken by the united states customs service customs.nippon miniature bearing corporation nmb brought action in the district court for declaratory and injunctive relief,claiming that customs acted outside the scope of its authority when it seized nmb goods and initiated administrative penalty proceedings under section of the tariff act,and that such actions violated nmb constitutional rights.the district court granted customs motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction finding that nmb claims fell within the exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of the court of international trade cit.nmb now appeals.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
nmb is an importer of miniature steel ball bearings.from to,nmb imported into the united states ball bearings that were comprised of a steel alloy which its parent company,minebea,had developed.these bearings were described in customs entry documentation with parts numbers bearing the prefix ss.customs avers that the designation ss is used in the steel industry to indicate that a product is made of stainless steel.
in the,customs began an investigation into nmb importation practices.it concluded that by using the prefix ss in its parts number,nmb was implicitly representing that the ball bearings were made of stainless steel when in fact the ball bearings were of a different chemical component.customs determined that this labeling of the ball bearings constituted a material misrepresentation and that it was therefore illegal to import such items into the united states customs found that the importation of such items was actionable under and.as a result of this investigation,customs in seized,pursuant to and c,nineteen shipments of ball bearings that were being entered into los angeles by nmb.
in order to obtain the return of its merchandise,nmb sought a quick release of the seized goods.customs granted the release on the condition that nmb provide substitute letters of credit which nmb agreed would serve as a substitute res in any forfeiture proceeding.nmb also submitted a petition for remission of the forfeiture.after considering nmb petition,customs offered to remit the forfeiture upon nmb payment of which it found to equal the dutiable value of the seized ball bearings.nmb filed a supplemental petition for remission which customs denied.
nmb then paid the penalty imposed.the parties disagree as to whether this payment was made without protest.nmb first submitted the payment with a cover letter that stated that the payment was being made under protest.when customs informed nmb counsel that it would not accept any payment under protest,nmb submitted the payment under a cover letter from which the objectionable term had been deleted and customs returned the letters of credit.nmb contends,however,that it never agreed to forego its right to seek judicial remedies in regard to the payment.
pursuant to its investigation,customs determined that,in addition to the shipments seized,nmb had imported approximately additional shipments of ball bearings which nmb had identified as being composed of stainless steal but were in fact made of a different alloy.in october,customs issued notices to nmb and minebea advising that customs was considering issuing penalties against them pursuant to,for falsely describing the goods imported in the other entries.after considering written responses to the notices submitted by nmb and minebea and conducting a further investigation,customs determined that nmb and minebea had violated.customs then issued notices of penalties to both parties.
in june,nmb and minebea filed a petition explaining why they should not be penalized for the alleged violation.after considering the petition,customs decided not to mitigate the penalties and customs so informed nmb and minebea.nmb and minebea filed a supplemental petition which customs also rejected.
on december,nmb filed an action against customs in the district court for the central district of california.nmb claimed that customs had violated its due process and free speech rights protected by the united states constitution by subjecting its goods to forfeiture and by initiating administrative penalty proceedings against it.nmb further asserted that customs actions were arbitrary,capricious,and outside of its statutory and regulatory authority.in this action,nmb sought a declaration that the penalty proceedings instituted against nmb be found unlawful and set aside injunctions enjoining further penalty proceedings against nmb and injunctions ordering customs to return nmb seized property.
after nmb and minebea failed to pay the civil penalties assessed against them by customs,customs referred the matter to the department of justice doj.on december,the doj,on behalf of the united states,filed an action against nmb and minebea in the cit.
on april,customs filed a motion to dismiss nmb district court action based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,or in the alternative,for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.on may,the district court held a hearing on customs motion.finding that all of nmb claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the cit,the district court granted customs motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.this appeal followed.
this court reviews de novo a district court determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction.pentax myhra,cir.
nmb seeks in this action to challenge the legality of customs forfeiture and administrative penalty proceedings.it bases its challenges on both constitutional and statutory grounds.the general provision,would generally give the district court jurisdiction to hear such challenges provided that the government had waived its sovereign immunity with regard to these claims.k mart cartier,d.the district court would be divested of jurisdiction,however,if this action fell within one of several specific grants of exclusive jurisdiction to the court of international trade.id.at.the government claims that and provide the cit with exclusive jurisdiction over its penalty assessment proceedings and that nmb had waived the right to judicial review of customs seizure action.the district court found that the claims fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the cit and that it therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction.in its decision,however,the district court did not distinguish between the two separate customs actions that were the subject of nmb cause of action.because the statutory authority and judicial review process for the forfeiture and penalty assessment actions are separate and distinct,the determination of where jurisdiction lies to review the actions must be analyzed separately.the district court erred in failing to distinguish between the two causes of action.
section provides the cit with exclusive jurisdiction over civil enforcement claims brought by the united states.specifically,states 
the court of international trade shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action which arises out of an import transaction and which is commenced by the united states 
to recover a civil penalty under section,b,d a,i,or i of the tariff act of 
to recover upon a bond relating to the importation of merchandise required by laws of the united states or by the secretary of the treasury or 
to recover customs duties.
section further provides that i n any civil action in the court of international trade,the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to render judgment upon any counterclaim,or third party action of any party if such claim or action involves the imported merchandise that is the subject matter of the civil action.the government posits that,pursuant to this statutory scheme,the cit has exclusive jurisdiction to hear all claims arising from customs enforcement of section.
nmb avers that this interpretation of the ambit of cit jurisdiction is contravened by the federal circuit decision in trayco,united states,and the analysis set forth in k mart,d.both trayco and k mart stand for the proposition that the cit does not have exclusive jurisdiction over all challenges to laws and regulations.see trayco,at k mart,at.neither case,however,answers the precise question at bar,whether a district court has jurisdiction to entertain suits challenging a customs penalty assessment determination.
trayco involved an action brought by an importer for a refund of a penalty imposed by customs pursuant to a.on appeal the government argued that congress intended,by the detailed and comprehensive statutory scheme of the customs court act of,to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the court of international trade for actions,like the instant one,that involve disputes regarding penalties arising from the importation of mislabeled items.id.at.relying on the plain language of the statute the federal circuit rejected this argument,stating 
section of title grants exclusive jurisdiction to the court of international trade over civil actions arising out of import transactions commenced by the united states.trayco action against the government meets two of the three jurisdictional requirements of section it is a civil action arising out of an import transaction.the united states,however,did not commence this lawsuit in the district court.we reject the government argument that no jurisdictional gap exists because congress failed in section to explicitly grant the court of international trade jurisdiction of civil actions arising out of import transactions commenced by an importer.
the court acknowledged that under the statutory scheme,the importer could have obtained judicial review in the court of international trade by refusing to pay the penalty and waiting for the government to commence an enforcement action.id.at.it found,however,that the statutory framework did not require such a course of action.pursuant to the tucker act,a,a federal district court has jurisdiction to hear an action for reimbursement of a penalty illegally assessed by customs where the importer asserts a substantive right enforceable against the united states for money damages.because t he refund of a penalty improperly exacted pursuant to an act of congress is a substantive right for money damages,the court found that the importer met the jurisdictional prerequisites of section a and the district court properly exercised jurisdiction.id.at.
the federal circuit interpretation of the ambit of the cit exclusive jurisdiction under supports nmb assertion that the cit would not have jurisdiction to hear a challenge to a customs penalty assessment brought by an importer.the trayco opinion,however,does not support the nmb conclusion that therefore the district court has jurisdiction to hear such a challenge.in finding that jurisdiction over the refund claim lay in the district court,the federal circuit relied not on general federal jurisdiction,but rather on the tucker act.because nmb,in challenging the penalty assessment determination,does not seek recovery of a penalty paid or money damages against the united states,the district court was without jurisdiction to hear this suit under the tucker act.
nmb reliance on the supreme court analysis of the ambit of the cit exclusive jurisdiction in k mart is also misplaced.in k mart,an association of trademark owners brought an action in district court challenging the validity of a customs regulation which permitted importation of certain goods at.the supreme court held that because the challenge did not fall within one of the specific grants of exclusive jurisdiction to the cit,the district court had jurisdiction to hear a challenge to the regulation pursuant to and a id.at.the supreme court,however,did not comment upon the ambit of the cit exclusive jurisdiction over civil penalty assessment actions nor does the analysis set forth support the conclusion that an importer has a right to review of such assessment actions.rather,k mart instructs that the determination of where jurisdiction lies to hear a suit involving challenges to import regulations turns on the precise contours of the exclusive jurisdiction provided to the cit as well as the claimed basis for the district court jurisdiction.
at first blush,it appears that a case like the one at bar,involving a challenge to a penalty assessment determination would fall squarely into the jurisdictional gap created by the cit statutory grant of exclusive jurisdiction,as did the importer challenges in trayco and k mart.this case,however,does not require consideration of whether residual subject matter jurisdiction might exist in the district court under and.as a practical matter,the district court lacks jurisdiction to decide an importer challenge to a assessment because the case is not ripe for review under the apa.section of the apa provides that only a gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court,are subject to review.see also bowen massachusetts,d tucson airport,cir.nmb can point to no statute which provides for review of an importer initiated challenge to a penalty assessment.thus,the agency action complained of here is only reviewable under the apa if it constitutes final agency action,for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.
in order for an agency action to be deemed final at least two conditions must exist.first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.and second,the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences flow.bennett spear,d internal citations and quotation marks deleted.although nmb is correct in asserting that the first requirement is met here,we find that the second requirement is not met and therefore review is not provided under the apa.
customs assessment of penalties pursuant to does not constitute a final agency action because it does not determine the rights or obligations of an importer,nor are there legal consequences flowing from the administrative determination that a penalty is owed.during the administrative review stages of a penalty assessment action,an importer is under no obligation to pay an assessed penalty.such an obligation only arises after the cit conducts a de novo review of all issues in a government initiated enforcement proceeding and determines whether a penalty is due and the amount of any such penalty.see e providing for de novo review by the cit of all issues in a proceeding commenced by the united states for the recovery of any monetary penalty claimed under see also playhouse import export,united states,noting that,prior to a government initiated enforcement proceeding,an importer does not suffer a cognizable injury as a result of an administrative penalty assessment determination.as there are no legal consequences resulting from a customs penalty assessment determination,there is no final agency action and and of the apa do not vest the district court with jurisdiction to review the penalty assessment.
a review of jurisdictional provisions of the customs court act of also persuades us that this is not the type of agency action for which congress intended to permit review in a district court.abbott laboratories gardner,d.in enacting the jurisdictional provisions,congress intended,first and foremost,to remedy the confusion over the division of jurisdiction between the customs court now the court of international trade and the district courts and to ensure uniformity in the judicial decisionmaking process.k mart,at.citing.to achieve uniformity,congress delineated precisely the matters over which the cit would have exclusive jurisdiction.id.congress granted the cit exclusive jurisdiction over government initiated penalty enforcement proceedings and,once such a suit is commenced,over all counterclaims,or actions involving the imported merchandise which is the subject matter of the enforcement proceedings.moreover,congress provided the cit with all the powers in law and equity
