manufacturing,aramis,and clinique laboratories,collectively appeal from the decision of the united states court of international trade granting the government for summary judgment that various cosmetic bags imported by were properly classified under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus.united states,d.int l trade.because we conclude that the united states court of international trade correctly classified the imported goods,we affirm.
the imported goods at issue are small bags made of polyvinyl sheeting imported for use in cosmetic sales promotions,d at.these cosmetics bags are supple,and not supported by frames.id.at.they are of differing shapes and sizes and were variously invoiced by as rectangular bag,halfmoon bag,fabric bag,travel bag,pvc sponge bag,reusable bag,cosmetic case,cosmetic bag,gwp sunnysider,hatbox bag,new stone open bag,horizontal tote,fabric mirror pouch,nylon cosmetic bag,generic bag,nylon drawstring bag,and cosmetic pouch.id.the parties have stipulated that the cosmetics bags were intended to be used to contain and to organize and segregate cosmetics and toiletry products.id.at.
the united states customs service customs initially classified the polyvinyl cosmetic bags at issue under subheading a residual provision covering t ravel,sports and similar bags dutiable at a rate of percent ad valorem.id.at.protested this classification and subsequently challenged it in the court of international trade.contended that the bags were properly classified as a rticles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag under subheading dutiable at a rate of cents per kilogram plus percent ad valorem.id.at.before the court of international trade,the government argued that,as an alternative to customs initial classification,the bags could be classified as vanity cases under subheading dutiable at a rate of percent ad valorem.id.
on for summary judgment,the court of international trade rejected customs initial classification and held the bags properly classifiable as vanity cases under subheading.id.at.although it found the cosmetics bags prima facie classifiable as both vanity cases and a rticles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or the handbag,the court concluded that,under the rule of specificity,the merchandise at issue was most appropriately classified as vanity cases.
in reaching this conclusion,the court first found that the bags were properly classified under heading,which covers travel goods,handbags and similar containers,and then considered classification under each of the three competing subheadings advocated by the parties.beginning with subheading,the court noted that this subheading includes an eo nomine tariff designation for vanity cases.id.at.finding that the term was not clearly defined within htsus and that congress did not specify any intent as to the definition of the term,the court turned to dictionary sources.after comparing several definitions,the court concluded that the common meaning of the term vanity case includes a small handbag or case used to hold cosmetics.id.the court rejected an argument by that this definition should be narrowed based on terminology used in the drafting process allegedly indicating that the term vanity cases,as used in htsus,was intended to be the equivalent of a french term that meant a small piece of luggage for carrying cosmetics.id.at.accordingly,finding that cosmetics bags met the common meaning of vanity cases,the court held them to be prima facie classifiable under subheading.id.at.
turning to subheading,a rticles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag,the court noted that the parties had stipulated that the cosmetics bags were small enough to be carried in a handbag and that women frequently carry cosmetics in their handbags.id.at.in addition,the court cited expert testimony that women normally carry cosmetics bags in their handbags.id.accordingly,the court held that cosmetic bags were prima facie classifiable under subheading.id.at.
in considering the last of the three competing subheadings,the court held that because it had found the merchandise at issue prima facie classifiable under two alternative subheadings that covered the cosmetic bags more specifically,classification under the residual provision encompassing t ravel,sports and similar bags would be incorrect.id.at.the court therefore rejected classification under subheading.id.
with respect to the remaining two subheadings,the court applied the rule of specificity set out in htsus general rules of interpretation gris.id.at.gri a provides that t he sub heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to sub headings providing a more general description.id.the court noted that,generally,a use provision,a provision describing articles by the manner in which they are used as opposed to by name was considered more specific than an eo nomine provision in which an item is identified by name.id.however,the court also noted that this rule only applies when two subheadings equally describe the item at issue,and concluded that in this case,vanity cases more specifically describes the bags at issue.id.the court therefore held that the bags were more appropriately classified as vanity cases under subheading rather than as a rticles of a kind normally carried in the pocket or in the handbag under subheading.
we review the court of international trade grant of summary judgment without deference.mead united states.if we determine that there is no dispute of material fact,our review of the classification of the goods collapses into a determination of the proper meaning and scope of the htsus terms that,as a matter of statutory construction,is a question of law,which we review de novo.aves.in leather,united states,citing mead,at.

htsus terms are construed according to their common and commercial meanings,which are presumed to be the same absent contrary legislative intent.am.processing united states.in construing a tariff term,the court may rely on its own understanding of the term as well as upon lexicographic and scientific authorities.mita copystar am.united states.the court may also refer to the explanatory notes accompanying a tariff subheading.id.while these notes are not controlling legislative history,they are nonetheless intended to clarify the scope of htsus subheadings and to offer guidance in their interpretation.id.
the principal issue in this appeal involves the correct definition of the tariff term vanity case.as described above,the court of international trade found that vanity case meant a small handbag or case used to hold cosmetics,which ultimately led it to conclude that the bags were properly classified as vanity cases under subheading of htsus.contends that this definition violates fundamental rules of statutory construction because t he dictionary definitions on which the court relied were inconsistent,vague and overly broad and the court failed to resolve these discrepancies.thus,argues that the trial court erred,inter alia,because its definition improperly fails to incorporate expert testimony regarding the characteristics of vanity cases,is impermissibly broad,and violates the legislative intent underlying htsus.the government responds that the trial court definition correctly reflects the common meaning of vanity case,is consistent with settled principles of statutory construction,and does not contravene legislative intent.we address these arguments in turn.
as an initial matter,contends that because the lexicographical definitions or meaning of the term are vague,ambiguous or overly broad,the trial court was required to look to other sources to clarify the common and commercial meaning of the tariff term vanity cases.specifically,len ron argues that because the dictionary definitions of vanity case were not entirely consistent,the court was required to find this term ambiguous and rely on the definitions offered by experts to resolve this alleged ambiguity.although the court definition reflected the predominant definition found in dictionary sources,contends that uncontroverted expert testimony was available to the court to establish that a fitted or integrated mirror is an essential characteristic of every type of vanity bag,case,or box or even compact and therefore should have been included in the court definition.at oral argument,counsel for confirmed that,in view,all of the bags in question would come within the proper definition of vanity case if they contained mirrors.thus,according to,the single necessary characteristic missing from the trial court definition is apparently a fitted or integrated mirror.
as the government correctly points out,the majority of dictionary definitions make no mention of a mirror and are consistent with the trial court definition.only one dictionary definition provided by lists a mirror as a necessary characteristic of a vanity case.accordingly,we disagree with assertion that this case presents the type and scope of ambiguity that required the trial court to narrow and refine the definition of vanity case in the manner proposed by.we conclude that the court properly relied on the definition most commonly found in the lexicographical sources to derive the common meaning of this term.
one who argues that a term in the tariff laws should not be given its common or dictionary meaning must prove that there is a different commercial meaning in existence which is definite,uniform,and general throughout the trade.rohm haas united states,citing moscahlades united states.we do not find expert testimony sufficient to demonstrate a sufficiently definite and uniform commercial or trade meaning requiring all vanity cases to have mirrors.
moreover,the government provided testimony from a customs employee that a vanity case had the characteristics of providing storage,protection,portability,and organization of cosmetics.he also stated that vanity cases can run the gamut from a relatively large train case to a small case for the application of cosmetics,such as a compact.these statements further support the trial court broad reading of the term.accordingly,we agree with the trial court definition and hold that has failed to show that a mirror is a necessary aspect of a vanity case,and,therefore,has failed to demonstrate a sufficiently definite and uniform trade definition to overcome the presumption that t he meaning of a tariff term is the same as its common or dictionary meaning.brookside veneers,united states,quoting rohm haas,at.similarly,we hold that has failed to demonstrate that the common or commercial meaning of vanity cases requires that the case be fitted with a mirror 
next contends that the court definition is so overbroad that it overlaps with other classification subheadings such as those covering handbags.argues that because virtually all women keep cosmetics in their handbags,then,by the court own reasoning,all small handbags would be classifiable as vanity cases,violating the rule that a statutory provision should not be read so as to make another superfluous.see,duncan walker,d counseling against such statutory constructions.len ron argues that the court should have applied the principle of noscitur a sociis,known from its associates,which states that a statutory term should be interpreted through an analysis of the meaning of associated words,to narrow its definition of vanity cases.see jewelpak united states,explaining the principle of noscitur a sociis.applying this principle,argues that,because the articles listed in subheading include trunks,suitcases,attaché cases,briefcases,and school satchels,subheading was intended to refer to travel articles that are of substantial construction and designed for independent and external carriage,and,thus,that vanity cases must be interpreted to have these attributes.
citing lynteq,united states,the government responds that,absent an indication of legislative intent to the contrary,an eo nomine designation without terms of limitation includes all forms of the article.accordingly,argues the government,resort to the principle of noscitur a sociis to narrow an eo nomine provision is warranted only when there is doubt as to the meaning of a statutory term.thus,because the common meaning of the term vanity case can be ascertained by reference to lexicographical sources,the government contends that the application of this principle would be inappropriate here.
we agree with the court of international trade and the government that,in this case,all forms of the articles described as vanity cases were meant by congress to be included in the definition of that term.as the court noted,an eo nomine designation,with no terms of limitation,will ordinarily include all forms of the named article,d at quoting carl zeiss,united states,citation omitted.we find argument that a broad definition of vanity case will impermissibly subsume other subheadings,such as those covering handbags,unpersuasive.both customs and the courts have demonstrated their ability to distinguish between articles based on their essential or primary use or characteristic.see,sports graphics,united states.in affirming the court of international trade conclusion that vanity case means a small handbag or case used to hold cosmetics,however,we clarify that for a handbag or case to be classified as a vanity case,containing,carrying,or organizing cosmetics must be its predominant use,rather than simply one possible use.
we also agree with the government that,having found the term vanity case correctly defined by reference to lexicographical sources,it is unnecessary for us to resort to the principle of noscitur a sociis to determine the meaning of this phrase.however,to the extent that any doubt regarding the proper definition might remain,we note that acknowledgment at oral argument that the addition of a mirror to the cosmetics bags at issue would bring them within the correct definition of vanity cases severely undermines its argument that vanity cases must be of substantial construction and designed for independent and external carriage because has represented that its bags are supple,and not supported by frames and not appropriate for extended independent carriage.accordingly,as noted above,len ron appears to have acknowledged that,despite its other arguments,the single essential characteristic missing from the court definition is the presence of an integrated or fitted mirror and not the requirement that the article have the characteristics of luggage.moreover,especially in light of the clear evidence that the common meaning of vanity case is not restricted to a type of luggage,we find any inference to the contrary that might be derived by applying the principle of noscitur a sociis to be insufficiently persuasive to overcome the presumption that the meaning of a tariff term is the same as its common or dictionary meaning.see brookside veneers,at quoting rohm haas,at.
next argument is similarly undercut by its acknowledgment that its cosmetics bags would become vanity cases with the addition of mirrors.contends that the drafting history of htsus demonstrates that the eo nomine terms vanity cases and mallettes de toilette,were,respectively,added in the english and french drafts of heading and were intended to have the same meaning.because mallette means little trunk,contends that the drafters intended mallettes de toilette and vanity cases to be interpreted to describe pieces of fitted luggage.
the government responds that working documents reflecting the drafting history of htsus were merely designed to frame issues for discussion and should be accorded very little weight in interpreting ta
