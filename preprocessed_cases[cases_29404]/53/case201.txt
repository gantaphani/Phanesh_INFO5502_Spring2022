background 
in,commerce imposed an antidumping duty order on honey imported from the people republic of china china.honey from the people republic of china.dep t of commerce,notice of amended final determination of sales at less than fair value and antidumping duty order the order.in january,commerce initiated the tenth administrative review of the order for the period of review december,through november.initiation of antidumping countervailing duty administrative reviews requests for revocation in part.dep t of commerce,initiation.dongtai peak was named a respondent in this review.id.at.
as part of the review,on march,commerce issued a economy questionnaire the questionnaire to dongtai peak,which included section a general information,with a deadline of march,and sections c sales to the united states and d factors of production,with a deadline of april.appellant timely filed a response to section a of the questionnaire,and filed its responses to sections c and d after receiving a extension of the deadline from commerce.because appellant extension request was received less than six minutes before the submission deadline for sections c and d,in granting the request commerce stated to ensure that commerce is fully able to consider requests of this nature,we advise peak to plan accordingly and file any future extension requests as soon as it suspects additional time may be necessary.
on april,commerce issued a supplemental section a questionnaire the supplemental questionnaire to address certain deficiencies in dongtai peak original section a response.the deadline to respond to the supplemental questionnaire was cob close of business,april.however,dongtai peak failed to submit its response by this deadline.instead,on april,dongtai peak filed an untimely request the april letter to extend the deadline to april,claiming good cause for an extension existed because of the overlap with the deadline to file its responses to sections c and d,a national holiday,and various issues with its translator,its united attorneys,and its computers.in response,the american honey producers association and sioux honey association petitioners submitted an objection to the untimely extension request.on april,appellant submitted a response to the objection,restating its claim that good cause existed for the extension.then,on april,dongtai peak submitted a second request for an additional extension of the deadline the april letter.following the close of business on april,appellant submitted its response to the supplemental questionnaire the supplemental response without commerce having granted the extension requests in the april or april letters.
on may,commerce denied dongtai peak extension requests because good cause did not exist to extend retroactively its deadline.commerce noted although appellant explained why it could not timely file its supplemental response,it provided no explanation as to why it was unable to file its extension request in a timely manner prior to the deadline for its questionnaire response.it also noted dongtai peak had previously been cautioned with respect to late extension requests when it requested an extension of the deadline to file its section c and d questionnaire responses five minutes before the deadline for that questionnaire response.commerce therefore removed appellant extension requests and its supplemental response from the official record.
dongtai peak requested reconsideration of this determination,but commerce upheld its decision to deny the extension requests and to remove the requests and the supplemental response from the record in its preliminary results.honey from the people republic of china,dep t of commerce,preliminary results.in doing so,commerce again noted the april letter did not address dongtai peak inability to file an extension request by the deadline,and stated the deadline was significant because commerce had found appellant united states sales to be fide in prior reviews,and therefore needed time for a full analysis of the information sought in the supplemental questionnaire.id.accordingly,in the preliminary results,commerce determined that without the supplemental response,the record lacked sufficient information to calculate a separate rate for dongtai peak,and therefore the company would be considered part of the entity.id.at.in addition,commerce determined the entity did not cooperate to the best of its ability during the review,and therefore commerce relied entirely on adverse facts available afa to determine the dumping margin for the entity.id.commerce selected a rate of per kilogram based on the rate calculated for anhui native produce import export corporation anhui native during the sixth administrative review,which had also been assigned to the entity in the sixth and seventh administrative reviews.id.at.

ii.proceedings 
in december,dongtai peak filed an action in the cit challenging several aspects of the final results,including the denial of its extension requests and the removal of those requests and the supplemental response from the record commerce decision to consider dongtai peak part of the entity commerce use of afa to calculate the dumping margin for the rate and the per kilogram afa rate itself.dongtai peak moved for judgment on the agency record,which the cit denied on march.
in response to dongtai peak argument that commerce improperly rejected its extension requests and removed the filings from the record,the cit found commerce determinations were consistent with its regulations and within its discretion.in addition,the cit found commerce reasonably determined that dongtai peak extension requests were unsupported by good cause because commerce found appellant failed to comply with the regulations by filing its extension requests after the deadline expired the facts of the instant case did not warrant granting dongtai peak untimely requests and appellant was aware of the deadline in question and its particular importance.dongtai peak,d at citing issues.mem.at.the cit also found commerce denial of the extension requests did not violate appellant statutory rights because the company had notice of the deadline and an opportunity to comply,but simply failed to file a timely extension request.id.at.
as to dongtai peak argument that commerce improperly denied it separate rate status,the cit found commerce reasonably concluded that without the supplemental response,t he record lacked certain information regarding dongtai peak separate rate eligibility because it failed to timely file its extension requests and failed to show good cause to extend the deadline.id.at.as to appellant initial section a response that remained on the record,the cit found the company did not identify any evidence in that response demonstrating the lack of government control as required for separate rate status.id.although there were translations of chinese law and information concerning peak ownership and corporate structure in the initial section a response,the cit found this did not render commerce decisions unsupported by substantial evidence.id.thus,the cit held commerce reasonably included dongtai peak in the entity.
regarding dongtai peak challenge to commerce use of afa in calculating the rate,the cit found commerce determination was reasonable and consistent with law.id.at.in particular,the cit observed commerce did not simply equate dongtai peak untimely submission with a failure to cooperate,but considered the circumstances of dongtai peak untimely submission.id.as to the actual rate calculated using afa,the cit noted dongtai peak provided no evidence of market fluctuations or other changes in the chinese honey industry since the review,and therefore its bare assertion that such changes occurred is insufficient to undermine commerce selection of anhui native rate to determine the margin for the china wide entity.id.at.the cit therefore concluded commerce selection of the rate was supported by substantial evidence.
dongtai peak filed a timely appeal and this court has jurisdiction under a.

standard of review 
this court reviews decisions of the cit de novo,apply ing anew the same standard used by the cit.mittal steel point lisas united states.under that standard,this court must uphold commerce determinations unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i.although such review amounts to repeating the work of the cit,we have noted that this court will not ignore the informed opinion of the cit.diamond sawblades mfrs.coal.united states,quoting suramerica de aleaciones laminadas,united states,see also cleo united states,when performing a substantial evidence review,we give great weight to the informed opinion of the cit.indeed,it is nearly always the starting point of our analysis.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.

ii.legal framework 
the antidumping statute authorizes commerce to impose duties on imported goods that are sold in the united states at value if it is determined that a domestic industry is materially injured,or threated with material injury.see.once an antidumping duty order covering certain goods is in place,commerce periodically reviews and reassesses antidumping duties during administrative reviews.gallant ocean thai.united states,citing u,a.
in calculating antidumping margins,commerce generally determines individual dumping margins separate rates for each known exporter or producer.c.if it is not practicable to calculate individual dumping margins for every exporter or producer,commerce may examine a reasonable number of respondents mandatory respondents,such as dongtai peak.see id.c.in antidumping duty proceedings involving merchandise from a economy however,commerce presumes that all respondents are and therefore subject to a single rate.see sigma united states.respondents may rebut this presumption and become eligible for a separate rate by establishing the absence of both de jure and de facto government control.id.if a respondent fails to establish its independence,commerce relies upon the presumption of government control and applies the rate to that respondent.transcom,united states.
iii.commerce properly exercised its discretion in rejecting appellant extension requests and supplemental response 
on appeal,dongtai peak repeats the arguments it raised before the cit.first,appellant argues commerce rejection of and removal from the record of its extension requests and the supplemental response was improper and not in accordance with law because dongtai peak established good cause to extend the deadline.in particular,appellant claims good cause was shown in the april letter which described dongtai peak 
difficulties encountered in overseas communication between appellant and its counsel difficulties encountered in communication between appellant and its translator difficulties encountered as a consequence of a day long chinese national holiday debilitating computer system malfunctions and related repair efforts and the unexpected burden to appellant personnel of having to prepare responses to the supplemental questionnaire and its section c and d questionnaires over an overlapping timeframe.
appellant br.in addition,in contrast to dongtai peak purported showing of good cause,appellant contends commerce articulated no basis for its conclusion,such as exactly how or why the explanation provided in the april letter does not constitute good cause,and therefore its determination is not supported by substantial evidence,and it remains vague as to exactly what commerce means by good cause.id.
relying on other administrative proceedings,dongtai peak argues commerce has a long practice of keeping extension requests on the case record,and approving them,even when they are submitted subsequent to the applicable time limit,and has articulated no legally valid reason for its departure from this practice in the underlying review proceeding.id.at.in addition,appellant asserts that while commerce claimed it needed time to fully consider extension requests,there were no pressing deadlines in the present case that would have made acceptance and granting of the extension request at all rushed or difficult.id.at.to appellant,this case involve s a small amount of information a mere supplemental questionnaire dealing with a single section,and when appellant submitted its supplemental response,there were many months yet before commerce final results were due.that is,there was ample time for commerce to complete a very thorough and comprehensive analysis.id.at emphasis added.finally,dongtai peak argues fairness and accuracy also require that commerce accept the late submission because commerce refusal to extend the deadline unfairly prejudiced appellant right to receive its own calculated rate using its own information.id.at.
under b commerce may,for good cause,extend any time limit established by this part.a party may request an extension b efore the applicable time limit expires,and such a request must be in writing,and state the reasons for the request.id.c emphasis added.if commerce refuses to extend the time limit,it will not consider or retain in the official record of the proceeding u ntimely filed factual information,written argument,or other material that the secretary rejects.id.d i.
the united states supreme court has clarified that,a bsent constitutional constraints or extremely compelling circumstances,the administrative agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.accordingly,absent such constraints or circumstances,courts will defer to the judgment of an agency regarding the development of the agency record.psc vsmpo avisma united states.in addition,i n order for commerce to fulfill its mandate to administer the antidumping duty law,including its obligation to calculate accurate dumping margins,it must be permitted to enforce the time frame provided in its regulations.yantai timken united states,d.int l trade.
here,commerce properly exercised its discretion in rejecting dongtai peak extension requests and supplemental responses because the extension requests were submitted after the established deadline in violation of c,and appellant failed to show good cause for an extension as required by b.as to its good cause arguments,commerce properly found dongtai peak april letter describing its difficulties in completing the supplemental response did not demonstrate why the company was unable to file timely its extension request.indeed,all of the causes of delay noted in the april letter were known to appellant prior to the april deadline,and did not prevent the company from filing an extension request before that date.see issues.mem.at n one of these reasons explained why dongtai peak was unable to file the extension request before the existing april,deadline and none of these reasons constitute good cause to grant a extension request,especially in the context of an administrative review it requested itself.indeed,the record shows the company was closed for the chinese holiday from april through the computer difficulties occurred sometime between april and and the deadline for the sections c and d responses was april.
thus,commerce reasonably determined dongtai peak was entirely capable of at least submitting an extension request on time,but simply failed to do so therefore,good cause did not exist to retroactively extend the deadline.issues.mem.at see b,c.having properly denied the extension requests,commerce also reasonably determined the supplemental response was untimely and removed it from the record pursuant to d.
as to dongtai peak claim that commerce failed to identify why the april letter did not establish good cause,appellant misunderstands its obligation to submit a written extension request before the time limit specified by commerce and to state the reasons for the request.id.c.that is,commerce was not required to demonstrate good cause for rejecting dongtai peak untimely submissions.as the government notes,i t is not for dongtai peak to establish commerce deadlines or to dictate to commerce whether and when commerce actually needs the requested information.united states br.see psc vsmpo,at it is fully within commerce discretion to set and enforce deadlines and this court can not set aside application of a proper administrative procedure because it believes that properly excluded evidence would yield a more accurate result if the evidence were considered.
appellant argument regarding commerce long practice of approving untimely extension requests is equally unpersuasive.as noted,commerce may grant extension requests if it determines the extension request provides good cause for extending the deadline.b.in the various administrative reviews cited by appellant,commerce found good cause was shown and therefore exercised its discretion in granting the untimely extension requests.here,by contrast,commerce did not find good cause.in addition,dongtai peak argument ignores the fact that commerce also routinely rejects submissions.in this case,moreover,commerce explicitly cautioned dongtai peak on several occasions against making untimely extension requests.see,to ensure that commerce is fully able to consider requests of this nature,we advise peak to plan accordingly and file any future extension requests as soon as it suspects additional time may be necessary.
as to dongtai peak presumption that commerce had adequate time to process this review,commerce should not be burdened by requiring acceptance of untimely filings closer to the final deadline for the administrative review.while appellant claims this case involves a mere supplemental questionnaire that commerce had ample time to review,appellant br,the supplemental questionnaire is actually comprised of nine pages of questions regarding dongtai peak management,shareholders,accounting practices,affiliations,united states sales,domestic sales,and merchandise,and was due less than four months before the deadline for commerce to issue the preliminary results.furthermore,as commerce specifically noted,the deadlines in this case were important because in two prior reviews commerce found dongtai peak united states sales to be not bona fide,a determination that requires careful consideration of the totality of circumstances.see issues.mem.at.thus,the supplemental questionnaire was intended to elicit information regarding dongtai peak reported quantity and value,its separate rate status,structure and affiliations,sales process,accounting and financial practices and merchandising,information which has proven vital to commerce prior fide analyses.id.commerce fully explained its need for a significant amount of time and effort to gather the necessary information,consider the facts of the record,and provide interested parties with an appropriate period for comments and rebuttal comments.id.at.
as to dongtai peak fairness and accuracy argument,this court has made clear commerce rejection of factual information does not violate a respondent due process rights when the respondent had notice of the deadline and an opportunity to reply.see psc vsmpo,at.here,the record shows dongtai peak was afforded both notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.in particular,as commerce noted,appellant was well aware of the established deadlines in this case commerce advised dongtai peak of the importance of submitting its documents in a timely manner and peak was aware of the consequences of its not doing so.issues.mem.at citations omitted.
accordingly,because dongtai peak failed to establish good cause with respect to its failure to submit its extension requests in a timely manner,commerce reasonably exercised its discretion in rejecting the requests and in enforcing the applicable deadline.
iv.commerce decision to deny appellant separate rate status was supported by substantial evidence and was in accordance with law 
next,dongtai peak argues commerce erred in denying it separate rate status because t he record contained substantial and compelling evidence indicating that appellant is eligible for a separate rate.appellant br.specifically,appellant claims the initial section a questionnaire included no less than ten pages of questions,including extensive questions specifically addressing separate rate eligibility,and dongtai peak provided extensive narrative responses to these questions,as well as all required supporting documentation.id.at.in addition,appellant claims,there was no record evidence that its export activities were subject to government control,so commerce conclusion that appellant was not entitled to separate rate status was not based on substantial evidence.dongtai peak also argues the supplemental questionnaire did not directly address government control at all,but merely included a handful of questions in what commerce labeled as the separate rates section of its supplemental questionnaire having to do with prior work experience and responsibilities of appellant management and ownership.id.at.
as noted,in antidumping proceedings involving merchandise from a economy,commerce presumes all respondents are and therefore subject to the rate.see sigma,at.respondents may rebut this presumption and establish eligibility for a separate rate through evidence of the absence of both de jure and de facto government control.id.if a respondent fails to do so,however,commerce may rely upon the presumption of government control and apply the rate to that respondent.transcom,at.
here,substantial evidence supports commerce determination that dongtai peak failed to demonstrate the absence of de facto and de jure government control,as required for status,and therefore that the company is part of the entity.contrary to dongtai peak contention,the company initial section a response was insufficient to establish its separate rate eligibility.without a supplemental response,commerce did not have information regarding dongtai peak shareholders,management,accounting practices,corporate structure,and affiliations,and information addressing whether several organizations to which dongtai peak belonged were,controlled dongtai peak business operations or coordinated dongtai peak export activities.issues.mem.at.furthermore,dongtai peak does not identify any evidence in its initial section a response that demonstrates lack of government control.as the cit properly found,while the initial section a response provided some evidence of its eligibility for a separate rate,it was insufficient to render commerce decision unsupported by substantial evidence.dongtai peak,d at.
as to dongtai peak contention that there was no record evidence of government control,this argument ignores that under the law for economy countries,all respondents are presumed to be subject to governmental control unless they meet the burden of proving ot
