in this silicon metal antidumping case,the united states department of commerce commerce initially assessed the dumper financial costs using the consolidated financial statements of its ultimate belgian parent.the united states court of international trade remanded the case to commerce with instructions to recalculate the dumping company financial costs by examining the records of only its immediate brazilian parent.because the court of international trade did not allow commerce to examine the entire record to determine financial costs,this court reverses.
in,commerce found that companhia brasileira carbureto de calcio cbcc,a brazilian producer and exporter of silicon metal,had dumped its product in the united states.commerce then undertook to determine a duty under a a.accordingly,commerce examined silicon metal entering from brazil for the period from july,to june.during its review,commerce learned that solvay do brasil brasil owns of cbcc.moreover,solvay cie of belgium solvay owns of brasil,cbcc parent.thus,in computing cbcc finance key component of the dumping determined that belgian solvay was the ultimate parent corporation of cbcc.
because commerce found that belgian solvay was cbcc ultimate parent,commerce used solvay consolidated financial statements to set cbcc dumping margin.a financial expense ratio figured from these statements became a key component for calculating the cost of production and the value of the silicon metal sold by cbcc in the united states during the review period.see silicon metal from brazil,amended final results of antidumping administrative review,fed.reg,silicon metal from brazil final results of antidumping administrative review and determination not to revoke in part,fed.reg.using the financial expense ratio calculated with the belgian figures,commerce issued a dumping margin for cbcc.
american silicon technologies,skw metal alloys,elkem metal,and globe metallurgical,collectively,american silicon,petitioners in commerce administrative review,disagreed with commerce calculation of cbcc financial expense ratio.instead,american silicon reasoned,commerce should employ the combined financial expenses of cbcc and its immediate parent,brasil.american silicon based this reasoning on record evidence of financial transactions between cbcc and brasil,such as loans and stock transfers.moreover,american silicon argued that brazilian companies ordinarily borrow within domestic credit markets or from brazilian banks,as opposed to seeking credit from external markets.by calculating cbcc financial expense ratio using solvay consolidated financial statements,american silicon contended that commerce inappropriately shifted costs of production away from the subject merchandise.
commerce standard policy for assessing finance costs bases interest expenses and income on fully consolidated financial statements because the cost of capital is fungible.according to commerce,consolidated financial statements indicate that a corporate parent controls a subsidiary.indeed,market analysts use consolidated statements to fairly represent the financial health of parent companies with substantial subsidiary operations.therefore,under standard commerce policy as well as standard accounting principles,majority ownership is prima facie evidence of control over the subsidiary.am.silicon techs.united states,consol.court,slip,wl.int l trade.moreover,the court of international trade has sustained commerce normal practice in calculating financial expense ratios as a permissible interpretation of applicable statutes b b,e a,and f a,the statement of administrative action,and its case law.see,gulf states tube div.of quanex united states.int l trade.
therefore,commerce initially determined solvay had the power to direct the capital structure of cbcc with its controlling interest.because solvay is the ultimate parent of the solvay corporate group and controls cbcc financial expenses,commerce and cbcc relied on solvay consolidated financial statements to calculate cbcc financial expenses.

the trial court remanded to commerce with instructions to recalculate cbcc financial expense ratio utilizing the consolidated financial statements of cbcc and its immediate parent company,brasil,excluding any financial information from belgian solvay,the ultimate parent of both brasil and cbcc.following the remand,commerce reluctantly recalculated cbcc financial expense ratio,asserting in its final remand results the continued belief that the initial calculation was appropriate.the court of international trade disagreed and sustained the remand results.am.silicon techs.united states,consol.court,slip,wl.int l trade.cbcc appeals,asserting error by the court of international trade in denying commerce sufficient deference in its initial calculation of cbcc financial expense ratio based on the consolidated financial statements of its ultimate parent,belgian solvay.

this court must therefore determine whether commerce reasonably calculated general expenses by using solvay consolidated financial documents.in the first place,this court notes that standard accounting principles acknowledge consolidated financial statements as a fair presentation of the financial position of a group.see,floyd beams,advanced accounting,ed.following those practices,commerce has adopted and followed a standard policy for assessing finance costs of a producer based on the consolidated financial statements of a parent because the cost of capital is fungible.commerce policy recognizes that consolidated financial statements indicate that a corporate parent controls a subsidiary.these consolidated statements represent the financial health of parent company operations in view of subsidiary operations.in addition,fungible financial assets invite manipulation.in other words,if commerce used only a single division of a group as the source of financing costs,the controlling entity could shift borrowings from one division to another to defeat accurate accounting.
therefore,under standard commerce policy,as well as standard accounting principles,majority ownership is prima facie evidence of control over the subsidiary.am.silicon,wl,at.moreover,the court of international trade has sustained commerce normal practice of calculating financial expense ratios based on the consolidated financial statements of a parent as a permissible interpretation of applicable statutes b b,e a,and f a,the statement of administrative action,and its case law.see,gulf states tube.at.
as a legal matter,the court of international trade had an obligation to defer to commerce reasonable methodology in the first place,but no such deference was afforded.thus,according proper deference,koyo seiko united states,this court sustains as reasonable commerce well established practice of basing interest expenses and income on fully consolidated financial statements.
in its initial review,commerce considered the facts of record and,after analyzing indicia of parental control over subsidiary cbcc,determined the consolidated financial statements of solvay were appropriate for calculating cbcc financial expense ratio.in reaching this initial decision,commerce relied heavily upon the capability of the ultimate parent company,solvay,to determine the capital structure of its subsidiary,cbcc.commerce found that the majority equity ownership of cbcc by solvay is prima facie evidence of control over cbcc.commerce,however,ended its inquiry here without examining the entire record to determine whether this presumption has been overcome or whether solvay financial statements accurately reflect the actual costs associated with the production of the subject merchandise.the court of international trade misapplied the substantial evidence standard when it required commerce to recalculate the financial costs based on cbcc transactions solely with brasil.the trial court concluded that brasil would be much more likely to have and exercise direct control over the subsidiary.am.silicon,wl,at.the trial court based this conclusion on its reading of the record that brasil and cbcc interact more financially than solvay and cbcc or solvay and brasil.
in the first place,the trial court analysis deviates from commerce practice of acknowledging the role of consolidated statements.instead,the trial court imposed a requirement of adequate financial transactions.specifically,the court of international trade noted that brasil engaged in financing with cbcc with fewer,if any,direct financial exchanges between cbcc and solvay during the relevant period.the court of international trade,however,did not account for whether belgian solvay controlled and accounted for brasil financial transactions with cbcc in the relationships of its subsidiaries.if finance expenses in a dumping margin calculation depended on assessing financial transactions,as the trial court seemed to require,the new kind of test would impose significant new administrative burdens on commerce and invite potential manipulation.the manipulation of this test might take the form of a controlling company selecting a financial cost ratio by directing one of its subsidiaries with a low ratio to lend to the exporter.
further,notwithstanding that the trial court remanded to commerce,that remand foreclosed commerce from undertaking a complete analysis.instead,on remand,the trial court limited commerce examination to cbcc transactions with brasil.this order prevented commerce from further assessing the relationship between brasil and solvay or cbcc and solvay.this limit on the remand methodology further inhibited commerce ability to ensure an accurate assessment of cbcc financial costs.as commerce notes on appeal,during the remand proceedings,commerce gathered more information about the relationship between cbcc and brasil,but not with regard to the relationship between cbcc or brasil and solvay.thus,the record in the remand is deficient because commerce could not compare the consolidated statements of solvay with the consolidated statements of brasil.by sharply limiting commerce inquiry,the trial court remand actually prevented commerce from undertaking a fully balanced examination that might have produced more accurate results.
therefore,this court reverses and remands with instructions to require commerce to carry out its statutory duty of accurately assessing general costs consistent with this opinion.
each party shall bear its own costs.
reversed and remanded.
i would affirm the decision of the court of international trade sustaining the department of commerce commerce remand result in which the financial expense of the exporter,companhia brasileira carbureto de calcio cbcc,was calculated based on the combined financial statements of cbcc and its immediate parent,solvay do brasil brasil.in so holding,i would not disturb commerce established practice of using an ultimate parent company fully consolidated financial statement to determine financial expenses of a subsidiary in cases with facts different from this one 
the ultimate issue for commerce to determine is the exporter actual costs of production and sale of the subject merchandise commerce is obligated to rely upon methodologies that reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise.f.in calculating cost of production,commerce must include an amount for selling,general,and administrative expenses based on actual data pertaining to production and sales of the foreign like product by the exporter in question.id.b.here,the issue principally concerns one of the general expenses,financial expenses,the interest expenses on loans.the record in this case shows substantial control by brasil over cbcc financial expenses.however,there is no evidence,much less substantial evidence,that cbcc financial expenses pertaining to production and sale of silicon metal were controlled by or are accurately reflected in the consolidated financial statement of solvay cie solvay,cbcc ultimate corporate parent.thus,i agree with the trial court that actual financial costs incurred by cbcc are better derived by combining the financial expense ratios based on the statements of cbcc and brasil rather than reviewing only the consolidated financial statement of solvay 
as verified by commerce,solvay is a belgian conglomerate of over companies solvay does business on five continents with subsidiaries and affiliates in the automotive,chemical,pharmaceutical,plastics,processing,shipping,and related industries.solvay owns of brasil,which in turn owns of cbcc.cbcc acknowledges that it i
