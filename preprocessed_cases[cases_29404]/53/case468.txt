background 
commerce initiated an antidumping duty administrative review of several manufacturers and exporters of tapered roller bearings from japan in.see initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews and requests for revocation in part.dep t commerce.commerce issued questionnaires to the affected parties,including both ntn and nsk,and based its preliminary determination in part on their responses.commerce preliminary determination was published on september.see tapered roller bearings and parts thereof,finished and unfinished,from japan,and tapered roller bearings,four inches or less in outside diameter,and components thereof,from japan.dep t commerce,preliminary admin.review.
commerce gave the interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results and then issued final results that took those comments into account.see tapered roller bearings and parts thereof,finished and unfinished,from japan,and tapered roller bearings,four inches or less in outside diameter,and components thereof,from japan.dep t commerce january,final admin.review final results.in these results,among other actions,commerce employed cost data in a determining whether foreign like products were merchandise similar to tapered roller bearing models,b calculating the difference in merchandise difmer adjustment for and matches,and c recalculating nsk reported inventory carrying costs,id.at relied on facts available to adjust ntn reported home market billing adjustments,id.at relied on its own sampling of inputs to adjust ntn reported cost of production cop and constructed value cv for those inputs,id.at rejected timken argument that ntn warehousing expenses were incorrectly allocated,id.at and rejected ntn argument that transactions should be excluded from the margin calculations,id.at.
on appeal to the court of international trade,the court affirmed all but the last finding the court held that transactions were not sales because they were not supported by consideration,and therefore could not be included in the calculation of normal value.ntn bearing i,d at.the court remanded for commerce to exclude these transactions from ntn sales database.id.on remand,commerce excluded ntn transactions from the database,but rejected ntn argument that it should also exclude those transactions which were not but for which the gross unit price plus subsequent billing adjustments equaled zero.the court of international trade affirmed.ntn bearing of am.united states,wl.int l trade ntn bearing ii.

standard of review 
with respect to the review of antidumping determinations made by commerce,we apply the same standard of review as the court of international trade commerce final determination is reviewed for substantial evidence on the record and for errors of law.b b i micron,united states.
use of affiliated supplier cost data and f 
in the course of its administrative review,commerce requested that nsk provide cost data for major inputs received from affiliated parties and used to produce the tapered roller bearings that were the subject of the review.nsk duly provided the data,but protested commerce request on the ground that f permits commerce to request such data only where it has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that an amount represented as the value of a major input is less than the cost of production of such input,f,and commerce had no such reasonable grounds.commerce noted that it had found home market sales below the cost of production cop in its most recently completed final results for nsk,and conducted a cost test to determine if any of nsk home market sales in this review were similarly below cop.based on the result of this test,commerce used nsk affiliated supplier cost data to recalculate nsk total cost of manufacturing tcom,which the agency then used to recalculate nsk inventory carrying costs in the united states.commerce also employed the recalculated tcom data in determining the difmer adjustment.the agency used this value,which represents differences in physical characteristics between merchandise sold in the united states and that sold abroad,see a,to control which and home market tapered roller bearings would be compared commerce used a percent difmer cost deviation cap as the maximum difference in cost allowable for similar merchandise.
nsk challenges commerce use of the affiliated supplier cost data to calculate these variables.in particular,nsk argues that commerce violated f,which permits the use of these data for purposes of subsections b and e.those provisions relate to the calculation of cop and cv,respectively.citing fag italia,united states,nsk argues that the grant of authority to commerce to use these data for cop and cv calculations implies that commerce does not have the authority to use the data for other purposes.we disagree.
section f is entitled s pecial rules for calculation of cost of production and for calculation of constructed value.nsk sees in this,together with the reference to purposes of subsections b and e in the statutory text,confirmation that congress intended the use of affiliated supplier cost data to be limited to these two purposes.the statute does not,however,contain words of restriction limiting the data use solely to the calculation of cop and cv.nsk thus relies in essence on the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius arguing that the expression of subsections b and e in section f permits an inference that congress intended to preclude use of affiliated supplier cost data for any other purpose.
in focusing exclusively on section f to the exclusion of the other statutory provisions governing commerce actions,nsk stretches this maxim too far.the maxim is not applied where,inter alia,its application would thwart the legislative intent made apparent by the entire act.norman singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction ed.we believe that such is the case here.
commerce calculation of the adjustments at issue in this case is governed only secondarily by section f the agency authority derives directly from other statutory provisions.similar merchandise,or foreign like products in the terms of the statute,is defined by b ii as merchandise like the subject merchandise in component material or materials and in the purposes for which used.commerce is required to determine what merchandise is a foreign like product for purposes of,inter alia,determining normal value.see a b i defining normal value as the price at which the foreign like product is first sold.similarly,commerce derives its authority to calculate a difmer adjustment from a,and derives its authority to account for inventory carrying costs from d.because these statutes provide authority to commerce to calculate the values in question,we look to the text of these statutes in the first instance for congress intent as to how the values are to be calculated.none of these provisions preclude commerce use of affiliated supplier cost data in the calculation of these values.nsk reliance on a maxim of dubious applicability to interpolate restrictions on the use of affiliated supplier cost data into statutes that are silent on the question is unconvincing.
nor is fag italia dispositive in this situation.that case involved a statutory grant of authority to commerce to conduct duty absorption inquiries during any review initiated years or years after the publication of an antidumping duty order.a.commerce
