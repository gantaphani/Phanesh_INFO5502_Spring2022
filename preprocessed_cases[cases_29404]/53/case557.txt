penal code section section bans the import of products made from certain animals,including kangaroos into california.defendants import and sell in california markets athletic shoes made from kangaroo leather.plaintiffs sued defendants for injunctive and declaratory relief,claiming that defendants import the kangaroo leather in violation of section thus are committing an unlawful business practice bus,et.
defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that section is preempted by federal law under the doctrine of conflict preemption.the trial court agreed and granted the motion.we conclude that section is preempted when applied to the facts of this case.the statute as applied to defendants in this case conflicts with federal law and with substantial federal objectives of persuading australian federal and state governments to impose kangaroo population management programs,in exchange for allowing the importation of kangaroo products.accordingly,we affirm.
the material facts are undisputed 
defendants adidas promotional retail operations,sport chalet,and offside soccer are california retailers that sell athletic shoes made from kangaroo leather imported from australia.specifically,defendants sell athletic shoes made from the hides of three kangaroo species the red kangaroo macropus rufus,the eastern gray kangaroo macropus giganteus,and the western gray kangaroo macropus fuliginosus.kangaroos are indigenous to australia,and are not native to california 
plaintiff viva international voice for animals is an international nonprofit organization devoted to protecting animals,including those killed for food its national headquarters is in yolo county.plaintiff jerold friedman is a resident of los angeles county.plaintiffs sued defendants for engaging in an unlawful business practice by importing and selling athletic shoes made from kangaroo leather.plaintiffs alleged the importation and sale of defendants shoes violated section.
section was enacted in,and expanded to include kangaroos in subdivision a of section provides,as here pertinent,that 
it is unlawful to import into this state for commercial purposes,to possess with intent to sell,or to sell within the state,the dead body,or any part or product thereof,of any alligator,crocodile,polar bear,leopard,ocelot,tiger,cheetah,jaguar,sable antelope,wolf canis lupus,zebra,whale,cobra,python,sea turtle,colobus monkey,kangaroo,vicuna,sea otter,feral horse,dolphin or porpoise delphinidae,spanish lynx,or elephant.italics added.
each side filed successive summary judgment motions.first,plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the ground that defendants were violating section and therefore committing an unlawful business practice subject to injunction.after briefing and oral argument,the trial court denied plaintiffs motion on the ground that section is preempted by federal law under the doctrine of conflict preemption.
defendants then moved for a defense summary judgment on three primary grounds as a matter of statutory interpretation,section did not apply here because it is limited to species currently listed as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act esa et,and the three kangaroo species are not currently listed given the history of federal involvement with australian state and federal governments regarding kangaroo population management,section was preempted on the theory of conflict preemption and section violated the commerce clause.
defendants supported their conflict preemption argument with the following undisputed facts regarding the historical role of the federal government in australian kangaroo management practices.many of these facts come from a historical overview entered in the federal register,and included in the record below.fish and wildlife service,endangered and threatened wildlife and plants removal of three kangaroos from the list of endangered and threatened wildlife.et.see footnote,ante.
a commercial market developed in australia for kangaroo hides and meat by the early the kangaroo population had dropped to the point that the australian government instituted protective measures such as a ban on exports and quotas on the killing of kangaroos for commercial use.
congress enacted esa in.congress made several findings,including that various species of fish,wildlife and plants in the united states had been rendered extinct or threatened with extinction.a.congress also found that the united states has pledged itself as a sovereign state in the international community to conserve to the extent practicable the various species of fish or wildlife and plants facing extinction,pursuant to numerous listed international treaties,conventions,and agreements.a.
congress also affirmatively stated that the purposes of esa were to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved,to provide a program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species,and to take such steps as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of the international treaties and conventions set forth in section a.b.
on december,the united states fish and wildlife service fish wildlife listed the red,eastern gray,and western gray kangaroo as threatened species under esa et.such a listing prohibits importation of the species,subject to esa exemptions or permits.a a.fish wildlife formally banned commercial importation of the three kangaroo species,as well as their body parts and products made from the bodies of the species.
fish wildlife accompanied the listing with a special rule that would allow commercial importation into the united states after development of adequate management plans by the four australian states that commercially harvest the three kangaroo species.however,the import ban was to continue until the australian states could assure the united states that they had effective management plans for the kangaroos,and that taking would not be detrimental to the survival of kangaroos.
the kangaroo population began to recover in the.in april,fish wildlife accepted the kangaroo management plans of the four australian states and lifted the import ban after kangaroo management plans and population survey techniques had been strengthened.
in may,fish wildlife issued a final rule lifting the ban on commercial importation into the united states of products made from the red,eastern gray,and western gray kangaroo.
in april,fish wildlife posted two notices in the federal register in which it proposed delisting the three kangaroo species and continuing commercial importation of kangaroo products and body parts.in august,fish wildlife published a final rule allowing the continuation of commercial importation.
on april,fish wildlife received new data from the australian government showing that the severe drought of the summer of had significantly depleted the populations of the three kangaroo species.as a result,fish wildlife withdrew its proposal to delist the three species.
fish wildlife noted that after the drought broke in the winter of,the three species resumed breeding but the ability of kangaroo populations to recover from the major population fluctuation was unknown.fish wildlife further noted that the delisting action could be reconsidered after fish wildlife had a better understanding of how kangaroo populations recover from drought events.
in december,greenpeace usa and other groups petitioned fish wildlife to reinstate the ban on importing the three kangaroo species and their body parts and products.the petitioners argued that australia kangaroo management was inherently flawed and that australian states did not have adequate and effective conservation programs that ensured the protection of the threatened species.
in response to the petition,fish wildlife sent a team of three representatives to australia in march to investigate the population status of the three kangaroo survey methods,numbers,and to investigate the implementation of management programs.the fish wildlife team spent days meeting with members of the australian parliament,scientists,australian state and federal natural resource managers,representatives of nongovernmental organizations,enforcement personnel,farmers,and ranchers.
in june,the fish wildlife team presented its report.fish wildlife opened a comment period until november.the wildlife legislative fund of america fund petitioned fish wildlife to remove the three kangaroo species from the esa list of threatened species.relying on the team report,the fund stressed two grounds to delist the species by conservative estimates the population of the three species totaled almost million and the fact that kangaroo conservation programs exist within individual range states.
fish wildlife requested further comment through the fall of.in january,fish wildlife published a proposed rule to delist the three kangaroo species.fish wildlife found that the four australian states had developed and implemented adequate and effective conservation programs that ensured the protection of these species.fish wildlife also found that the populations of the species were high,and that the three species were protected by appropriate legislation,had their populations regularly monitored by direct and indirect procedures,and were managed by a complex licensing system which regulated the extent of the legal harvest.
in march,fish wildlife removed the three kangaroo species from the list of endangered or threatened species under esa.fish wildlife characterized the red,eastern gray,and western gray populations as abundant.the delisting was accompanied by a plan of monitoring of the species populations for five years,and the proviso for emergency relisting if a significant threat arose to the species.fish wildlife can invoke emergency listing procedures at any time,including after the expiration of the monitoring period,in response to a significant threat to the well being sic of any of the three species.
today,the australian government permits the commercial use of kangaroos and the exportation of kangaroo leather and meat,subject to quotas and other government regulation the parties agree that,since the three species have been delisted under esa,their importation into the united states is not prohibited by federal law.see a a banning importation of listed species.
the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment.the court rejected defendants argument that section only applies to endangered species.but the court ruled that federal law preempted section under the doctrine of conflict preemption.the court did not reach defendants commerce clause claim.
ii.discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.merrill navegar,cal th,d.the primary issues before us are not factual but legal.plaintiffs contend that the trial court correctly interpreted section to apply to all species of kangaroo,not just endangered ones the trial court erred by finding federal preemption and section does not violate the commerce clause.
statutory interpretation 
we first resolve the issue of statutory interpretation urged by defendants below as a ground for summary judgment.defendants argue that section does not even apply here.they claim the statute applies only to species listed as endangered under esa because the red,eastern gray,and western gray kangaroos are no longer so listed,defendants argue that section is inapplicable and can afford plaintiffs no basis for a claim of unlawful business practices arising from defendants importation of shoes made from kangaroo leather.
we disagree because by its plain terms,section applies to the products of any kangaroo nothing in the language of section qualifies any by limiting the statute scope to those kangaroos listed by the federal government as endangered.
the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.irvine th,d.to determine the intent of legislation,we first consult the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.citations.dafonte,cal th,d.when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,and courts should not indulge in it.solberg superior court cal d.where the statutory wording is clear a court should not add to or alter it to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history,supra,th at,d.furthermore,statutory language must be viewed in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,quoting johnstone richardson d.
section is plain and unambiguous.the statute is an outright ban on the importing of the bodies,body parts,or products of certain listed the kangaroo.because the statutory language is clear,we need in fact,should the statute legislative history.delaney superior court cal d,see white ultramar,cal th,d,white.but defendants try to rely on legislative history to show the legislature intended the statute to apply to endangered species.we do not so read the history of section.
it is true that much of the legislative history refers to the statute purpose to protect endangered species.however,the legislature used that term in its broad general sense and not an one.the legislature determined that the species listed in section were in fact endangered,without regard to the federal government legal classification of endangerment.
that is exactly the point made by the author of senate bill,which became section and a companion statute,section.in a written statement,senator anthony beilenson said that section in effect duplicated federal law,the predecessor of esa while section establish es our own list of species that may or may not be covered eventually by the federal act,but which are now in danger of imminent extinction and are animals from which products are made,and are now being sold in this state.emphasis in original.
sections and were enacted at the same time.the former refers to any listed species,while the latter expressly protects species listed as endangered under federal law.the distinction between the two statutes is telling and supports our conclusion 
defendants claim a decision of the court of appeal and a opinion of the attorney general support their position that section applies only to endangered species.we disagree for the following reasons.
people sakai d.sakai involved section ban on the importation of whale products,specifically canned whale meat.but sakai decided only that section was a valid exercise of the state police power and did not constitute a deprivation of property without due process.sakai,supra,at.in upholding the state police power to protect the environment and certain species of wildlife,the court discussed endangered species in generic terms and noted the tenor of recent environmental public interest legislation,including esa.sakai,supra,at.nothing in the opinion purports to erase the distinction between factually endangered species and species legally classified as endangered.section is not limited to the latter.
involved the question whether the term python in section included anaconda.it mentions in passing that section was enacted to protect endangered species,supra,at.but it also notes the legislative objective of section is to protect certain threatened creatures,supra,at.nothing in the attorney general opinion supports the argument that section is limited to species listed under federal law.indeed,the attorney general points out that section incorporat es provisions of federal law,supra,at,fn.
we conclude the trial court correctly interpreted section,which unambiguously applies to any of the listed is not limited to federally listed endangered species.
conflict preemption 
section applies here.the next question is whether the statute is preempted by federal law.
the doctrine of federal preemption is grounded in the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,art.vi,cl.see crosby national foreign trade council,d crosby jevne superior court cal th,d,jevne.there are three types of federal preemption express,implied,and conflict.crosby,supra,at.jevne,supra,at,d,see bronco wine,supra,cal th at,d.
express preemption exists when congress shows its intent to preempt state l
