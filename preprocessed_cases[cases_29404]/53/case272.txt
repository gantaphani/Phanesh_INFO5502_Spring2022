in this consolidated countervailing duty case,the court of international trade trade court ordered the department of commerce commerce not to impose countervailing duties on goods from china,a economy nme country.see gpx int l tire united states gpx iii,wl.int l trade.the trade court held that commerce interpretation of countervailing duty law as permitting the imposition of such duties was unreasonable because of the high likelihood of double counting when both countervailing duties and antidumping duties are assessed against goods from nme countries.gpx int l tire united states gpx i,d.int l trade.we affirm,but on a different ground we find that when amending and reenacting countervailing duty law in and,congress legislatively ratified earlier consistent administrative and judicial interpretations that government payments can not be characterized as subsidies in a economy context,and thus that countervailing duty law does not apply to nme countries.
background 
the tariff act of,as amended,provides for two types of duties on imports that injure domestic industries first,congress has imposed antidumping duties on goods sold in the united states at less than fair value.second,countervailing duties are imposed on goods that receive a countervailable subsidy from a foreign government.id.a.antidumping duties are thus directed to the exporter,while countervailing duties remedy government conduct.this case involves an alleged domestic subsidy,where the subsidy benefits both domestic and exported goods,as opposed to an export subsidy,which benefits only exports.see id.in the case of goods exported from market economy countries countries,both antidumping and countervailing duties may be imposed.the question here is whether both duties may be imposed on goods from nme countries.
while the countervailing duty law makes no references to nmes,the antidumping law deals directly with the problem of exports from nme countries.for goods exported by a typical market economy country,the antidumping duty equals the goods price in the united states the export price or constructed export price minus their price in the exporting country the normal value.see id.in a nonmarket economy country,however,local prices can not be used to calculate the normal value because,by definition,sales of merchandise in such country do not reflect the fair value of the merchandise.id.a.instead,commerce may estimate the normal value based on data from appropriate market economy countries id.c.
because normal values calculated from surrogate countries do not reflect domestic subsidies,the result potentially is that the normal value calculation may be higher than the actual sale price in the nme country.on the other side of the equation,export price is generally unaffected by the fact that an nme country is involved.while the statute provides that countervailing duties imposed on exported goods shall be added to the export price,domestic subsidies do not affect the calculation of export price the overall result is arguably the imposition of a higher dumping margin for nme countries as the result of failure to take account of domestic subsidies.it is urged that if countervailing duties are also imposed for nme countries,the subsidy would be double counted.
as discussed in greater detail below,commerce apparently first considered whether to impose countervailing duties on goods from nme countries in.in,georgetown steel and other american manufacturers petitioned commerce to impose countervailing duties on imports from an nme czechoslovakia,and in,commerce determined that countervailing duty law did not apply to nmes.carbon steel wire rod from czechoslovakia final negative countervailing duty determination wire rod,fed.reg,may.the american manufacturers appealed and succeeded in the trade court.cont l steel united states.int l tr.commerce appealed to our court,arguing that a subsidy is a device used by governments to distort the signals that the market gives to firms,and that by definition,subsidies do not exist in nmes.brief for appellant at,georgetown steel united states,georgetown steel brief.this court ultimately reinstated commerce decision in georgetown steel united states,at.
commerce continued to maintain that countervailing duty law did not apply in a context until,when it issued a memorandum stating that it could apply countervailing duties to merchandise from china,an nme country see countervailing duty investigation of coated free sheet paper from the people republic of china whether the analytical elements of the georgetown steel opinion are applicable to china present day economy,available at georgetown steel memo.the georgetown steel memo did not address the statutory text or legislative history of countervailing duty law rather,it examined the details of china economy and determined that while china remains an nme for purposes of the antidumping law,it was significantly different from the economies at issue in georgetown steel,and that these differences enabled commerce to calculate whether the government subsidized specific goods.id.at.
after commerce issued the georgetown steel memo,in june tire manufacturer titan tire petitioned that commerce impose both antidumping duties and countervailing duties on certain chinese tires,including those manufactured by hebei starbright tire owned by gpx international tire and tianjin united tire rubber international tutric.see gpx i,d at.in,commerce issued both its order imposing countervailing duties,see certain new pneumatic off the road tires from the people republic of china countervailing duty order,fed.reg,and its order imposing antidumping duties,see certain new pneumatic off the road tires from the people republic of china notice of amended final affirmative determination of sales at less than fair value and antidumping duty order,fed.reg.seven complaints were filed to contest commerce antidumping and countervailing duty determinations,which were consolidated by the trade court.see gpx i,d at.
in gpx i,the trade court found that it could not say from the statutory language alone that commerce does not have the authority to impose countervailing duties on products from an country,but that commerce interpretation of the nme antidumping duty statute in relation to the countervailing duty statute was unreasonable.id.at.because the nme antidumping statute was designed to account for government intervention in an nme country economy,including resulting price distortion,the court found that imposing both antidumping duties and countervailing duties could very well result in a double remedy.id.at.this double counting could occur when commerce imposed countervailing duties to offset a domestic subsidy but then calculated antidumping duties by comparing the subsidized export price with a normal value based on estimates from surrogate countries.see id.at commerce disputed that domestic subsidies had a significant effect on export prices,but the trade court found it unreasonable for commerce to put the burden to demonstrate double counting on foreign manufacturers.see id.at.the court remanded with instructions for commerce to forego the imposition of countervailing duties on the merchandise at issue or to adopt additional policies and procedures to account for the imposition of countervailing duty remedies.id.at 
on remand,commerce decided to offset the countervailing duties against the antidumping duties on the same merchandise to avoid this double counting problem.see gpx int l tire united states gpx ii,d.int l trade.the trade court found this approach unreasonable,both because it rendered the countervailing duty investigation unnecessary because the same remedial price adjustment can otherwise be obtained by merely conducting an nme antidumping investigation and because the offset is inconsistent with,which lists the specific offsets to export price and constructed export price that are permissible,and which does not list offsets for countervailing duties based on domestic subsidies.id.at.in summary,the court held that the offset does not comply with the statute and is also unreasonable due to the expense associated with conducting an additional investigation that is essentially useless.id.the court again remanded to commerce with instructions to not impose countervailing duties.id.at.in response to the court direction,commerce declined to impose countervailing duties under protest,and the trade court entered judgment sustaining this determination.gpx iii,wl,at.

discussion 
the interpretation of the countervailing duty statutes is a question of law,which we review de novo.see brother int l united states.however,if after applying the traditional tools of statutory construction,the statute is ambiguous,statutory interpretations articulated by commerce during its adjudicatory proceedings are entitled to chevron deference.magnola metallurgy,united states,see pesquera mares australes ltda.united states.
the trade court decision barred the imposition of countervailing duties because of the substantial potential for double counting if countervailing duties and antidumping duties were both applied to imports from nmes.gpx ii,d at citing gpx i,d at.this reasoning is problematic both because the extent to which the statute may prohibit double counting is unclear and because commerce has determined that it is far from clear that double counting has in fact occurred.we nonetheless conclude that commerce is barred by the statute from imposing countervailing duties on nme goods.as explained below,the legislative history of the countervailing duty law,and particularly congress repeated reenactment of countervailing duty law while approving the georgetown steel holding,demonstrates that congress adopted commerce position that countervailing duties can not be imposed on nme exports.
commerce primary argument is that the plain statutory language mandating that a countervailing duty shall be imposed requires it to impose countervailing duties when it is able to identify a subsidy,even in an nme country.see commerce br.commerce reply br.we disagree.the text of the relevant statute states that if the administering authority determines that the government of a country is providing,directly or indirectly,a countervailable subsidy,and if the domestic injury requirement is met,then there shall be imposed upon such merchandise a countervailing duty,in addition to any other duty imposed,equal to the amount of the net countervailable subsidy.contrary to commerce argument we do not find the statute to be clear on its face.the statute does not explicitly require the imposition of countervailing duties on goods from nme countries.the question is whether government payments in an nme economy constitute countervailable subsidies within the meaning of the statute.we have indeed previously held that the statute does not compel the imposition of countervailing duties to goods from nme countries because the government payments with respect to such goods are not bounties or grants,or countervailable subsidies in the current terminology georgetown steel,at.
section of the tariff act of,the predecessor to the current countervailing duty law,stated that whenever any country shall pay or bestow,directly or indirectly,any bounty or grant,then there shall be levied in addition to any duties otherwise imposed,a duty equal to the net amount of such bounty or grant.repealed.in georgetown steel we found that the economic incentives and benefits provided by governments in nme countries do not constitute bounties or grants under section,at,that is,countervailable subsidies in the language of the current statute.georgetown steel found no indication that congress intended this law to apply to nme exports,noting that the purpose of countervailing duty law is to offset the unfair competitive advantage that foreign producers would otherwise enjoy from export subsidies,and that i n exports from a nonmarket economy this kind of unfair competition can not exist.at quoting zenith radio united states,d.we stated that e ven if one were to label the incentives provided by nmes to exporting entities as a subsidy,the governments of those nonmarket economies would in effect be subsidizing themselves.id.at.we thus upheld commerce decision not to impose countervailing duties on goods from nme countries.
the bounty or grant language of section involved in georgetown steel was replaced by the current countervailable subsidy language in the uruguay round agreements act,pub,stat.uraa,but congress made clear that this change was not intended to substantively affect the countervailing duty law the uraa statement of administrative action saa,which shall be regarded as an authoritative expression by the united states concerning the interpretation and application of the uraa,d,stated that the definition of subsidy will have the same meaning that administrative practice and courts have ascribed to the term bounty or grant and subsidy under prior versions of the statute and that practices countervailable under the current law will be countervailable under the revised statute,doc,at.thus,georgetown steel is equally applicable to the revised statute 
we would normally be obligated to follow georgetown steel in interpreting the revised statute.however,the government argues that georgetown steel did not independently interpret the statute,but rather afforded chevron deference to commerce interpretation of what the court found to be an ambiguous statute.it urges that once commerce changes its interpretation,the court is required to defer to the new interpretation.see cable telecomm.ass brand x internet,d a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.while georgetown steel could perhaps be interpreted as resting on chevron,the problem is that,even if commerce were correct about georgetown steel,congress thereafter ratified the prevailing interpretation by amending and reenacting the countervailing duty statute in and,thereby requiring that we construe the statute as barring countervailing duties in the nme context.
the principle of legislative ratification is well established.in the case of a widely known judicial decision or agency practice,congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change.lorillard pons,d see,forest grove sch.dist,d faragher city of boca raton,d.even where the legislative history does not explicitly reference a prior interpretation,the supreme court has often found that congress has ratified lower court and agency interpretations through statutory reenactment.see,jerman carlisle,mcnellie,rini,kramer ulrich lpa,d commodity futures trading comm schor,d herman maclean huddleston,d merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,curran,d.
there is a stronger presumption of ratification where the legislative history demonstrates that congress was indeed well aware of the prior interpretation.lindahl opm,d.the issue in lindahl was whether a statute barred judicial review of certain merit systems protection board judgments,and the supreme court noted that the legislative history of a amendment to the statute specifically referred to the scroggins standard,which allowed a limited review.id.at.citing scroggins united states.the court stated that i f congress had intended by the amendment to abolish the scroggins standard there would presumably be some indication in the legislative history to this effect.id.at.similarly,in disabled american veterans secretary of veterans affairs,we held that a senate report reference to a board of veterans appeals practice during enactment of the relevant statute indicated an implied adoption of the agency practice.
once congress has ratified a statutory interpretation through reenactment,agencies no longer have discretion to change this interpretation.for example,in fda brown williamson tobacco,d,the fda went through rulemaking to conclude that it had jurisdiction to regulate cigarettes under the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,contrary to its longstanding position.the supreme court held that congress had ratified the fda prior position that it lacked jurisdiction,and thus that the fda could not change its interpretation.the court noted that,in adopting legislation addressing tobacco use over the previous decades,
congress has acted against the backdrop of the fda consistent and repeated statements that it lacked authority under the fdca to regulate tobacco in fact,congress considered and rejected bills that would have granted the fda such jurisdiction.under these circumstances,it is evident that congress statutes have effectively ratified the fda position that it lacks jurisdiction under the fdca to regulate tobacco products.
id.at.in finding legislative ratification,the court emphasized congress specific awareness of the fda position,as evidenced by the fda testifying to its lack of jurisdiction during congressional hearings,and congress rejection of proposals that would have given it this authority.id.at.similarly,in commissioner engle,d,the court did not permit the commissioner to choose among reasonable interpretations of the internal revenue code because in that case,congress had adopted prior judicial interpretations when reenacting the code.
in the present context,even before the legislation,there was a significant argument for legislative ratification.as discussed above,commerce first considered imposing countervailing duties on nme imports in,when a countervailing duty subsidy was called a bounty or grant,repealed.in,commerce determined that a bounty or grant,within the meaning of the countervailing duty law,can not be found in an nme because the notion of a subsidy is,by definition,a market phenomenon.wire rod,fed.reg.at.
commerce described this decision to congress in a hearing on trade remedies,noting that i n final decisions in czech and polish wire rod cases last week,we concluded that bounties or grants within the meaning of the countervailing duty law can not be applied to nme.nonmarket economy imports legislation hearing before the subcomm.on int l trade of the comm.on,cong.may,statement of lionel olmer,undersecretary for int l trade,dep t of commerce.congress enacted other changes to the trade laws in the trade and tariff act of,pub,stat,but rejected provisions that would have affected trade remedies on nme imports,cong.rec.in explaining the p resent law on nme imports,the conference noted that the department of commerce has determined that the countervailing duty laws can not be applied to nonmarket economy imports and that t his decision is pending judicial resolution,referring to the georgetown steel case.id.congress was thus well aware of commerce interpretation that countervailing duties could not be imposed on nme imports,and when reenacting the trade law,it rejected amendments designed to alter that approach.
commerce itself argued in its georgetown steel brief that the legislative history demonstrated congressional ratification of and acquiescence in commerce interpretation.georgetown steel brief at.describing the congressional events of,commerce urged that it was clear that congress considered commerce construction of the countervailing duty law,but took no steps to revise or repeal it,and argued that this congressional acquiescence is persuasive evidence that the construction is the one intended by congress.id.at.while our decision in georgetown steel did not explicitly adopt commerce ratification argument,we relied on the fact that recent actions of congress in dealing with the problem of exports by nonmarket economies showed no indication in any of those statutes,or their legislative history,that congress intended or understood that the countervailing duty law would apply.at.
whether or not congress actions in amounted to legislative ratification,as commerce argued in georgetown steel,its actions in and clearly did.in,congress passed the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of,cong.although this act was vetoed,the legislative history is relevant because it was explicitly incorporated into the revised trade bill that was then enacted,as discussed below.section of the house bill had attempted to supersede georgetown steel by adopting a provision that the countervailing duty laws apply with respect to any economy country to the extent that the administering authority can reasonably identify,and determine the amount of,a subsidy provided by that country,cong.rec.as passed by house.this provision was proposed in direct response to georgetown steel,as indicated by the house committee report 
in a recent court case the federal circuit upheld the department of commerce refusal to apply the countervailing duty law in two investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from poland and czechoslovakia,by holding that the countervailing duty law does not apply to economy countries.georgetown steel united states.

this legislative history indicates that congress was well aware of georgetown steel and that it rejected a statutory provision to supersede it a provision that made the same distinction commerce now proposes.congress description of georgetown steel was more than a passing reference that was inserted into the congressional record by a single senator,mclaughlin richland shoe,d,and the rejected section was proposed in direct response to the georgetown steel decision section was rejected in the course of enacting alternative legislation,and the conference committee specifically described georgetown steel as the p resent law.congress rejection of the very language that would have achieved the result the government urges here weighs heavily against the government interpretation.hamdan rumsfeld,d see also ins cardoza fonseca,d.just as the rejected proposals in hamdan were persuasive evidence that congress did not wish to confer the claimed authority,the legislative history of the trade laws is persuasive evidence that congress did not wish to alter existing law to apply countervailing duties to imports from nmes.see also fda brown williamson tobacco,at.relying on the enactment of legislation against the backdrop of rejected proposals to confer jurisdiction on the fda.
