appellants appeal a decision of the court of international trade that affirmed a department of commerce determination to select thailand as the surrogate country for china in the second administrative review of an antidumping duty order on certain steel threaded rod from china we hold that the department of commerce decision to use surrogate values from thailand to value certain factors of production in calculating normal value for the subject merchandise was in accordance with law,not arbitrary or capricious,and supported by substantial evidence.we affirm.
background 
appellants are jiaxing brother fastener,aka jiaxing brother standard parts,ifi morgan,and rmb fasteners collectively,appellants or jiaxing.jiaxing brother fastener,is a chinese manufacturer of steel threaded rod,while ifi morgan and rmb fasteners are chinese exporters of the steel threaded rod produced by jiaxing brother fastener.appellants are affiliated parties.appellants challenge the department of commerce commerce decision to select thailand as the surrogate country to establish normal value in the second administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain steel threaded rod from china.see certain steel threaded rod from the people republic of china notice of antidumping duty order.dep t of commerce.
in antidumping proceedings involving nonmarket economy countries,such as china,the tariff act requires commerce to calculate normal value of the subject merchandise based on surrogate values offered in a comparable market economy.see c.commerce calculates the surrogate values by valuing certain factors of production used in producing the merchandise in a comparable market economy id.c.in essence,commerce seeks to construct a hypothetical normal value for the merchandise that is uninfluenced by the nonmarket economy.see nation ford chem.united states,see also a defining nonmarket economy country.to do this,commerce selects a market economy country as the primary surrogate country.c.the process of choosing a market economy country to value the factors of production is known as surrogate country selection.see dorbest united states.
as early as,commerce has followed a process to select a surrogate country 
the office of policy op assembles a list of potential surrogate countries that are at a comparable level of economic development to the economy country commerce identifies countries from the list with producers of comparable merchandise commerce determines whether any of the countries which produce comparable merchandise are significant producers of that comparable merchandise and if more than one country satisfies steps,commerce will select the country with the best factors data.

the statute directs commerce to value the factors of production through the best available information in the market economy.c.we have noted that commerce has discretion to determine what constitutes the best available information,as this term is not defined by statute.qvd food united states.commerce generally selects,to the extent practicable,surrogate values that are publicly available,are,reflect a broad market average,and are contemporaneous with the period of review.qingdao sea line trading united states.
using the best available information,commerce shall value the factors of production to the extent possible in one or more market economy countries that are a at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country,and b significant producers of comparable merchandise.c a b emphases added.the statute does not define comparable nor does it require commerce to use any particular methodology in determining which countries are sufficiently comparable.to partially fill the statutory gap,commerce promulgated b,which emphasizes per capita gross domestic product gdp as a measure of economic comparability 
in determining whether a country is at a level of economic development comparable to the economy under c b or c a of the act,the secretary will place primary emphasis on per capita gdp as the measure of economic comparability.
at least by,commerce began relying on per capita gross national income gni,as opposed to per capita gdp,for determining sufficiently comparable countries.according to commerce,while the two measures are very similar,per capita gni is reported across almost all countries by an authoritative source the world bank,and commerce believes that the per capita gni represents the single best measure of a country level of total income and thus level of economic development.vinh hoan,d at quoting antidumping methodologies in proceedings involving non market economy countries surrogate country selection and separate rates,dep t of commerce.
following its preference to use one surrogate country as the reference point,c,when several countries are both at a level of economic development comparable to the nonmarket economy country and significant producers of comparable merchandise,commerce evaluates the reliability and completeness of the data in the surrogate countries and generally selects the one with the best data as the primary surrogate country 
in april,commerce instituted the underlying antidumping duty investigation on certain steel threaded rod from china in april,commerce made a final affirmative determination that a industry was materially injured by sales at value of the merchandise subject to the scope of the investigation in,commerce issued an antidumping duty order on the subject merchandise for purposes of both the preliminary and final determinations,commerce selected india as the surrogate country on which to base the chinese producers factors of production appellants were respondents in the investigation and were assigned antidumping duty rates of 
the second administrative review 
on may,commerce initiated a second administrative review for the period of review from april,though march,the second administrative review is the subject of this appeal.
at the outset of the second administrative review,commerce proposed seven countries as potential surrogate countries on the basis that they had a per capita gni close to china 
with a per capita gni of,india was not included on the list.
after publishing the list of surrogate country candidates,commerce invited interested parties to comment on the selection of an appropriate surrogate country for china vulcan threaded products,vulcan submitted data from thailand,arguing that thailand was the best choice.jiaxing urged commerce to use india as the surrogate country.of the additional countries proposed by other parties,none were within the per capita gni range noted on the list.
in its april preliminary decision on the second administrative review,commerce selected thailand as the most appropriate market economy to act as the surrogate country to china.commerce evaluated global trade atlas gta data and determined that all countries on the surrogate country list exported significant quantities of steel threaded rod and could be considered significant producers of comparable merchandise.after considering the reliability and availability of surrogate value data,commerce chose thailand as the primary surrogate country because the thai information on record was complete,allowing commerce to value material inputs,energy,movement expenses,and financial ratios.to value financial ratios,commerce used the annual report of the thai company capital engineering network public company limited cen.to value the steel and hydrochloric acid hcl inputs,commerce used thai gta import statistics.commerce did not consider india as a surrogate country because the indian data was less economically comparable to china than the thai data.
following the preliminary decision,jiaxing submitted briefing,arguing that commerce should use india as the primary surrogate country,with the philippines as an alternative to india.
on november,commerce published the final results of the second administrative review,selecting thailand as the surrogate country.commerce again explained that india per capita gni was not at a level of economic development comparable to china.as between thailand and the philippines,observing that both countries were significant producers of comparable merchandise,commerce determined that the thai data was the best available information on record.commerce explained that the cost of steel wire rod was the factor with the greatest significance and impact on normal value.according to commerce,the thai information was the most specific data available for this critical factor.
procedural history 
on november,jiaxing appealed the final results to the court of international trade trade court,arguing that commerce erred in selecting thailand as the primary surrogate country over india and the philippines.
on february,the trade court affirmed commerce exclusion of india as a potential surrogate country,but remanded for clarification on the basis for selecting thailand as the surrogate country.jiaxing brother fastener united states jiaxing i,d.int l trade.the trade court found that india did not satisfy commerce requirements for economic comparability.id.at.comparing india per capita gni of against china per capita gni of,the trade court concluded that it is difficult to envision how india would have been a reasonable or defensible choice on this administrative record.id.at.taken together,commerce only real choice was not between india and thailand,but between thailand and the philippines.id.at.the trade court remanded for reconsideration of commerce selection of thailand over the philippines.id.at.although the trade court found the thai data apparently more specific,the trade court determined that commerce had not adequately explained whether the more specific thai input data on steel outweighed the apparent comparative strengths of the philippine data on financial statements and hcl.id.at.the trade court further instructed commerce to reassess its preference for using a single surrogate country to source all data to calculate normal value.id.
on may,commerce again found on remand that thailand offered superior data for calculating normal value.commerce observed that both the philippines and thailand offered financial statements that met its administrative requirements.commerce also found that both the philippine and thai data for hcl were specific,contemporaneous,and reliable.noting the parity between the two candidate countries,commerce emphasized the importance of steel wire rod 
given that steel threaded rod is a type of steel fastener drawn from steel wire rod or steel round bar,in this case,these steel inputs are the most important factors of production to consider in the proper valuation of steel threaded rod.in fact,nearly all manufacturing costs were derived from the main steel inputs,and consist of a large majority of the normal value.
because one input dominated jiaxing factors of production,commerce found that the thai steel data was superior and outweighed any weakness in the thai financial statements or hcl input data.jiaxing appealed commerce remand redetermination.
on september,the trade court affirmed the remand redetermination.jiaxing brother fastener united states jiaxing ii,d.int l trade.the trade court reasoned that the cost of steel wire rod drove almost the entire value of steel threaded rod and that the thai financial information provided by cen was representative of jiaxing financial ratios.id.at.reviewing commerce selection of thailand over the philippines,the trade court determined that the thai import data identified specific grades of steel with varying carbon content that could be matched to the grade of steel used by jiaxing,while the philippine import data provided broader categories that were not as specific.id.at.the thai data also provided values for all factors of production,whereas the philippine data set was missing certain values.id.at.

discussion 
jiaxing argues that commerce choice of thailand as the surrogate country over india and the philippines was erroneous on three distinct grounds first,jiaxing argues that commerce decision to exclude india reflects erroneous interpretations of the antidumping statute and findings not supported by substantial evidence.second,jiaxing contends that the selection of thailand was arbitrary and capricious because india has traditionally served as the surrogate country,and there is no legal basis for commerce to depart from its practice.third,jiaxing asserts that the selection of thailand is not supported by substantial evidence.we take each argument in turn.
commerce decision to exclude india 
we first address whether commerce decision to not consider india as a potential surrogate country is based on a permissible construction of the statute.as noted above,neither party argues that the statute is ambiguous.we therefore are left to determine whether commerce decision to not consider india as a surrogate country or a surrogate country candidate conflicts with the statute express terms.see united states eurodif,d.
we discern nothing in the statute that requires commerce to consider any particular country as a surrogate country.when congress does not mandate a procedure or methodology for applying a statutory test,commerce may perform its duties in the way it believes most suitable.see jbf rak llc united states,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.here,commerce has provided reasoned analysis in support of its surrogate country determination,which we find to be supported by substantial evidence.
commerce selection of thailand over india 
we next consider jiaxing assertion that commerce has a long and established practice of using india as a surrogate country and that its selection of thailand was contrary to law and unsupported by substantial evidence.jiaxing notes that india has been a surrogate country to china for nearly three decades.to suddenly not include india on the list of alternative surrogate countries demonstrates,in jiaxing view,a lack of transparency and an inconsistency with commerce past practices,which in turn causes a lack of predictability for nonmarket respondents.in clearon,jiaxing argues,the trade court remanded for reconsideration of the proper surrogate country because commerce,with no justification,departed from its past practices by not identifying india as a candidate.see clearon united states,bna.trade lexis,at.int l trade july,the need for an agency to adequately address a departure from past practice is a compelling justification for a remand request.according to jiaxing,clearon demonstrates the influential role that india has played over the years as a surrogate to china.we disagree that commerce is forever bound by its past practices.
the record demonstrates that commerce considered jiaxing arguments that favored india,and that its rejection of them during the second administrative review was consistent with the antidumping statute and supported by substantial evidence 
india,though,had a per capita gni of,whereas china had a per capita gni of.given that
