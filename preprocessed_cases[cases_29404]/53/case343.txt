the united states international trade commission itc or commission determined that qualcomm incorporated qualcomm infringed broadcom corporation broadcom united states patent patent with its imports.as a remedy,the itc issued a limited exclusion order leo against the importation of all downstream products containing the accused technology.aside from qualcomm,the appellants in this action are qualcomm customers.some customers are wireless device manufacturers whose products are subject to the leo.others are wireless network operators whose networks depend on products subject to the leo.despite the broad downstream scope of the leo,broadcom named only qualcomm as a respondent in its itc complaint.because the itc correctly construed the critical disputed claim term in broadcom patent,and because the itc correctly rejected qualcomm invalidity arguments under and,this court affirms the itc finding that the patent is not invalid.this court also affirms the itc determination of no direct infringement by qualcomm.however,because the itc misapplied the standard for induced infringement,this court vacates and remands on infringement.finally,because the itc has no statutory authority to issue an leo against downstream products of,this court vacates and remands the limited exclusion order.

one or more circuits adapted for use in a mobile computing device comprising a terminal adapted to receive battery power for at least one of the circuits communication circuitry comprising a reduced power mode and being adapted to use a first wireless communication and a second wireless communication different from the first wireless communication to transmit data to access points,the communication circuitry reducing power by controlling the frequency of scanning for the access points and processing circuitry arranged to process data received from the communication circuitry.
patent claim.in the liability phase at the itc,the parties vigorously contested the interpretation of the phrase a first wireless communication and a second wireless communication different from the first wireless communication.the itc administrative law judge characterized this dispute in terms of how different these wireless communications need to be.in re certain baseband processor chips chipsets,transmitter receiver radio chips,power control chips,prod.containing same,including cellular telephone handsets,inv,wl,itc lexis,at int l trade comm,initial determination.
before the itc,qualcomm argued that different is extremely broad and is not limited to any particular type of difference.the itc concluded qualcomm proposal was too broad and would include any slight difference in wireless communications,without regard to the context of the claim.id.the itc construed the term as refer ring to two different methods of communication.id.at.in this appeal,qualcomm challenges the itc construction as too narrow and argues instead for its originally proffered broad interpretation.
this action began on may,when broadcom filed a complaint in the itc alleging unfair acts in violation of section of the tariff act of,or section.broadcom named qualcomm,and only qualcomm,as a respondent.broadcom alleged that thirteen qualcomm chips and chipsets infringe several broadcom patents.the administrative law judge bifurcated the itc proceedings into separate liability and remedy proceedings.
on liability,the itc determined that qualcomm had not infringed two of broadcom patents patent and.these aspects of the itc rulings were the subject of a separate,recently decided appeal.see broadcom itc.
with regard to the patent,however,the itc determined that qualcomm chips,when programmed to enable certain features,infringe the patent.moreover,the itc found qualcomm liable for inducing third party manufacturers to incorporate software and qualcomm chips into their mobile devices.further,the commission rejected qualcomm anticipation and obviousness arguments under and.
with regard to remedy,the itc issued an leo excluding h andheld wireless communications devices,including cellular telephone handsets and pdas,containing qualcomm baseband processor chips or chipsets that are programmed to enable the power saving features covered by claims,or of patent,wherein the chips or chipsets are manufactured abroad by or on behalf of qualcomm incorporated.in re certain baseband processor chips chipsets,transmitter receiver radio chips,power control chips,prod.containing same,including cellular telephone handsets,inv.int l trade comm june,limited exclusion order.
qualcomm appeals both the liability and remedy findings.kyocera and other wireless device to broadcom itc subject to the leo because they purchase and incorporate qualcomm chips into their mobile wireless devices outside the united states,and then import them into the united states for sale.at t and other wireless network not named as respondents to broadcom networks which depend on devices that include qualcomm chips.this appeal consolidates the several appeals of qualcomm and these manufacturers and carriers.this court has jurisdiction to review itc determinations under a and c.
this court reviews claim construction without deference.cybor fas,en banc.generally this court gives claim terms their ordinary and customary meanings,according to the customary understanding of a person of ordinary skill in the art who reads them in the context of the intrinsic record.see phillips awh,en banc.the specification is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.vitronics conceptronic.this court recognizes,however,there is sometimes a fine line between reading a claim in light of the specification,and reading a limitation into the claim from the specification.comark,harris.
the disputed claim term in this case different appears in the following claim phrase a second wireless communication different from the first.this phrase does not,in and of itself,suggest any limitation on the degree of difference between the two wireless communications.the phrase merely requires that the communications be different,without suggesting any manner or degree of difference.
however,this court does not interpret claim terms in a vacuum,devoid of the context of the claim as a whole.see,converse,proper claim construction demands interpretation of the entire claim in context,not a single element in isolation.actv,walt disney,while certain terms may be at the center of the claim construction debate,the context of the surrounding words of the claim also must be considered.claim requires communication circuitry being adapted to use the two different wireless communications.communications circuitry capable of using a first wireless communication need not be adapted to use a second wireless communication different from the first unless the difference between the first and second communications is somehow significant.in this context,the disputed claim term suggests that the two claimed wireless communications are not merely different in any way,but in such a way that requires adaptations in communication circuitry to facilitate both wireless uses.
with this introduction,this court consults the specification to determine the nature of the potential differences in wireless communications.see,benetton group spa,in most cases,the best source for discerning this proper context is the patent specification wherein the patent applicant describes the invention.in the background section,the inventors explain that the prior art used different communication modules to achieve different methods of communication communications supported by computer modules may include wired connection,such as over phone lines for a modem or through a wired local area network lan,and wireless communication such as a wireless lan,a wide area network wan,or infrared.patent.the number of different communication methods in one device depended on the number of module slots in that computer.therefore,there is a need for a multipurpose computer module that can provide more than one peripheral function and control switching between those functions in a single module.id.
the specification explains further that the invention addresses this need with a portable device adapted to accommodate different communications methods.the invention is a portable data terminal with at least two communication transceivers having different operating characteristics for conducting data communications on different subnetworks.id.the specification supplies examples of different possible operating characteristics of these transceivers narrowband radio frequency,or spread spectrum radio frequency,modem or other wired network communication,infrared,id.moreover,the specification explains that the transceivers included in the invention mobile devices are operable on any number of communication mediums,since the differences in their operating characteristics are isolated from the base module of the mcds by a communication processor.id.thus,the specification consistently teaches that the relevant difference between the two claimed wireless communications is their method of communication.
qualcomm argues that reading different to mean different methods of communication would impermissibly exclude preferred embodiments,specifically the one outlined in figure 
figure and its accompanying description describe the way a mobile communication device mcd can roam between base stations while connected to one or more networks.the mcd communicates with an access point in a structured manner,sending several messages such as messages,data message s,acknowledge signals,and sequences.id.according to qualcomm,these structured messages use the same method of wireless communication.therefore,qualcomm contends,a first wireless communication,a request for poll message and a second wireless communication,a data message do not necessarily mean two methods of wireless communication within the context of the patent.
to the contrary,claim of the patent may require a device capable of using two different wireless communication methods and still fall within the terms of figure.figure describes communication with a device through one access point with just one of those methods.the patent inventors were clear that different access points could employ different communications methods a ccess point provides for communication via one type of radio communication while access point provides for another.for example,access point may provide a digital cellular link while access point provides for local spread spectrum link.patent.further,t he present invention contemplates various combinations of communication technologies,all accommodated by communication modules of mcd.id.
thus,read in the context of the entire specification,figure merely provides exemplary details of a claimed device communicating with a particular access point using a particular method of communication.this figure does not change claim requirement for a device adapted to use two different communications.the specification provides the necessary context for the difference between the claimed first and second wireless communications.the difference envisioned by the claim is a difference in their method of communication.in other words,the itc properly construed the meaning of the term different.
qualcomm also contends that this court construction of the same claim term in sorensen itc,mandates a broad construction of different in this different patent.the patent in sorensen pertained to a method of spacing plastic mold sections during sequential steps of plastic injection molding.id.at.the claim in question required injecting a second plastic material having different characteristics than the first plastic material id.at.this court construed different characteristics to mean any difference in characteristics between the two injected materials,including a difference in color alone.id.at.qualcomm reads that particular holding to create a rule that use of the claim term different without further qualification must mean any difference.
sorensen created no such categorical rule.in sorensen,this court only discerned a broad meaning for the term different after concluding that a the claim term in the context of the entire claim connoted that different implied any difference in characteristics and b the specification and the prosecution history showed no disavowal of claim scope in relation to material characteristics.id.at.this court analysis of the context of this different claim as a whole,as well as the intrinsic record for this different patent,to arrive at the proper context for the term different is thus not inconsistent with sorensen.in sum,the specification and context of the claim term in sorensen did not qualify or limit the nature of the different characteristics of the plastic the specification and context in this case show that the different wireless communications means a difference in the method of communication,not simply any conceivable difference.accordingly,this court sustains the itc determination that different first and second wireless communications refers to two different methods of communication.
qualcomm argues the itc erred by concluding the patent claims are not anticipated by three pieces of prior art patent moore borras and sato.qualcomm does not contest the itc findings that each of moore,borras,and sato discloses communication via a single communication method.thus,qualcomm argument on appeal depends entirely on this court disturbing the itc claim construction in favor of a broader understanding of the word different.
because this court affirms the itc claim construction and rejects qualcomm broader understanding of different in the context of claim of the patent,this court affirms the itc finding that the moore,borras,and sato references do not anticipate under.
qualcomm further appeals the itc finding that a collection of technical specifications known as the global system for mobile communications gsm standard does not anticipate the asserted claims.the gsm standard is a comprehensive set of specifications for a second generation mobile network.the european telecommunications standards institute etsi,an independent standards organization comprised of telecommunications manufacturers and carriers,devised this standard.the standards are technical specifications that describe one aspect of the technology for equipment.
the itc determined qualcomm did not show that the gsm standard was a printed publication under.specifically,qualcomm did not show that the gsm standard was publicly available.in addition,the itc found the gsm standard did not constitute a single prior art reference for purposes of anticipation under.initial determination,itc lexis,at.
whether an asserted anticipatory document qualifies as a printed publication under is a legal conclusion based on underlying factual determinations.cooper cameron kvaerner oilfield.this court reviews the legal conclusion without deference while according substantial evidence deference to the factual components of the determination.see bourdeau,itc.
the printed publication requirement appears in a person shall be entitled to a patent unless b the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states.because there are many ways in which a reference may be disseminated to the interested public,public accessibility has been called the touchstone in determining whether a reference constitutes a printed publication bar under b.in re hall.a reference is publicly accessible upon a satisfactory showing that such document has been disseminated or otherwise made available to the extent that persons interested and ordinarily skilled in the subject matter or art exercising reasonable diligence,can locate it sri int l,internet sec,quoting bruckelmyer ground heaters.this court assesses public accessibility on a basis.in re cronyn.
the itc concluded the gsm standard was not publicly available because it was analogous to the publication in northern telecom,datapoint.in northern telecom,the documents described a complex military system.the company maintaining the documents housed them in a proprietary library with access restricted to persons authorized by the company.id.at.under these circumstances,the document was not sufficiently available to the public.id.at.
in this case,however,the record shows that the gsm reference was not secluded under a similar veil of secrecy.the record shows that gsm specifications,though drafted within smaller technical subcommittees,were widely distributed before the critical date of the patent.versions of the standard were publicly available and released as consistent sets.pautet witness statement.several companies took part in the etsi work and had access to the gsm specifications through their european subsidiaries.the specifications themselves were visible to any member of the interested public without requesting them from an etsi member.further,etsi did not impose restrictions on etsi members to prevent them from disseminating information about the standard to.pautet witness statement.
the itc places inordinate emphasis on the record evidence that archival paper copies of the standard are maintained in a facility.the record does not show,however,that the standard was closed to public access in that manner at the time critical to the invention of the patent claims.to the contrary,the record details the publication in of a page technical book entitled the gsm system for mobile communications,referred to popularly as the gsm bible.this bible sold more than copies with the express purpose of giving wider access to the gsm standard.pautet witness statement.
indeed,the primary purpose of the gsm standard was to develop a system interoperable across national borders.this purpose made it crucial to grant access to any interested parties.etsi broad membership is a testament to the fruition of this purpose.thus,the gsm standard documents do not fall in the same confidential category as the northern telecom documents,which were not authorized for public release and were maintained under a policy of restricted access.because the gsm standard was sufficiently accessible,at least to the public interested in the art,this court finds insubstantial evidence for the itc conclusion that the gsm standard was not publicly available.see in re hall,at.
this court next turns to qualcomm contention that the itc incorrectly found that qualcomm proffered collection of eleven separate gsm specifications does not anticipate the asserted patent claims because the specifications do not together constitute a single reference for purposes.qualcomm argues the different gsm specifications are like chapters of a book and function as a single,coherent reference that is simply too voluminous to bind into one volume.
this court requires that in order to anticipate a claim,a single prior art reference must expressly or inherently disclose each claim limitation.finisar directv group.the record evidence suggests that the gsm standard is not a single reference.the different specifications that comprise the gsm standard were authored by different subsets of authors at different times.indeed,the gsm standard includes hundreds of individual specifications drafted by approximately ten different subgroups,each with its own title and separate page numbering.each specification,though part of the greater gsm standard,stands as a separate document in its own right.even qualcomm one of the most knowledgeable people in the world about the operation of that she had not read the entire standard and did not know of any person who had read the entire standard.open session tr.under these circumstances,the gsm standard is actually several prior art references with separate dates of creation,rather than a single prior art reference.
qualcomm asserts that each gsm specification incorporates the others by reference.even if true,this fact does not qualify the gsm standard as a single reference.this court has been clear that in order for one document to incorporate another document by reference,the incorporating document must identify the incorporated document with detailed particularity,clearly indicating the specific material for incorporation.see advanced display,kent state.at most,each relevant gsm specification identifies itself as a part of the greater gsm standard specifications at times other specifications.this vague referencing practice is hardly sufficient to meet this court legal requirements for incorporation.in sum,the gsm standard is simply not a coherent whole document that can be assigned a single prior art date of creation.
for this reason,as opposed to the secrecy justification,this court affirms the itc determination that the gsm standard is not available for use as a single anticipating reference under.because the gsm standard is not a single reference for an anticipation examination,this court need not reach qualcomm arguments that the gsm standard discloses all the requirements of broadcom asserted claims.
qualcomm final invalidity defense on appeal pertains to obviousness under.the commission rejected qualcomm obviousness arguments,finding that qualcomm waived this defense by failing to raise it in a timely manner.qualcomm now argues it never had the opportunity to present evidence under the proper legal standard because the supreme court decision in ksr int l teleflex,d,was decided after the itc determination of liability.accordingly,qualcomm maintains,this court should now assess obviousness in the light of the supreme court language in ksr.
qualcomm can not invoke intervening supreme court case law to correct its own procedural misstep.as the itc correctly determined,qualcomm did not set forth an obviousness analysis for the independent claims of the patent until after the administrative law judge had made an initial determination.neither qualcomm expert reports nor written testimony contained an obviousness opinion.qualcomm brief was similarly devoid of an obviousness analysis.this court need not engage in an obviousness inquiry when qualcomm did not assert relevant obviousness arguments at the proper time.further,because qualcomm waived the defense of obviousness,this court declines to consider the merits of qualcomm position that broadcom asserted claims are obvious in light of the prior art.see hazani itc,we find no legal error in the administrative law judge determination that the arguments that hazani raised for the first time on reconsideration were untimely and could properly be rejected on that ground alone.
broadcom argued before the itc that qualcomm violated section through both direct and indirect infringement of the patent.as intervenor,broadcom here challenges the itc finding of no direct infringement by qualcomm as an alternative basis on which to sustain the commission order.with regard to indirect infringement,qualcomm appeals the commission finding of inducement.
the commission unambiguously rejected broadcom sole proffer with regard to direct infringement by qualcomm,which was an allegation relating to qualcomm importation and use of certain testing devices known as form factor accurate ffa devices.initial determination,itc lexis,at.
this finding was amply supported by substantial evidence.broadcom own expert did not test any of qualcomm ffas,and broadcom only real evidence regarding infringement by these devices was the testimony of three qualcomm witnesses.id.at.the testimony of these witnesses,grob,proakis,and mollenkopf,did not come close to establishing direct infringement by qualcomm.grob testimony did not make reference to a reduced power mode,and thus could not have established infringement of the asserted claims of the patent,which all require this feature.id.at.with regard to proakis,substantial evidence supports the conclusion that his testimony was inconclusive,because he stated he had no specific knowledge as to how ffa testing was performed.id.at.finally,mollenkopf testimony was equally unenlightening because a he was never personally involved in performing ffa testing,b his recollection was that such testing occurred two years before the patent issued,and c such recollection was still just a guess.mollenkopf dep.in sum,because there was substantial evidence for the commission to conclude that broadcom failed to establish infringement by qualcomm ffa devices,this court affirms the finding of no direct infringement.
qualcomm appeal of the itc finding of induced infringement is squarely before this court.the commission found that the baseband processor chip is representative of thirteen qualcomm chips all with the prefix msm that broadcom alleges infringe the claims.specifically,the commission found that qualcomm msm chips infringe the patent asserted claims when they are programmed with computer source code system determination software that implements features such as reducing the frequency of scanning for network access points.initial determination,itc lexis,at.
for example,the itc found that the chipset scans for an access point for up to fifteen minutes before entering into a search algorithm.if fifteen minutes of searching does not yield an access point,the system determination software directs the chipset to alternate between periods of scanning for an access point and powering down the communication circuitry.such software alleviates the familiar problem of rapid battery drainage that occurs,for example,when a mobile phone is in a network dead spot and continually searches for an access network.
the itc determined that qualcomm handset manufacturer customers directly infringe the patent by making handsets that incorporate the accused msm chipsets and system determination software.the itc further determined that qualcomm induces the infringing acts of its handset manufacturer customers by,inter alia,providing customers with the system determination software,training them on implementation of their mobile devices,providing software and firmware updates,offering customer support,furnishing promotional and technical documents for the accused msm chipsets,and recommending that its customers implement battery saving features.id.
under b,w hoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.to prevail on inducement,the patentee must show,first that there has been direct infringement,and second that the alleged infringer knowingly induced infringement and possessed specific intent to encourage another infringement.mining chemque,citation omitted.in dsu med.jms,this court clarified en banc that the specific intent necessary to induce infringement requires more than just intent to cause the acts that produce direct infringement.beyond that threshold knowledge,the inducer must have an affirmative intent to cause direct infringement,en banc review of intent requirement.
the itc released its initial determination before this court clarification of the intent standard for inducement in dsu.the itc administrative law judge understood federal circuit law to permit a finding of inducement upon a showing of either general or specific level of intent and expressly adopted broadcom argument that the only intent required of the defendant is the intent to cause the acts that constitute infringement.initial determination,itc lexis at.applying this understanding of the law,the commission determined that qualcomm intends to induce infringement because it provides its customers with the system determination code.id.at.
although thought to be proper at the time,the approach adopted by the itc is improper under this court decision in dsu.proof of intent to cause infringing acts is a necessary but not sufficient condition for induced infringement.inducement additionally requires evidence of culpable conduct,directed to encouraging another infringement,specific intent to encourage infringement.dsu,at.this specific intent may,of course,be demonstrated by circumstantial evidence such as that presented by broadcom.id.but the itc conclusion that qualcomm intends to induce infringement because it provides its customers with the system determination code evinces,at most,a finding that qualcomm generally intended to cause acts that produced infringement.thus,the current record falls short of the necessary intent showing for qualcomm possessed a specific intent to cause infringement of broadcom patent.
because the commission based its finding on an approach overruled by dsu,this court vacates and remands the itc determination of induced infringement.on remand,the itc will have the opportunity to examine whether qualcomm conduct satisfies the specific intent requirement set forth in dsu.
under the statutory framework of section,the itc must determine the appropriate remedy for an adjudged violation.between july and,the itc held a hearing in which broadcom,qualcomm,and six intervenors whose participation was limited to the remedy phase presented extensive testimony about proper remedies.because virtually all putatively infringing articles sold for importation or imported into the united states are contained in handsets manufactured by downstream third parties,the commission held a further remedy hearing on march,in which it considered evidence both written and live related to remedy and the public interest.the commission entertained testimony from dozens of witnesses.
on june,the commission issued a lengthy remedy decision setting forth a limited exclusion order.the leo covers both qualcomm baseband processor chips programmed to enable the power saving features covered by claims,or of the patent and handheld wireless devices including cellular phones and personal digital assistants that contain such programmed qualcomm chips and that were not imported for sale before the date of the order.limited exclusion order,inv.at.
on appeal,qualcomm and the appellants argue,inter alia,that the commission exceeded its statutory authority by issuing an leo that excludes imports of downstream manufacturers who were not named as respondents in broadcom initial complaint.according to these appellants,leos may only exclude the products of named parties.broadcom and the commission maintain that the itc has authority to order an leo which excludes all of a respondent articles that are determined to violate,regardless of the identity of the importer.
the itc is a creature of statute,and must find authority for its actions in its enabling statute.see vastfame camera,itc.accordingly,this court must examine the commission authority under d to issue exclusion orders.this court conducts statutory interpretations in accordance with the framework established by chevron natural res.def.council,d.under chevron,a reviewing court must first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.fda brown williamson tobacco,d quoting chevron,at.if congress has done so,the inquiry is at an end the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.quoting chevron,at.however,if the statute in question is ambiguous and the agency interpretation is reasonable,a court must defer to an agency construction of a statute governing agency conduct.cathedral candle itc.
