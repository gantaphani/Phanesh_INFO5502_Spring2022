background 
between june,and march,nitek electronics,nitek entered shipments of pipe fitting components used for gas meters,which included gas meter swivels and gas meter nuts,into the united states from china.customs issued a letter to nitek on april,claiming that the merchandise was misclassified under the harmonized tariff schedule htsus.accordingly,customs demanded payment for lost duties under d that resulted from the alleged misclassification.customs further alleged that the misclassification was also subject to antidumping duties.on march,customs issued a notice to nitek alleging that nitek entered or attempted to enter pipe fittings into the commerce of the united states by means of material false statements and documents,omissions.the notice stated that the tentative culpability was gross negligence.
concurrently,other importers of gas meter swivels and gas meter nuts challenged the antidumping duty order in the court of international trade.see sango int l united states,d.int l trade.customs agreed to stay the penalty proceedings pending resolution of sango international challenge in exchange for nitek subsequently waiving the statute of limitations.this court later issued a final decision in sango international on june,which sustained the duty order.sango int l united states.
on february,customs issued nitek a final penalty claim and again stated that the tentative culpability was gross negligence.nitek responded by letter opposing the penalty claim for gross negligence stating that it had not acted with wanton disregard for the law when dealing with the classification issues.nitek also offered to pay all duties owed.customs then referred the matter to the united states department of justice united states or government to bring a claim against nitek in the court of international trade to enforce the penalty under its jurisdiction in.the united states then brought suit against nitek to recover lost duties,antidumping duties,and a penalty based on negligence under in connection with the nitek misclassification of gas meter parts.
nitek filed a motion to dismiss the case under two theories.first,nitek moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under uscit rule b because the government failed to exhaust all administrative remedies before filing suit in the court of international trade.the court denied dismissal on this ground because it found that exhaustion was not a jurisdictional matter and can be waived.alternatively,nitek moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted under uscit rule b now b.the court denied dismissal of the claims to recover lost duties and antidumping duties.however,the court did dismiss the government claim for a penalty based on negligence.the court reasoned that since customs had only issued a penalty based on gross negligence,the government could not bring a penalty claim in court based on negligence.the negligence claim was an entirely new claim that had not been pursued by customs at the administrative level.thus,the court found that the penalty claim was not properly before the court because the government had failed to exhaust all administrative remedies by not having customs demand a penalty based on negligence,instead of gross negligence.
the government then moved for reconsideration,but the court reaffirmed its reading of the statute and denied reconsideration.the court explained that for the court to have any role,there must exist a claim for a specified violation of a namely,a material false statement or omission amounting to fraud,gross negligence,or negligence for which the government is seeking recovery,thereby limiting the scope of the government action to the administrative claim customs imposed below.
on september,the parties stipulated that the united states is entitled to recover from nitek for the lost duties and antidumping duties.the parties also stipulated that they could not appeal their agreement on these counts.accordingly,the court ordered a final judgment on october,for the united states for the above amount.

the issue in this case is whether the court properly dismissed the government penalty claim for failure to state a claim because the underlying administrative penalty was based on gross negligence,not negligence.this requires a close examination of the statutory scheme in,which governs this penalty claim.
first,a states that no one may enter merchandise into the united states by presenting material and false information by means of fraud,gross negligence,or negligence.a.if customs believes that there has been a violation of subsection a,b provides that customs must first issue a notice to the importer.the notice must specify all laws and regulations allegedly violated and state whether the alleged violation occurred as a result of fraud,gross negligence,or negligence.b a iii,v.customs must also inform the accused importer that he shall have a reasonable opportunity to make representations,both oral and written,as to why a claim for a monetary penalty should not be issued in the amount stated.b a vii.next,if customs determines that there was a violation after considering any representations made by the accused importer,customs must issue a written penalty claim under b.the penalty claim must specify any changes in the information provided in the notice,including the level of culpability that was initially stated.the importer may then follow the procedures under to seek remission or mitigation of the penalty.at the conclusion of any such proceedings,customs shall provide to the person concerned a written statement which sets forth the final determination and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which such determination is based.b.
under e,the united states can bring a claim in the court of international trade for the recovery of any monetary penalty claimed under this section.the statute also states that all issues,including the amount of the penalty,shall be tried de novo,e,and sets out the burden of proof for each culpability level.for fraud,the united states has to prove the violation by clear and convincing evidence.e.for gross negligence,the united states has the burden to prove the elements of the violation.e.for negligence,the united states has the burden to prove the act or omission that caused the violation and the alleged violator has the burden to prove that their actions were not negligent.e.
from the statutory framework,it is clear that e creates a cause of action for the united states to recover penalty claims.subsection b states the procedures that customs must follow when making penalty claims,including specifying the le
