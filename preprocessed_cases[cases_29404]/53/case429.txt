xerox corporation xerox appeals the united states court of international trade decision dismissing xerox protest of the liquidation by the united states customs service customs of goods imported from mexico at the rate indicated by xerox upon entry to be applicable.see xerox united states,slip op,wl,dismissal.the court of international trade determined that liquidation by customs of the goods as entered,rather than at a more preferential rate pursuant to the north american free trade agreement nafta,was not a protestable decision under because the issue of whether the subject merchandise was eligible for the nafta preference was simply never before customs.dismissal,wl at.the court found that xerox protest was therefore invalid and did not give rise to jurisdiction under a.id.at.because xerox did not claim preferential treatment under nafta for its goods at the time of entry,as provided by,or make a claim within a year of entry,as required by d,we agree that the protest was invalid and affirm the court of international trade decision.
in,leaders from the united states,canada and mexico entered into negotiations for the creation of a free trade zone on the north american continent.the resulting agreement,nafta,promotes the free flow of goods between the three signatory countries through a reduction or phased elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade.made in the usa found.united states,cir see also cpc int l,united states,cit recognizing the stated objectives of nafta to eliminate barriers to trade in,and facilitate the movement of goods between the territories of the nafta parties.on december,congress passed the nafta implementation act,wherein it approved nafta and enacted law to effectuate and enforce the provisions of the trade agreement.see,stat codified as amended at.the present case arises from a failed attempt by xerox to claim preferential treatment under nafta and the nafta implementation act for certain entries of electrostatic photocopiers and wire harnesses.
between january and march,xerox imported entries of electrostatic photocopiers and wire harnesses into the united states at the port of entry in laredo,texas.xerox claimed classification of the goods at the ad valorem rate under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus,applicable to entries of photocopiers,and the ad valorem rate of htsus subheading,applicable to entries of wire harnesses.xerox did not claim at entry the preferential,tariff treatment provided by nafta because xerox did not possess the requisite nafta certificates of origin,as required by.on december,and of,and on january,and of,customs liquidated xerox entries as entered,it assessed column normal trade relation duty rates for goods classified under htsus subheadings and.
at some point in time after entry,the mexican exporter of xerox goods issued nafta certificates of origin covering the goods.on march,xerox submitted the certificates to customs and for the first time asserted that its entries were entitled to a preference under nafta in a protest of the liquidation pursuant to a.on november,customs decided upon further review that the subject entries should have been claimed under d,id.at,which allows an importer to file a post importation claim for nafta preference,but only within one year after the date of importation.customs determined that a llowing conversion to a nafta claim only the last entry of march,is timely and will be processed with a refund.id.customs therefore reliquidated that single entry at a more preferential rate under nafta and denied xerox protest as to the remaining entries 
xerox appealed the partial denial of its protest to the court of international trade.customs moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of the absence of a protestable decision by customs to deny xerox nafta treatment.xerox moved for summary judgment,arguing that the filing of a protest under a,even in the absence of an earlier claim for reliquidation under d,is a statutorily authorized method for asserting an importer right to a preferential rate of duty under nafta.
on october,the court of international trade found sections a and d to be complementary statutes addressing different factual circumstances the former is directed towards actual decisions by customs,and the latter applies when no claim for preferential treatment was made upon entry.dismissal at.the court thus framed the question before it as whether customs made a decision to deny xerox nafta preference.answering in the negative,the court determined that the issue of nafta eligibility for xerox entries was never before customs and that customs therefore did not make a protestable decision to deny xerox a preferential nafta rate.id.at.the court held that xerox protest was invalid and could not give rise to jurisdiction under a.id.i t is too much of a reach to construe customs decision to assess column duties as a negative decision regarding preferential nafta treatment.
the court of international trade thus dismissed xerox protest for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.xerox appeals.we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to a.
the court of international trade jurisdictional ruling was based upon that court interpretation of and.we review the court of international trade interpretation of those statutory provisions de novo.goodman,united states.we also review under a de novo standard the decision by the court of international trade to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.friedman daley.
xerox argues on appeal that the court of international trade erred in finding no protestable decision by customs to liquidate xerox entries as entered.recognizing that customs was required by law to fix the final classification and rate of duty applicable to xerox entries,b,xerox contends that customs liquidation of xerox entries as entered presupposes an earlier finding by customs that the entries were not entitled to the preference of nafta.xerox then urges that this finding merged into the liquidation by customs of the subject goods,such that the liquidation itself was a protestable decision.xerox also points to,a regulation that allows an importer to file,before liquidation becomes final,any document necessary for free or reduced duties under any agreement if the importer failure to file upon entry was not the result of willful negligence or fraudulent intent.xerox claims that the court of international trade erred in failing to find the regulation dispositive in its favor.
the government responds that b ecause customs as entered liquidation of xerox merchandise was indisputably correct based on the information provided at entry,and because any potential claim for a nafta preference had expired by the time that xerox filed its protest,the protest was invalid because it was not based on an actual protestable decision.appellee br.at.the government concludes that the court of international trade was correct in dismissing the case because invalid protests can not give rise to jurisdiction under a.
section a of title of the provides a procedural mechanism by which an importer can protest certain decisions of customs.see united states cherry hill textiles,the underlying policy of section is to channel challenges to liquidations through the protest mechanism.at the time of xerox protest,section a provided that 
decisions of the customs service,including the legality of all orders and findings entering into the same,as to 
the appraised value of merchandise 
the classification and rate and amount of duties chargeable 
all charges or exactions of whatever character within the jurisdiction of the secretary of the treasury 
the exclusion of merchandise from entry or delivery or a demand for redelivery to customs custody under any provision of the customs laws,except a determination appealable under section of this title 
the liquidation or reliquidation of an entry,or reconciliation as to the issues contained therein,or any modification thereof 
the refusal to pay a claim for drawback or 
the refusal to reliquidate an entry under section c of this title 
shall be final and conclusive upon all persons unless a protest is filed in accordance with this section,or unless a civil action contesting the denial of a protest,in whole or in part,is commenced in the united states court of international trade 
a emphasis added the section further required an importer to file a section protest within days of customs decision.id.c.section thus provided that a decision by customs pertaining to the classification,rate and amount of duties applied to a given importer entries are final as to that importer and all others,unless the importer protests the decision within days.see juice farms,united states,without a timely protest,all liquidations become final and conclusive under.if customs denies what otherwise is a valid protest,the court of international trade has exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action commenced to contest the denial.see a establishing jurisdiction park smith,united states,the court of international trade is required to decide,on a de novo basis,civil actions that contest the denial of a protest to a customs classification ruling.
under the guise of a section a protest of the liquidation of certain entries of electrostatic photocopiers and wire harnesses,xerox sought to claim in the first instance preferential treatment under nafta.the court of international trade thus appropriately summated the dispositive issue as whether customs made a decision to deny the nafta preference.dismissal at.if customs did,either upon entry of the goods or at liquidation,then xerox protest of the liquidation of its entries as entered rather than at a more preferential nafta rate was a valid protest and gives rise to jurisdiction before the court of international trade.
an importer right to preferential tariff treatment for goods qualifying under the nafta rules of origin does not automatically vest upon entry.see listing rules of origin.an importer seeking preferential treatment is instead required to make a written declaration that the goods qualify for nafta treatment,as is set forth in article of nafta and implemented in a the importer must base the declaration on a properly executed nafta certificate of origin that covers the good being imported.see a a certificate of origin shall be employed to certify that a good being exported either from the united states into canada or mexico or from canada or mexico into the united states qualifies as an originating good for purposes of preferential tariff treatment under the nafta.b describing the submission of a certificate of origin by an importer.
though an importer must submit a written declaration and the appropriate nafta certificates of origin to advantage itself of preferential tariff treatment,an importer need not do so immediately upon entry of the subject goods.article of the agreement provides 
each party shall provide that,where a good would have qualified as an originating good when it was imported into the territory of that party but no claim for preferential tariff treatment was made at that time,the importer of the good may,no later than one year after the date on which the good was imported,apply for a refund of any excess duties paid as the result of the good not having been accorded preferential tariff treatment 
emphasis added.article thus requires that the signatory countries allow a claim for preferential treatment to be made in the first instance at any point in time up to but not later than one year after entry of qualifying goods.
to comply with the terms of article,congress in section of the nafta implementation act amended section of the tariff act of by adding to it a provision allowing customs to refund excess duties paid above those properly due under nafta,if a claim for preferential treatment is made within one year of entry.codified at d,the provision reads 
notwithstanding the fact that a valid protest was not filed,the customs service may,in accordance with regulations prescribed by the secretary,reliquidate an entry to refund any excess duties paid on a good qualifying under the rules of origin set out in section of this title for which no claim for preferential tariff treatment was made at the time of importation if the importer,within year after the date of importation,files,in accordance with those regulations,a claim that includes 
a written declaration that the good qualified under those rules at the time of importation 
copies of all applicable nafta certificates of origin as defined in section b of this title and 
such other documentation relating to the importation of the goods as the customs service may require.
d emphasis added.
to be sure,the history behind the enactment of nafta implementing legislation shows intent by congress to allow for the refund of excess duties paid as a result of incorrect declarations,at.but it also overwhelmingly reiterates the time period for claiming entitlement to a refund premised on nafta eligibility.see id.the importer must,within one year after the date of importation,file a nafta claim in accordance with the implementing regulations,at noting that section authorizes customs to reliquidate an entry and grant nafta tariff treatment to the entry if the importer,within one year of the date of importation,files a claim and provides such documents as may be required see also,at noting that an importer has up to one year to make a claim for a refund of deposited duties when imported merchandise is eligible for nafta preferential tariff rates and that a provision of the miscellaneous trade and technical corrections act of clarifies that the customs service will pay interest as of the date of the importer claim,rather than from the date of deposit of duties,at recognizing cases where an importer has up to a year after the entry to make a claim for preferential tariff treatment under the nafta.
section of the relevant regulations implements article of nafta and d and reinforces the time period for raising a nafta claim in the first instance.see nafta,sections through implement nafta article and section of the act,which allow an importer,who did not claim nafta tariff benefits on a qualifying good at the time of importation,to apply for a refund of any excess duties at any time within one year after the date of importation.section provides 
notwithstanding any other available remedy,including the right to amend an entry so long as liquidation of the entry has not become final,where a good would have qualified as an originating good when it was imported into the united states but no claim for preferential tariff treatment on that originating good was made at that time under a of this part,the importer of that good may file a claim for a refund of any excess duties at any time within one year after the date of importation of the good in accordance with the procedures set forth in of this part.
emphasis added see also id.describing the procedure for filing a nafta claim.
the mandate of article of nafta and of the implementing legislation and regulations is clear the time period provided by law for raising in the first instance a claim for preferential treatment under nafta expires one year from entry of the subject goods.in other words,under the agreement and implementing law,xerox had one year from entry to make a claim for nafta preferential treatment.it did not.
customs must engage in some sort of process in order for there to be a protestable decision.shoe united states,see also mitsubishi elecs,united states,finding that customs merely follows commerce instructions in assessing and collecting antidumping duties and thus does not make an antidumping decision protestable under section dart exp.united states,holding that the assessment of duties at entry based on information provided by the importer can not be a decision within the meaning of section.seeing no claim for nafta treatment at the time of entry,as provided by a,and having before it no valid claim pursuant to d,customs liquidated xerox entries as entered at column normal trade relation duty rates.customs at no time expressly considered the merits of nafta eligibility,nor could it without a valid claim by xerox for such eligibility.we thus hold that it did not make a
