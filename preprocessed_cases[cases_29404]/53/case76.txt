factual background 
the defendant randy reyes was employed by siraj international siraj,a of aviation component and military,from october of until the spring of.the principal actors at siraj during the relevant time period were reyes,the owner and president jami choudhury,and office manager debra martell.when an international customer placed an order with siraj,reyes or choudhury,depending on who had responsibility for the particular client,was responsible for assuring that all exports complied with the aeca and ieepa shortly after reyes was hired by siraj in october,he made contact with a customer named texam holding,located in geneva,switzerland,and operated by mehrad banimostafavi michael bani reyes maintained texam as his own client and handled virtually all transactions between siraj and texam.
at approximately the same time that reyes made contact with texam,another aircraft parts broker named international aircraft support group iasg likewise began receiving orders from texam.in january of,tina bembenek of iasg received a purchase order from texam requesting engine parts for an military aircraft,which in turn served to raise bembenek suspicion,for she was cognizant of the fact that only iran and australia flew the.bembenek called bani texam and inquired as to the of the parts.according to bembenek testimony at trial,bani told her that the parts were destined for singapore.when confronted with bembenek statement that only iran and australia fly the,bani replied,let send them to australia.
in february,bembenek was in switzerland on unrelated business and arranged a meeting with bani in geneva.during this meeting bani disclosed to bembenek that he was an iranian citizen living in switzerland engaged in procuring military aircraft parts for iran and at this time he provided bembenek with a list of american companies with whom he did business.the list included siraj international.
upon bembenek return to the united states,she advised the customs service customs that texam was acting as a front for iran procurement of military aircraft components.thereafter customs initiated an investigation into texam and bembenek agreed to assist in the investigation with the placing and receiving of telephone calls recorded with bani and reyes.in a recorded phone call to reyes made on may,bembenek informed him that she had received correspondence from bani stating that texam intended to ship military aircraft parts purchased from her company iasg to iran.reyes responded,double,indicating that he knew that sales of military equipment to iran were prohibited by federal law.reyes further displayed his knowledge of the law as he informed bembenek at that time that all of his siraj sale documents included a written stipulation that parts sold to texam were destined for texam stock,and he suggested to bembenek that she might make use of the same stipulation to protect herself,stating the only thing i can suggest is stipulate on your orders that this is going to your stock there in geneva 
approximately three weeks after this conversation with bembenek,on june,reyes shipped a number of junction covers and fuel flometer brackets to texam in geneva,switzerland without first having obtained the required licensing permits from the state department.these aircraft parts were contained on the munitions list since they were designed for exclusive use on military aircraft engines,which are used on,and military aircraft.this shipment from milwaukee to switzerland was seized by customs officials at jfk airport on june.about the same time,milwaukee customs agents executed a search warrant at siraj oak creek,wisconsin offices and seized a number of documents relating to siraj business dealings with texam.the customs agents also found numerous documents in reyes office at siraj,including but not limited to pamphlets detailing the state department registration and licensing process containing reyes handwritten notes,a partially completed draft of siraj registrant application containing reyes handwriting,and a copy of the munitions list regulations with handwritten stars and checkmarks next to category viii aircraft and category viii h aircraft component parts contemporaneous with the siraj raid,special customs agent john heyer interviewed reyes while on the premises,and during the interview reyes admitted that texam was his client,that he was aware that the shipment of aircraft parts destined to iran was prohibited by federal law,and when questioned,further stated that bani had informed him that the ultimate user of the airplane parts was either the swiss red cross or texam stock.contrary to his recorded telephone conversation with bembenek of may,reyes falsely stated to heyer that he had never heard from any source that texam supplied aircraft parts to iran,and that he would not have exported any aircraft parts to texam had he any reason to suspect that the parts were destined for iran.
upon the completion of the investigation,a grand jury on october,returned a indictment against reyes,choudhury,bani,and siraj international.count charged all four defendants the three individuals and the company with conspiracy to violate the aeca and ieepa by exporting munitions list aircraft component parts from the united states destined for iran without the necessary government licenses,contrary to.the conspiracy charge alleged three separate illegal shipments from siraj to texam in,including the previously referred to shipment of june.count charged the same four defendants with willful violation of the aeca in connection with a january,shipment of military aircraft component parts from siraj to texam.count charged the four defendants with willful violation of the ieepa in connection with a may,shipment from siraj to texam,and counts and charged all the defendants with willful violations of the aeca and ieepa in connection with the june,shipment from siraj to texam.
in march,five months after return of the indictment and approximately nine months after reyes voluntarily left siraj,ann chiapetta purchased the assets of siraj from jami choudhury and formed a new aircraft parts brokering business known as avitek.martell continued on as an employee of the new company until september,when chiapetta discharged her 
two weeks prior to the commencement of the trial,choudhury pled guilty to a charge of making a false statement to agent heyer on june,in violation of,concerning his lack of knowledge that the aircraft parts siraj sold to texam were destined for iran.as part of its plea agreement with choudhury,the government agreed to dismiss all charges in the indictment against choudhury if he agreed to cooperate with the government in any subsequent investigation and testify truthfully in any trials relating to the subject matter of the indictment.shortly before trial,the corporation siraj changed its plea from one of not guilty to guilty to counts through and count was dismissed.
prosecutors met with martell on october,as part of their preparation for reyes trial,to review the siraj business documents the government intended to introduce in evidence.during that meeting,martell volunteered information to the prosecutors that she had recently been discharged from avitek,as well as making some vague allegations concerning alleged financial improprieties on the part of choudhury and chiapetta relating to the sale of siraj assets.the government did not disclose the information concerning martell vague allegations and suspicions to reyes prior to trial 
at reyes trial,martell identified siraj business documents,and she also gave testimony about the office procedures for telephone calls received from texam reyes was the only employee authorized to speak to bani,and that all faxes received from texam were delivered to reyes only,pursuant to his direction.with regard to her professional relationship with reyes,martell stated that she and reyes on more than one occasion had disagreements regarding office procedures but in response to a question she also testified,i would go that far to say that i did like him.martell,when questioned about her termination from avitek formerly siraj,stated that she did not see eye to eye with the new owner ann chiapetta.
on october,the jury returned guilty verdicts against reyes on counts and violations of the aeca and ieepa concerning the june,shipment,and acquitted reyes on counts,and.after trial,reyes filed a motion for judgment of acquittal,alleging insufficient evidence on counts and,and it was denied.
during the short time frame between reyes sentencing and the time he was to report to the bureau of prisons for assignment to an institution for confinement,he learned of martell allegations made to government agents concerning her suspicions of possible financial by choudhury and chiapetta in connection with the sale of siraj.reyes,armed with the newly disclosed statement of martell suspicions and vague allegations,filed a motion to stay the execution of his sentence pending the filing of a motion for a new trial or a petition for habeas corpus.he argued that the government should have disclosed the fact of martell discharge from avitek and her vague suspicions of misconduct by choudhury and chiapetta,alleging that these facts would have provided reyes with exculpatory evidence an avenue for the impeachment of martell credibility at trial.the trial court denied his motion for a stay of sentence and again ordered him to report to the bureau of prisons.reyes appeals.
ii.issues presented 
reyes raises four issues on appeal.he alleges that the government alleged failure to disclose any information concerning martell termination from avitek and her suspicions of financial on the part of choudhury and chiapetta denied him exculpatory evidence or possible impeachment evidence in violation of his fifth amendment right to due process the guilty verdicts on counts and should be reversed as inconsistent with his acquittal on counts,and the evidence to convict him on counts and was insufficient and the district court committed error in sentencing him to a base level of.
iii.discussion 
a.the government alleged failure to disclose information 
reyes contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecution was obligated to disclose that debra martell had informed prosecutors of her suspicions of financial improprieties on the part of choudhury and chiapetta related to the sale of siraj and debra martell had been discharged from avitek.reyes argues that the government was required to disclose this information to the defense pursuant to brady maryland,d see also united states bagley,d kyles whitley,d.
in brady,the supreme court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith of the prosecution.brady,at.the prosecution obligation to disclose information extends to both exculpatory evidence and facts material to the impeachment of prosecution witnesses,and attaches even in the absence of a specific request by the defendant.united states agurs,d united states allain,cir.before the court can grant a motion for a new trial as a result of an alleged brady violation,the moving party must establish that the prosecution suppressed evidence the evidence allegedly suppressed was favorable to the defense and the evidence was material to an issue at trial.brady,at.united states walton,cir.
evidence is material to the defense if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is that sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.the materiality standard is not met by the mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense,or might have affected the outcome of the trial thus,brady does not require a prosecutor to divulge every scintilla of evidence that might conceivably inure to a defendant benefit.

reyes,in a buckshot approach,attempts to gain a new trial by trying to link the two instances of alleged to the elements of brady by speculating that had he known these facts prior to trial,he would have been able to martell more effectively and impeach her credibility as a witness by supposedly being able to demonstrate that martell termination provided her with some type of motivation to retaliate against reyes despite the fact that reyes had left the company approximately fifteen months before martell discharge establishing that martell accusations against choudhury were made in retaliation for her discharge by chiapetta and using martell accusations against choudhury to,in reyes words,further explore the relationship between choudhury and his employees.
reyes brady claim concerning martell discharge fails because the information was not suppressed by the government,and in fact martell specifically testified during trial about her termination.throughout his appellate brief,reyes insists that he had no way of knowing that martell employment had been terminated,but it is evident from a reading of the record that had reyes paid closer attention during the trial or scrutinized the transcript more closely prior to filing his appeal,he would have been aware of the following questions asked by the prosecution at trial and martell answers 
q when was the last day that you worked for avetech sic 
a the of september.
q and why is it that you no longer work for avitech sic 
a i did get along with the new owner.she fired me.we did see eye to eye.i asked too many questions.emphasis added
