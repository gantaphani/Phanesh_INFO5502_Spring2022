background 
this case involves the seventh and final administrative review of the antidumping duty order on drams from korea,which encompassed the period of review por between may,and december.dynamic random access memory semiconductors of one megabit or above from the republic of korea final results of antidumping duty administrative review,fed.reg,final results dissatisfied with commerce methodology for determining the duty,which was set at,hynix appealed the final results to the court of international trade.
hynix first argued that commerce should have used a hybrid methodology for calculating the duty instead of using only sales completed during the por.second,hynix claimed that commerce should have allowed the amortization of its research and development costs regardless of the fact that hynix had previously expensed such costs.third,hynix disagreed with commerce decision to use all expenses,as opposed to expenses,to calculate the duty.fourth,hynix argued that it should have been allowed to indefinitely defer certain expenses as allowed by korean generally accepted accounting principles gaap.fifth,hynix disputed commerce refusal to offset foreign currency translation losses with the revaluation of fixed assets.
in hynix i,the court affirmed commerce decision to use sales during the por to calculate the duty.it found that commerce had supported its decision by showing that the methodology conformed to both standard practice and the practice in the preceding reviews.the court further found that commerce had explained its decision to abandon the hybrid methodology that was used during the preliminary review.see dynamic random access memory semiconductors of one megabit or above from the republic of korea preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review and notice of intent not to revoke order,fed.reg.june,preliminary results.the court also affirmed commerce refusal to offset hynix foreign currency translation losses with the revaluation of its fixed assets.it agreed with commerce that the revaluation of fixed assets did not represent income and could not,therefore,be used to offset the real losses incurred as the result of holding debt.
conversely,the court remanded the three issues relating to hynix expenses.first,it held that commerce had failed to support its decision disallowing the amortization of costs.on remand,commerce was instructed to explain why hynix amortization of costs,which conformed to korean gaap and had been verified by commerce,did not accurately reflect hynix actual expenses.second,the court remanded commerce refusal to accept expenses,which had also been verified by commerce.third,the court remanded commerce refusal,which was based on the theory of conservatism to allow the indefinite deferral of certain costs.
commerce remand decision closely followed its decision in the final results.see final results of redetermination pursuant to court remand hynix semiconductor,hynix semiconductor america,the united states and micron technology,court june,remand i.commerce continued to hold that hynix should not be allowed to amortize costs because it had expensed such costs in previous reviews.according to commerce,the change in accounting methods,while allowed by korean gaap,distorted the costs of production during the por.commerce also persisted in refusing hynix costs,holding firm to the theory of finally,commerce maintained that hynix had not offered sufficient proof of future income to justify the indefinite deferral of certain expenses.
in hynix ii,the court again and.the court affirmed commerce refusal to allow the indefinite deferral of certain expenses.specifically,it agreed with commerce that hynix had failed to provide documentation supporting its claim that the deferred expenses would produce future revenues.the court,however,again remanded commerce decision disallowing the amortization of expenses and its unwillingness to accept hynix expenses.
on remand for the second time,unable to offer further support,commerce recalculated the duty to,although it maintained its objections for the purposes of appeal.final results of redetermination pursuant to court remand hynix semiconductor,hynix semiconductor america,the united states and micron technology,court.this second remand decision was affirmed in hynix iii.
hynix appealed the court judgments to this court,claiming that commerce decision to use a methodology to determine the dumping duty was inaccurate commerce decision disallowing the indefinite deferral of certain costs was error and commerce decision disallowing the use of fixed asset revaluation to offset foreign currency translation losses was error.commerce and micron the court judgment validating hynix amortization of costs and use of costs.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to a.

methodology 
we turn first to hynix contention that commerce should have calculated the duty based on a hybrid of sales and entries.hynix has an uphill battle because commerce is the master of antidumping law,and reviewing courts must accord deference to the agency in its selection and development of proper methodologies.thai pineapple pub.united states.
hynix argues that a hybrid methodology is preferred,even required,by a because it is more accurate and that,while commerce has often used a methodology,it deviates when circumstances warrant.according to hynix,the circumstances of this case warrant such a departure because consistency,commerce principal desire,is irrelevant in a final review.further,hynix claims that it has provided sufficient data to use a hybrid methodology as illustrated by commerce use of such a methodology in the preliminary results.
commerce counters that section a requires only that the duty apply to all entries the statute does not,however,specify how the duty should be calculated.as a result,commerce argues that it has substantial latitude in choosing a methodology.commerce also notes that e specifically empowers it to use a methodology.further,it is commerce standard practice to use a methodology,and it has in fact used such a methodology in the previous reviews of this merchandise.and,while hynix claims to have sufficient data to support the use of entries,it was unable to match the sales of all entries because some entries were held in inventory until long after the por ended.finally,commerce explained its use of a hybrid methodology in the preliminary results and its reversion to a methodology in the final results.basically,commerce had no justification for departing in the preliminary results from its established practice of using a methodology.
commerce has offered substantial evidence supporting its choice of methodology.section a does not mandate a specific methodology for computing the dumping margin,and section e specifically allows the use of entries,exports,or sales.see allegheny ludlum united states,holding that section a does not indicate how commerce should calculate the dumping margin ad hoc comm.of cal.producers of gray portland cement.int l trade listing commerce reasons for using a methodology.even assuming that hynix provided the necessary data linking entries and sales,commerce need not adopt a hybrid methodology in place of its usual methodology.see allegheny,at holding that nothing in commerce regulations supports the use of a hybrid sales plus entries approach for calculating dumping margins quoting hynix i at thai pineapple,at even if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from evidence contained in the record,this does not mean that commerce findings are not supported by substantial evidence.the methodologies relied upon by commerce in making its determination are presumptively correct,and hynix has failed either to undermine commerce rationale or to support its own position.we therefore affirm the use of a methodology in this review.
ii.research development 
we turn next to commerce treatment of hynix expenses,which requires a clarification of f a,which,in pertinent part,states that,costs shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise,if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country or the producing country,where appropriate and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise.we have interpreted this statute in several previous cases.for example,in thai pineapple,at,we held that a s a general rule,an agency may either accept financial records kept according to generally accepted accounting principles in the country of exportation,or reject the records if accepting them would distort the company true costs.see also am.silicon techs.united states,ntn bearing united states,the government may accept a company records,but it also may reject those records if accepting them would distort the company true costs.the statute and our prior pronouncements are clear.the company has the responsibility of showing that its records are kept in accordance with its home country gaap.if the company meets this burden,commerce may counter with substantial evidence that the records do not comply with the home country gaap.if the records withstand this scrutiny,commerce may show,by substantial evidence,that the costs do not reasonably reflect the costs of production and should not,therefore,be used.see thai pineapple,at if the records are not reasonably reflective of cost,commerce may appropriately deviate from them.this case presents three scenarios which help to clarify the application of section f further.
amortization expensing 
during the value investigation,hynix amortized its expenses see dynamic random access memory semiconductors of one megabit or above from the republic of korea,fed.reg.may.hynix switched methods,however,in the first review,and began expensing its costs in the year that hynix changed from amortizing to expensing,its costs were unusually high.as a result,the court of international trade cautioned commerce not to include all expenses reported in that year in the dumping calculation because it would not fairly represent the cost of production.micron,united states,d.int l trade.in the fifth review,hynix reverted to amortizing.to avoid the effect of changing methods,commerce expensed hynix for all reviews,including the fifth,sixth,and final reviews.hynix did not challenge this practice until the final review,however.now it claims that its choice to amortize as well as its choice to switch methods complies with korean gaap and that commerce verified its records therefore commerce is required by section f to accept its amortized expenses.
commerce acknowledges that hynix decision to change accounting methods complies with korean gaap.nevertheless,commerce argues that it need not accept a company records pursuant to section f if they do not represent the costs of producing the merchandise.in this case,commerce argues that the change between methods has resulted in the underreporting of expenses.as commerce explained,underreporting occurs when a company switches from expensing to amortizing.instead of recognizing of the current year costs in addition to from the previous four years,hynix only recognized during this por because the prior years costs had been expensed.commerce also noted that hynix was unable to show that it had used the questioned accounting methods historically.see am.silicon,at f a states that commerce shall consider the exporter or producer records on allocation of costs only if the records of the exporter or producer have been historically used by the exporter or producer.statement of administrative action,uruguay round agreements act,pub,cong d,doc,vol.i,at the exporter or producer will be expected to demonstrate that it has historically utilized such allocations,particularly with regard to the establishment of appropriate amortization and depreciation periods and allowances for capital expenditures and other development costs.
while hynix was able to show that its records comply with korean gaap,commerce showed by substantial evidence that hynix reported expenses fail to reflect the costs of production.it is facially apparent that a fraction of costs does not accurately capture full costs.even if the inadequacy of this method were not transparent,it would be appropriate for us to defer to commerce judgment that hynix change from amortizing to expensing and back again results in underreporting.see thai pineapple,at antidumping investigations are complex and complicated matters in which commerce has particular expertise and thus,commerce determinations are entitled to deference.further,hynix was not able to demonstrate that it historically used this accounting methodology,which undermines the assumption that its bookkeeping was not influenced by a desire to minimize costs during the review.the court judgment requiring commerce to accept hynix amortized expenses is reversed.the case is remanded to the court with instructions to remand to commerce,which shall recalculate the duty by expensing hynix costs as in the final results.
we turn next to that part of the court judgment requiring commerce to use hynix verified,costs.in the final results,commerce rejected hynix costs in favor of a method that allocated all semiconductor expenses over the total number of semiconductors sold.commerce claimed that this approach more accurately captures expenses attributable to the subject merchandise because,according to the theory of,other semiconductor benefits drams.commerce was able to offer only two pieces of support for this assertion.first,it relied on the expertise of murzy jhabvala,a semiconductor engineer,who conducted a study showing that for one type of semiconductor influenced the development of srams.jhabvala extrapolated from this study,without assessing hynix operations specifically,that all of hynix semiconductor research benefits drams.second,aside from this theoretical assessment of hynix environment,commerce relied on exhibit of the department verification report,which listed projects in hynix labs the list contained names that appeared to indicate that hynix labs were being used for memory research,even research on drams specifically.hynix,on the other hand,argues that commerce must accept its verified,costs pursuant to section f,and,further,that section e a requires commerce to use actual values,such as those provided by hynix,when available.
this precise issue was presented to the court in a prior review of the same merchandise.in micron technology,united states.int l trade,aff,the court required commerce to accept the expenses reported by hynix.in so doing,it noted that the validity of commerce methodology can not rest on intuitive appeal alone rather,the factual premise upon which commerce bases its choice of methodology must be supported by substantial evidence on the record.at.we agree with this assessment and adopt it as our own.jhabvala opinion,while probative of the company he investigated or potentially srams generally,bears little relation to either hynix or drams.and,as noted by hynix,the list of projects cited by commerce is paltry evidence of,because project names,without proof of the underlying activities,do little to show that all semiconductor has impacted the dev
