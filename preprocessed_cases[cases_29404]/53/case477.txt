this exclusion action was initiated on the complaint of minnesota mining and manufacturing company and ultimate abrasive systems collectively under a b ii,formerly a of the tariff act of as amended variously called a.the international trade commission found that the process claimed in united states patent the patent,owned by,was being used in taiwan to produce certain abrasive articles that were imported by the kinik company into the united states we conclude that on the correct claim construction the process of the patent was not practiced the judgment of infringement is reversed.
the commission ruling that the defenses available under g do not apply to actions under a b ii is affirmed.

the commission held that the recently enacted defenses to infringement,when the issue is offshore practice of a patented process,do not apply to infringement actions before the international trade commission.kinik states that this ruling is incorrect,and that all defenses to infringement are by statute available in itc actions.thus kinik states that even if its process were found to include all the steps of the claims,the product of those steps is materially changed by subsequent processes,placing kinik within the exception provided by g 
g.whoever without authority imports into the united states or offers to sell,sells,or uses within the united states a product which is made by a process patented in the united states shall be liable as an infringer,if the importation,offer to sell,sale,or use of the product occurs during the term of such process patent.in an action for infringement of a process patent,no remedy may be granted for infringement on account of the noncommercial use or retail sale of a product unless there is no adequate remedy under this title for infringement on account of the importation or other use,offer to sell,or sale of that product.a product which is made by a patented process will,for purposes of this title,not be considered to be so made after 
it is materially changed by subsequent processes or 
it becomes a trivial and nonessential component of another product.
the commission held that the exceptions set forth in g and do not apply as defenses to a actions.kinik challenges this holding,pointing out that c states that a ll legal and equitable defenses may be presented in all cases.see lannom united states int l trade comm n,the commission recognizes the same defenses and applies the same burdens of proof as in the courts.kinik states that congress did not create an exception for itc actions upon enactment of g,and that the commission incorrectly held otherwise.
the commission relied for its interpretation on the process patent amendments act of,which states,in adding g to title,that t he amendments made by this subtitle shall not deprive a patent owner of any remedies available under section of the tariff act of,or under any other provision of law.pub,c.the commission held that the new defenses under g were not intended to be available in itc actions,for to hold otherwise would deprive the patent owner of a remedy available under the tariff act.the commission pointed to the explicit statement that the existing scope of actions would not be diminished,and that g,in the clause introducing the new defenses to infringement by overseas practice,states that they are for purposes of this title.such clause would have been unnecessary unless it served to avert conflict between the patent act and the tariff act,for the contemporaneous record shows that such conflict was recognized.see duncan walker,d it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.
the enactment of g was part of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of,pub,stat.it was explained that g was intended to provide patent owners the new right to sue for damages and seek an injunction in federal district court when someone,without authorization,uses or sells in the united states,or imports into the united states a product made by their patented process.at.the purpose of g was to authorize the district courts to adjudicate and impose liability for infringement based on the overseas practice of processes patented in the united states,upon importation of the products of those processes.previously,remedy was available only by exclusion action under the tariff act.
since c states that all legal and equitable defenses may be presented in commission actions,kinik argues that the new defenses of g apply in a actions.however,c of the process patent amendments act,supra,states the intent to preserve all existing remedies,as elaborated in the senate report 
there is no intention to impose any of these limitations on owners of products or on owners of process patents in suits they are able to bring under existing law.neither is there any intention for these provisions to limit in any way the ability of process patent owners to obtain relief from the international trade commission.
the commission ruled that the enactment of g preserved a undiminished by the new defenses provided for g actions in district court.to the extent that there is any uncertainty or ambiguity in the interpretation of a and its successor a b ii,deference must be given to the view of the agency that is charged with its administration.chevron,natural resources defense council,d.in amgen,united states int l trade comm n,this court observed that no material changes were made in the text of a b ii as reenacted in,despite the concurrent enactment of g,reinforcing the intention to preserve the scope of former.the amgen court pointed out that g expressly limited the new defenses to infringement for purpose of this title.although kinik argues that it is anomalous to create a legislative distinction in the defenses available in different tribunals,before this enactment there was an even greater distinction,for overseas manufacture could not be reached at all in the district courts.
the commission interpretation of its statute is supported by the text of the statutes,by the legislative history,and by precedent.we affirm the commission ruling that the defenses established in g are not available in a b ii actions.
infringementthe volume of binder 
the patent is directed to a method for the manufacture of an abrasive article by first making a soft and flexible from a mixture containing a liquid binder,powdered matrix material,and abrasive particles,and then sintering the preform.claim,the broadest claim in suit,follows 
in a method for making an abrasive article wherein a plurality of abrasive particles and a quantity of powdered sinterable matrix material are combined together and sintered to form the article,the improvement comprising forming a soft,easily deformable and flexible preform from a mixture of said quantity of powdered sinterable matrix material and a liquid binder composition,including a plurality of abrasive particles at least partially in said preform and then sintering said preform to form said abrasive article.
kinik states that claim,correctly construed,is limited to preform mixtures that contain a larger volume of liquid binder composition than powdered matrix material,for that is the invention described in the spe
