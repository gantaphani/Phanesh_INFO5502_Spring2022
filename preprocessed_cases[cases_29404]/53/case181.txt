this appeal concerns customs and border protection customs decision to treat ford motor company ford duty refund claims under the north american free trade agreement nafta differently depending on whether those claims were filed traditionally or through an electronic process known as reconciliation.we previously remanded this dispute to the trade court for a narrow inquiry whether there is a reasonable explanation for customs decision to treat the claims differently.ford motor united states,ford iv.on remand,customs first explained that traditional refund claims and reconciliation claims are governed by different implementing statutes thus,customs was not inconsistent in its treatment of identical claims.second,customs noted that even if both types of claims were governed by the same statute,procedural differences among traditional and reconciliation claims justify treating the claims differently.the court of international trade trade court found customs explanation reasonable.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
we provided a detailed explanation of the background of this case in ford iv.at.thus,we only briefly recite the pertinent facts here.ford imported automotive goods into the united states and paid the duties on them.ford later claimed nafta preference on those imports and filed for refund of the duties it paid under d.the parties agreed to rely on one entry as the test case a june,entry via detroit.under d default procedures implemented by,ford was required to file the certificates of origin within one year of importation.but ford did not file the certificate of origin until november,beyond the filing deadline.ford was also unable to secure the port director written waiver for the certificates under d i.customs denied ford claim,stating that the certificate of origin was not furnished within one year of the date of importation.ford filed a protest to contest the denial,and customs denied the protest on the same grounds.
in ford iv,ford contended that customs had an affirmative obligation under its own regulation to accept ford untimely filing of the certificates.we rejected that argument.ford iv,at.ford only remaining contention was that customs refusal to grant ford a waiver for the certificates was arbitrary and capricious based on customs waiver of the filing requirement in a separate reconciliation program.ford argued that its traditional refund claims,although not processed through the reconciliation program,should nevertheless enjoy the same waiver benefit available through that program.id.previously,the trade court did not explore customs authority and reasoning for waiving the certificate filing requirement under the reconciliation program because ford claims at issue were not processed through that program.id.we remanded to the trade court to conduct this limited inquiry.id.at.
on remand,customs explained that the reconciliation program,authorized by b,is a procedural means for processing import entries.ford motor united states,d.int l trade ford v.among the features of the reconciliation program is an ability to claim the substantive duty refund benefit under d.id.customs explained that the reconciliation program has a set of statutory safeguards that permit customs to remedy mistakes and misconduct in awarding duty free treatment under nafta.id.at.many of the reconciliation program statutory safeguards are not available in the traditional duty refund process.id.at.the trade court noted that the reconciliation program provides customs an added level of confidence in the legitimacy of the importer claims.see id.at the record keeping requirements and auditing procedures give customs procedures for ensuring the correctness of entries made through the fully automated reconciliation program.under chevron natural resources defense council,d,the trade court concluded that customs interpretation of the statutory scheme entrusted to its administration was reasonable.ford v,d at.
discussion 
we review legal conclusions from customs and the trade court de novo,universal electronics united states,subject to any deference owed to customs statutory interpretations,princess cruises,united states.we similarly review law of the case de novo.see laitram nec.
when congress has explicitly left a gap for an agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,and any ensuing regulation is binding in the courts unless procedurally defective,arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to the statute.united states mead,d citing chevron,at.if a statute is ambiguous,and if the implementing agency construction is reasonable,chevron requires a federal court to accept the agency construction of the statute,even if the agency reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d citing chevron,at.
on appeal,ford contends that customs remand explanation violates the law of the case and that it is not reasonable.we address each contention in turn.
law of the case 
ford argues that this court held in the prior appeals of this case that a single statute,d,codifies nafta duty refund claims process.ford therefore insists that customs remand explanation implicating a different statute violates the law of the case.we disagree.
in our prior decisions,we merely explained that d implements the duty refund allowed by a particular nafta article.see ford motor united states,ford ii.we did not,however,state that it was the only statutory provision that implements the duty refund process.the law of the case doctrine is limited to issues that were actually decided,either explicitly or by necessary implication,in the earlier litigation.see toro white consol.because our prior decisions did not decide that nafta duty refund claims process is exclusively governed by d,ford contention based on the law of the case is incorrect.
reasonableness of customs remand explanation 
ford argues that the trade court erred in both affording chevron deference to customs remand explanation and in finding the explanation reasonable.we disagree on both counts.
trade court correctly applied chevron deference 
ford argues that customs remand explanation conflict s with the law of the case,customs published interpretation of the reconciliation program,the relevant statutes,and the nafta treaty itself.appellant br.ford relies on bowen georgetown university hospital,d,for the proposition that there is no deference to agency litigating positions that are wholly unsupported by regulations,rulings,or administrative practice.appellant br.ford therefore concludes that no deference is owed to customs incorrect interpretation of the nafta,d,and the reconciliation program.id.at.
the premise for all of ford alleged conflicts is that d is the exclusive authority for nafta duty refund claims process and that a variety of legal and regulatory authorities have repeatedly said so.see id.at nafta refund claims submitted through the reconciliation program are subject to all requirements of d including its filing deadline in sum,in nearly every published reference to nafta reconciliation,customs includes a citation to d.but ford contentions are based on a misreading of those legal and regulatory authorities.
it is true that those authorities mention d in discussing the reconciliation program feature for claiming duty refunds.but those authorities do not state that d exclusively governs the procedure for claiming refunds through the reconciliation program,including the ability to obtain a waiver of certificates of origin.rather,d explicitly delegates authority to customs to prescribe regulations to govern the refund claims process.d.customs exercised that authority by promulgating to govern the traditionally filed duty refund claims process.similarly,customs was duly authorized by b to implement the reconciliation program,a procedural means for processing import entries.customs has interpreted the various statutes as creating two separate frameworks one governs customs waiver authority with respect to traditionally filed claims,and the other prescribes the particular process of waiver with respect to claims.that interpretation is not inconsistent with relevant statutes,regulations,or administrative practices.
the dissent disagrees and concludes that chevron deference does not apply to customs remand explanation.dissent at.it argues that customs present reliance on b during judicial review is contrary to its focus on d during the administrative process.id.emphasizing customs notice in the federal register that reconciliation is a vehicle by which refunds and certificate of origin waivers are granted under d id.at congress has delegated to the administrative official and not to appellate counsel the responsibility for elaborating and enforcing statutory commands.quoting bowen,at.accordingly,the dissent dismisses customs explanation as merely a convenient litigation position not entitled to chevron deference.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the dissent is misplaced.in bowen,the agency litigation position was contrary to the agency past implementation of the particular statutory provision governing the disputed claims.at see also id.at.the context here is far different.first,ford import entries at issue were not processed through the reconciliation program.see ford iv,at it is undisputed that ford request for a refund of duties paid on the entry was not made through the reconciliation program.indeed,the controversy over the reconciliation program was initially determined by the trade court to be irrelevant.id.at noting that the trade court dismissed ford reconcilia tion program argument in a footnote,stating that ford entries were not subject to the program and the court inquiry must focus on the statutory and regulatory scheme which governed ford entries alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.customs thus had no reason to address the argument that it was treating traditionally filed claims differently from those made under the reconciliation program until we specifically remanded to the trade court to make that determination in ford iv.id.at noting that,given the procedural history of the case,it is not surprising that the record provides no explanation for customs divergent approaches to exercising its d waiver power and remanding to the trade court to consider whether there is a reasonable explanation for treating traditional d claims differently than d claims made under the reconciliation program.because the reconciliation program was not previously material to the administrative adjudication of ford claims,customs remand explanation regarding b is not merely a litigation position.
second,there is no allegation that customs had extended the reconciliation program certificate filing waiver to other traditional tariff refund claims but refused to do the same for ford traditional refund claims at issue.the dissent and ford reliance on bowen is therefore misplaced and the trade court was correct to apply chevron deference in reviewing customs remand explanation.
customs remand explanation is reasonable 
customs justifies the reconciliation program certificate filing waiver based on numerous procedural safeguards not available in the traditional claims process.ford v,d at.indeed,it is undisputed that the reconciliation program has additional safeguards,such as the requirement for importers to post a continuous bond.that alone is a reasonable explanation for the difference in treatment between traditional claims and claims.
the dissent dismisses that explanation by citing the availability of other enforcement tools common to both processes.the fact that both processes have some of the same safeguards does not,however,negate the added protection that the additional safeguards provide under the reconciliation program.and,as stated above,there is no dispute that the reconciliation program requirement of a continuous bond provides an additional protection for customs against improper tariff refund claims.
we are satisfied with customs explanation that the differences between the reconciliation program and the traditional duty refund process warrant different filing requirements.we therefore agree with the trade court that customs remand explanation is reasonable.having satisfied our mandate in ford iv,our inquiry goes no further.
conclusion 
customs remand explanation provides a reasonable explanation for the different filing requirements in the traditional duty refund process and in claiming duty refund through the reconciliation program.
i find no principled explanation for customs decision in this case to treat duty refund claims under nafta differently depending on whether those claims were filed traditionally or through an electronic process known as reconciliation.i dissent.
background 
the fundamental purpose of nafta is to provide preferential trade treatment to goods and services that originate within the nafta region.central to nafta purpose is the certificate of origin.the certificate of origin is a document certifying that goods originate in the nafta region and hence qualify for preferential tariff treatment.north american free trade agreement.an importer may claim preferential tariff treatment at importation or may later claim a refund under d for excess duties paid at entry.id,at implemented by d.either claim requires a valid certificate of origin,unless the importation does not exceed a certain value,id.a,b,at,or the importing country has waived the requirement for a certificate of origin,id.c,at.customs waives the certificate of origin for d refund claims in two contexts.
first,for traditional refund claims,customs follows.section d reflects the nafta certificate of origin exceptions set out in nafta article with some variation.the regulation provides that a certificate of origin is not required for importation of goods,id.d ii,commercial importation of goods whose value does not exceed provided an interested party certifies the goods as originating goods or customs waives this requirement,id.d iii,and importation of goods for which customs has waived the certificate of origin requirement,id.d i.customs waives possession of the certificate of origin under d i on a basis.
second,for refund claims filed electronically through the automated commercial system acs reconciliation prototype,customs published a notice in the federal register indicating that customs would waive presentation of the certificate of origin for any importer who participates in the reconciliation program,but the filer must retain the certificate,which shall be provided to customs upon request.revised national customs automation program test regarding reconciliation,replacing notice published.this dispute arises from customs decision to waive the requirement for ford to present certificates of origin for refund claims filed through reconciliation but not to waive the requirement for similar claims filed traditionally.
factual history 
upon nafta entry into effect,certificates of origin created difficulty for the respective customs authorities of the contracting parties,particularly in the automotive sector.ford struggled to generate certificates in time to claim preferential tariff treatment at entry.in brief,the large number of suppliers and significantly large number of parts and components sourced around the world made it difficult for importers to acquire certificates,especially within nafta timeframes.as a result,ford paid duties on originating goods at entry and filed traditional d refund claims when the certificates of origin for those entries became available.due to increased nafta trade,customs had difficulty processing the high volume of claims,and the lack of a paperless process for submitting certificates compounded the problem.
reconciliation was designed to alleviate growing complexities in processing international trade,including problems associated with traditional d refund claims.reconciliation allows importers to file entry summaries using the best available information and electronically flag indeterminable information,with the understanding that the importer will provide customs the information at a later date.acs reconciliation prototype a guide to compliance.when information becomes available,the importer files a new entry providing customs with the information necessary to correct the original entry summary and adjust duties owed by the importer.ford and other importers worked with customs to develop reconciliation in the years following nafta effective date.reconciliation took effect on october,and customs extended the program indefinitely beginning october.
before reconciliation was fully operational,ford worked with local ports of entry to develop interim reconciliation for processing electronically submitted d refund claims.as customs acknowledged during development of reconciliation,these local,informal versions of reconciliation were problematic because they varied a great deal from place to place.ford nevertheless found success with interim reconciliation at several ports of entry.some ports of entry allowed ford to electronically file d refund claims without certificates of origin,given that customs could not yet accommodate electronically filed certificates,even for claims that were otherwise filed electronically.
while ford succeeded with interim reconciliation at some ports of entry,ford met resistance at the detroit port of entry.anticipating difficulty with electronically filing certificates of origin,ford wrote a letter dated july,to the customs detroit port director requesting permission to submit cd rom disks including certificate of origin data associated with electronically filed d refund claims.the detroit port director took ford request under advisement but did not formally respond until april.
in the interim,ford imported automobile parts from canada into the united states through the port of detroit as usual.because ford did not yet have certificates of origin,ford did not claim preferential tariff treatment at the time of importation and instead paid duties as prescribed by the applicable provisions of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states.ford later submitted more than refund claims under d through the electronic protest module of customs automated commercial system acs.because the customs protest module could not accept paper documents such as copies of certificates of origin,ford submitted refund claims without certificates,in accordance with interim reconciliation processes ford had developed at other ports.
after ford had submitted hundreds of d claims without certificates,the detroit port director responded to ford request to provide certificates of origin on cd rom disks,which by now was close to two years old,through two letters dated april.in one letter,the port director permitted ford to file d claims on a cd rom disk,yet required ford to supply the paper documentation required by the regulations.in another letter,the port director acknowledged some confusion surrounding ford d claims filed without certificates of origin and requested the missing certificates within days.id.at.
in response to the port director request,ford attempted to work with the port of detroit to find an efficient process for submitting the certificates of origin.ford proposed electronically filing the certificates,but the port of detroit rejected the proposal,stating that no electronic format for receiving certificates of origin has been approved.on june,customs headquarters informed ford that its request to electronically file the missing certificates had been officially denied.
negotiations having failed,ford complied with the port director request by submitting hard copies of the certificates during the period of august,to december.despite ford submissions,on june,the port of detroit informed ford that its d refund claims were being denied because,while the d claims were timely filed within one year of importation,the certificates of origin were not,and thus the claims were untimely.
though hundreds of ford d claims were affected,the parties agree to use a single representative entry the representative automobile parts entered the united states from canada on june.as with other entries,ford did not claim preferential treatment at importation but instead filed a d refund claim without certificates of origin on may,less than one year after the date of importation.ford submitted the certificates on november,over a year after importation.customs denied ford claim,stating that the certificate of origin was not furnished within one year of the date of importation.ford filed a protest to contest the denial,and customs denied the protest on the same grounds.
at around the time ford sought review by customs of the representative entry,ford had pending protests of denied d claims filed through reconciliation.customs ruled in ford favor on each of these protests,reasoning that there is no apparent dispute that the importations at issue met the substantive criteria for eligibility for nafta preference.customs acknowledged the fact that customs liquidated certain claims with preference under these same facts creates the risk that ford claim of treatment in this case might be accepted by a court.id.for the representative entry,however,customs did not waive the certificate of origin requirement,as it had done for contemporaneous reconciliation claims.
procedural history 
ford sought review of customs decision to deny its refund claim for the representative entry in the trade court.ford motor united states.int l trade,available at wl.the trade court dismissed ford complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,reasoning that a certificate of origin is an element of a d refund claim that must be filed within one year of importation.id.at citation omitted.the trade court explained that by not filing the certificate of origin within one year of importation,ford had not met d requirements.id.customs in turn had not reached a decision on ford protest sufficient for trade court jurisdiction under a,because a decision under a requires a claim filed in accordance with law.id.
this court reversed.ford ii,at.the court explained that d is not a provision because congress has not clearly labeled d timely certificate filing requirement as jurisdictional.id.at.s o long as notice of a party d claim is timely filed within one year of importation,failure to adhere to d formalities will not deprive the trade court of jurisdiction to hear the case.id.the court predicated its holding on customs authority under d to waive the certificate of origin,noting that while d does not expressly mention certificate of origin waiver,it is obvious that d was designed in part to permit the implementation of nafta article c waiver authority.id.at.
on remand,the trade court upheld the merits of customs decision,reasoning that d and implementing regulations require importers to file within one year of importation copies of applicable certificates of origin.ford motor united states,d.int l trade.ford argued that customs improperly treated traditional claims filed under d differently than claims filed through reconciliation,waiving the certificate of origin requirement for reconciliation claims but refusing to do so for traditional d claims.the trade court dismissed the argument,stating that ford entries were not subject to the reconciliation program and the court inquiry must focus on the statutory and regulatory scheme which governed ford entries.id.at.
this court vacated the trade court decision.ford iv,at.the court held that customs may deny a d claim if certificates of origin have not been filed within one year of importation,and the requirement to file them has not been waived.id.at.in contrast to the trade court reasoning,however,the court found reconciliation relevant to customs denial of ford claims because the record reflects that customs has approved ford requests for refunds made through the reconciliation program when ford did not submit the related certificates of origin within one year.id.at.accordingly,the ford iv court remanded this case to the trade court to determine whether there is a reasonable explanation for treating traditional d claims differently than d claims made under the reconciliation program.id.at.on remand,the trade court ordered customs to explain why it treated ford d claims differently depending on the manner in which ford filed the claim.customs explained that this court inquiry appears to be based upon the incorrect assumption that customs authority to waive presentation of the certificate of origin stems solely from the nafta and d.remand report.customs argued that it had authority to waive the certificate of origin under a wholly different set of statutes,namely,s,and,which govern the reconciliation process.id.customs thus contended that its inconsistent treatment of ford refund claims is not the result of two different interpretations of d.id.customs explained further that it was justified in granting blanket certificate of origin waivers for reconciliation claims and not doing the same for traditional refund claims because the reconciliation statutes,unlike d and associated regulations,provide strong remedies to customs should it later discover that the claimed goods are not entitled to nafta preference.id.at.
after reviewing customs explanation,the trade court again upheld customs decision to deny ford refund claim.ford motor united states,d.int l trade.according to the trade court,customs statutory interpretation warrants deference because customs explanation involved the interpretation of the statutory scheme customs is entrusted to administer.id.at citing chevron,nat.res.def.council,d.the trade court found that customs reasonably concluded that waiver for reconciliation claims is governed by statutory safeguards that are inapplicable to waiver for traditional d claims.id.at.ford timely appealed,challenging both the trade court authority to accept customs remand explanation under law of the case and this court prior mandates,in addition to the merits of customs explanation.
discussion 
this court reviews legal conclusions from customs and the trade court de novo,universal elecs.united states,subject to any deference owed to customs statutory interpretations,princess cruises,united states.for the reasons explained below,i would find that no deference is due and therefore review the statutes de novo.see id.statutory interpretation by the court of international trade is reviewed de novo.
customs remand explanation includes two distinct arguments.first,customs argues that its authority to waive certificates of origin stems from two separate statutory schemes.as a result,customs stresses that it is not interpreting the same statute differently and thus need not offer a reasonable explanation for treating ford claims differently.second,customs argues that the process governing refund claims differs depending on whether a refund claim is filed traditionally or through reconciliation.customs second argument is consistent with the notion that even if waiver authority stems solely from d,the difference between the regulatory process governing the two different types of refund claims provides a reasonable explanation for customs different treatment of waiver authority granted by the same statute,d.see ford,d at although d may establish customs waiver authority in general,it does not control the actual process of waiver with respect to claims.neither argument is persuasive.
statutory authority to waive certificates of 
origini.deference 
the majority opinion states that the trade court was correct to apply chevron deference in reviewing customs remand explanations.op.at.a court reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute it is entrusted to administer applies chevron deference if the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of congressionally delegated authority.united states mead,d.an agency may exercise congressionally delegated authority through adjudication,rulemaking,or through some other legislative type of activity indicative of comparable congressional intent.id.at.
ford argues that no deference is due because customs remand explanation is far removed not only from the process,but from any other circumstances reasonably suggesting that congress ever thought of deserving deference.appellant br.at quoting mead,at.customs repeats the trade court rationale that customs interpretation is reasonable under chevron.yet customs fails to explain why its remand explanation should be afforded chevron deference at all.
i would find that chevron deference does not apply to customs remand explanation.customs does not identify any instance in which it officially interpreted its authority to waive certificates of origin for refund claims as stemming from reconciliation statutes.to the contrary,customs publications suggest that reconciliation is a vehicle by which refunds and certificate of origin waivers are granted under d.see,modification of national customs automation program test regarding reconciliation,characterizing reconciliation as a vehicle to file refunds claims under d emphases added.see also,modification and clarification of procedures of the national customs automation program test regarding reconciliation,there are two ways to make a d nafta claim one way is to file a traditional d claim and the other is to make a d claim in accordance with the reconciliation process.
the trade court agreed that customs sources consistently cite d as authority for issuing refunds through reconciliation.ford,d at the court notes that customs has not always provided importers the clearest guidance on this issue and has referenced d when discussing the reconciliation program,which implies that waiver is the same whether the claim was made through reconciliation or not.customs points to no regulations,letters,or documents supporting its current interpretation.customs remand explanation thus finds no basis in any source that would ordinarily demand chevron deference.
customs argued in its brief to this court prior to this court most recent remand that the reconciliation program was consistent with waiver authority under d.in its brief,customs explained that customs expressly waived the timely submission of the certificate of origin requirement of d with regard to all claims submitted pursuant to customs reconciliation program.appellee br.at.customs explained that reconciliation program certificate waiver arose under d i,because customs satisfies itself that imported goods will qualify for nafta treatment when it accepts participants into the reconciliation program.ford iv,at.
at oral argument,customs still indicated that its ability to waive the certificate of origin filing requirement under reconciliation was pursuant to nafta section,therefore arising under d i.oral argument at,available athttp.uscourts.customs argued that the application process governing reconciliation justified treating the two types of refund claims differently.ford iv,at.
customs interpretation morphed on remand.in its brief in the current appeal,customs argues that its remand report justifies the different treatment given to certificate of origin waivers under traditional section d claims and to section d claims made through the reconciliation program.appellee br.at.
the majority opinion finds that customs exercised its authority to prescribe regulations to govern traditional d claims by promulgating,and that customs was duly authorized by b to implement the reconciliation program.op.at.it explains that customs has interpreted the various statutes as creating two separate frameworks one governs customs waiver authority with respect to claims,and the other prescribes the particular process of waiver with respect to claims.while this may be custom current interpretation,i would not accord this interpretation deference,as there is no indication that customs interpreted the statutes this way in the past.
it appears that customs current interpretation of the basis for waiver in reconciliation as arising not under d and d i but instead under other statutes discussing reconciliation generally was crafted for the purpose of this litigation.as a mere convenient litigation position,customs interpretation is not entitled to chevron deference.see bowen georgetown,d.congress has delegated to the administrative official and not to appellate counsel the responsibility for elaborating and enforcing statutory commands.id.quoting
