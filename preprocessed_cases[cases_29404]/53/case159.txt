background 
this appeal stems from four collection actions in which the government sought to recover unpaid antidumping duties from ahac,a surety.ahac secured three different importers importation of preserved and crawfish tail meat from china by issuing numerous single transaction and continuous entry bonds in and.the issued bonds obligated the importers and ahac to pay,up to the face amounts of the bonds,any duty,tax or charge and compliance with law or regulations resulting from covered activities.customs liquidated the entries secured by the bonds and assessed antidumping duties on the merchandise.each importer failed to pay the duties owed.the parties do not dispute that ahac is liable for the principal amounts of antidumping duties owed on the bonds.
after liquidation,customs started charging statutory interest on the unpaid duties of two of the collections that did not exceed the face amount of the bonds pursuant to d d interest.from to,customs issued multiple demands notifying ahac of the government intent to seek d interest.ahac protested the government demands and customs denied the protest.ahac could have challenged customs denial at the trade court under a,but elected not to do so.in,the government commenced four suits at the trade court for the collection of unpaid duties and interest,which the trade court consolidated.after discovery,the parties for summary judgment.relevant to this appeal,the parties disputed the application of equitable prejudgment interest,d interest,and statutory prejudgment interest under interest.
the trade court granted in part and denied in part both the government and ahac motions.it ordered ahac to pay d interest up to the face amounts of the bonds.it held that d interest involves charges or exactions of whatever character under a and that the statute does not contain an exception for charges or exactions arising after liquidation.it held that the bonds statutorily and contractually serve to secure the payment of duties and any interest they do not distinguish between pre and interest.it held that because the d interest determination is final and conclusive under a and ahac failed to contest its denied protest,ahac was precluded from asserting any defenses regarding its liability for d interest.
the trade court also held ahac liable for interest,which is statutory prejudgment interest.the trade court declined to award equitable prejudgment interest because the rate of the interest far exceeds the applicable rates at which the government would receive equitable interest and awarding equitable prejudgment interest in these circumstances would the government.the government appeals the trade court denial of equitable interest,and ahac the trade court award of and d interest to the government.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review the trade court grant or denial of summary judgment for correctness as a matter of law and we decide de novo the proper interpretation of the governing statute and regulations as well as whether genuine issues of material fact exist.united states am.home assur,fed.cir.ahac i.we review the trade court determination not to award equitable prejudgment interest for abuse of discretion.princess cruises,united states,fed.cir.
equitable prejudgment interest 
the government argues the trade court erred in denying the government equitable prejudgment interest because its decision was predicated on the assumption that interest is compensatory.it argues the purpose of equitable prejudgment interest is to compensate the government for the time value of money,whereas the purpose of interest is to penalize a noncompliant party.we do not agree with the government.while we agree that interest and equitable prejudgment interest are not mutually exclusive,the mere availability of dual sources of prejudgment interest does not mandate their application in every case.the trade court retains broad discretion to apply equitable prejudgment interest in accordance with the facts of each case.
equitable prejudgment interest serves to compensate for the loss of use of money due as damages from the time the claim accrues until judgment is entered,thereby achieving full compensation for the injury those damages are intended to redress.princess cruises,at quoting west virginia united states.no statute or regulation explicitly authorizes equitable prejudgment interest its award is governed by traditional principles.id.a court may consider in awarding equitable prejudgment interest may include the degree of wrongdoing on the part of the defendant,the availability of alternative investment opportunities to the plaintiff,whether the plaintiff delayed bringing the action,and other considerations of fairness.united states great am.ins.of,fed.cir.
in its entirety,states upon all bonds,on which suits are brought for the recovery of duties,interest shall be allowed,at the rate of per centum a year,from the time when said bonds became due.section applies to bonds securing the payment of antidumping duties when the government sues for payment under those bonds.ahac i,at.
generally,equitable remedies are unavailable when a party has an adequate statutory remedy.morales trans world airlines,accord west virginia,at in the absence of an applicable federal statute,it is for the federal courts to determine,according to their own criteria,the measure of damage,expressed in terms of interest,for nonpayment of the amount found to be due.ahac argues that to allow both statutory prejudgment interest at and equitable prejudgment interest would amount to a windfall to the government and permit double recovery or more.in the current environment where interest rates are less than,the statutory rate chosen by congress under amounts to full recovery plus some.this,of course,is congress choice and we are bound by the statute.
the availability of statutory interest would normally render equitable interest unavailable.here,however,congress expressly indicated the availability of both statutory and equitable prejudgment interest when it enacted the trade facilitation and trade enforcement act of tftea.see pub,stat.tftea provided authority for the government to deposit interest earned on antidumping duties into the special account created by the continued dumping and subsidy offset act.congress recognized that interest earned on antidumping duties includes e quitable interest under common law and interest under section of this title awarded by a court against a surety under its bond for late payment of antidumping duties.id.c c emphasis added.the plain meaning of this statutory language indicates that congress recognized that a court may award both equitable and interest.see also ahac i,at.
that the trade court may,in its discretion,award dual sources of prejudgment interest does not mean that the trade court must award dual sources of prejudgment interest when the government brings an action to recover duties.the fact that the plain language of covers bonds securing the payment of antidumping duties does not transform the statute into one that is punitive in nature.in fact,the statute expressly designates the monies as interest.we conclude that the trade court retains broad discretion to apply nonstatutory prejudgment interest according to traditional equitable principles,which is exactly what it did in this case.
the trade court did not abuse its discretion in that equitable prejudgment interest is.it recognized our decision in ahac i and noted that an award under may alter the landscape with respect to equitable prejudgment relief.ahac ii,supp.at quoting ahac i,at.the trade court then reviewed various equitable factors,noting that the government did not unrea
