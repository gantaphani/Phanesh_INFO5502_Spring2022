boston telecommunications group,btg and roderick marshall collectively,marshall appeal from the judgment of dismissal of claims against robert wood arising out of an allegedly fraudulent business venture.the district court dismissed the action on forum non conveniens grounds.we have jurisdiction over marshall appeal pursuant to,and we reverse.
the following are facts as alleged in marshall first amended complaint,except where otherwise stated.in late and early,marshall,a united states citizen,was living and working in bratislava,slovakia,providing legal services to various slovak entities.during much of this time,he shared office space with deloitte touche slovakia,deloitte slovakia,an entity providing consulting,auditing and other professional services.marshall became acquainted with another american citizen,robert wood,who was then managing partner of deloitte slovakia.
around april,wood began soliciting marshall to invest in a business venture being pursued by a deloitte slovakia client,global cable systems,gcs,a canadian company.wood told marshall that gcs was planning to acquire two bulgarian cable television companies the bulgarian venture,but needed funds to consummate the purchases.wood further represented that gcs had signed a joint venture agreement the joint venture with a handful of other companies united phillips communications bv,itself a joint venture between an american company and a subsidiary of a dutch company tevel israel international communications,an israeli corporation and bezeq israel telecommunications company,another israeli company pursuant to which those companies would pay gcs for the bulgarian cable television companies.
wood told marshall that deloitte slovakia was assisting gcs with certain tasks related to the acquisition,but that financing for gcs purchase of the bulgarian cable television companies had fallen through and without a replacement investor,wood might lose his job.wood told marshall that if marshall invested in the bulgarian venture,deloitte slovakia would give marshall business referrals,offer marshall future partnership in deloitte slovakia,guarantee the value of the bulgarian venture,and loan marshall the amount of his investment.wood provided various documents related to the bulgarian venture,including a valuation report prepared for gcs by deloitte slovakia the deloitte valuation and a copy of the signed joint venture agreement.
initial discussions between wood and marshall apparently took place in slovakia,and another meeting was held in israel,attended by wood,marshall,gcs chief executive officer george mainas,and others,to discuss certain aspects of the proposed transactions.on mainas invitation,marshall and wood traveled to vancouver and san francisco to negotiate marshall investment.mainas lived and worked in the san francisco area and gcs was based in vancouver.in opposition to wood renewed motion to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens,marshall alleged that gcs was operated,in substantial part,from mainas offices in california.at these meetings in june,wood reiterated his previous representations,and in reliance on these and other representations,marshall agreed to invest.in order to carry out the contemplated transactions,marshall formed plaintiff btg,which would enter into a partnership the partnership with a subsidiary of gcs.
upon their return to slovakia,marshall and wood arranged for financing,through a slovakian bank,of marshall investment.during the summer of,marshall and avraham zimmerman,a shareholder of gcs,engaged in various negotiations on behalf of the partnership for the purchase of the bulgarian cable television companies.by late august,marshall believed that the partnership agreement had been finalized,that one of the target bulgarian cable television companies had been purchased,and that an agreement had been reached with the seller as to the other one.
in september,at mainas invitation,marshall returned to vancouver for a gcs meeting.mainas asked marshall for an additional investment,allegedly because the bulgarian venture was undervalued and it would appear to gcs shareholders that mainas had sold half of gcs business opportunity to marshall at a fraction of its value.mainas,wood,marshall and zimmerman then traveled to san francisco and,over the course of about three days,negotiated an arrangement pursuant to which btg would invest an additional in the partnership.during these negotiations,wood repeated many of the same representations he had already made.based on those representations,marshall agreed to invest the additional funds,and subsequently obtained financing for that investment through the same slovakian bank.
by july,however,marshall learned that mainas,gcs and its subsidiary had not taken certain necessary steps to complete the purchases of the two bulgarian cable television companies.marshall threatened litigation against gcs,but wood continued,throughout the rest of and early,to reassure marshall that the necessary steps would be taken and that in any event,marshall investment was protected because deloitte slovakia had guaranteed it.in the spring of,wood was transferred to a job in yugoslavia with a different deloitte entity,but the parties continued to communicate by telephone.wood also continued to represent that he and deloitte slovakia were working toward completing the bulgarian venture.in reliance on wood representations,marshall did not sue gcs.
in,wood returned to deloitte slovakia.wood subsequent conduct led marshall to believe that wood was trying to intimidate him,so that he would not seek to enforce deloitte slovakia guarantee of his investment or investigate the matter further.by the end of,marshall obtained information that caused him to conclude that wood had knowingly or recklessly made a number of fundamental factual misrepresentations,including that some of the documentation marshall had received in connection with his investment was fraudulent that the joint venture had been dissolved long before wood convinced marshall to invest that the joint venture agreement contained a forged signature or had been terminated at the time wood convinced marshall to invest that wood,mainas and others had acted to deceive marshall for their own benefit and that deloitte slovakia had never intended to guarantee marshall investment.
in december,marshall filed an action in the northern district of california against wood,mainas,gcs under the name consolidated global cable systems,and deloitte touche tohmatsu,which he characterized as a swiss verein with a united states headquarters and operations in approximately countries,including slovakia,through its affiliate and agent deloitte slovakia.the complaint was amended in march to add deloitte slovakia and a handful of other entities as defendants.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on several grounds.wood moved for dismissal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that he had not been served properly.the deloitte entities moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,and wood later attempted to join those motions.mainas and gcs moved to dismiss on the grounds that there was a mandatory arbitration clause in the partnership agreement between gcs and btg.all defendants moved to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds.
in,the district court dismissed the claims against mainas and gcs in favor of arbitration,and in dismissed the claims against the deloitte entities and wood for lack of personal jurisdiction.having dismissed all claims,the district court did not address the forum non conveniens issue.
marshall appealed and we affirmed the dismissals of mainas,gcs and the deloitte entities,but reversed the dismissal of wood,reasoning that wood had waived any personal jurisdiction defense by failing to raise it at the same time he brought his rule b motion.the case was remanded to the district court,with wood the sole remaining defendant.
on remand,wood renewed his motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds.marshall opposed that motion.the district court granted wood motion to dismiss on the conditions that the courts of slovakia accept the parties agreement to toll the statute of limitations and wood accept service of process in slovakia.marshall now appeals.
we have held that a district court considering a motion for dismissal on the ground of forum non conveniens must decide 
whether defendants have made a clear showing of facts which establish such oppression and vexation of a defendant as to be out of proportion to plaintiff convenience,which may be shown to be slight or nonexistent.forum non conveniens is an exceptional tool to be employed sparingly,not a doctrine that compels plaintiffs to choose the optimal forum for their claim.

a party seeking dismissal of an action on forum non conveniens grounds must show two things the existence of an adequate alternative forum,and that the balance of private and public interest factors favors dismissal.loya starwood hotels resorts worldwide,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.here,marshall does not question the district court determination that slovakia provides an adequate alternative forum for the case,and thus we will not address that portion of the district court ruling.
marshall urges,instead,that the district court incorrectly concluded that the balance of relevant private and public interest factors favored dismissal.in weighing the relevant private and public interest factors,o rdinarily,a plaintiff choice of forum will not be disturbed unless the private interest and the public interest factors strongly favor trial in a foreign country.lueck sundstrand,cir.
we review the district court dismissal in this action with the understanding that a determination of forum non conveniens is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion where the court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors,and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable,its decision deserves substantial deference.creative,aztech,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also piper aircraft reyno,d.
we turn first to the private interest factors at issue in this case.the private interest factors to be weighed in a forum non conveniens inquiry are 
the residence of the parties and the witnesses the forum convenience to the litigants access to physical evidence and other sources of proof whether unwilling witnesses can be compelled to testify the cost of bringing witnesses to trial the enforceability of the judgment and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy,expeditious and inexpensive.

with regard to the residence of the parties,btg is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in massachusetts marshall is a united states citizen who resides in new hampshire and wood is a united states citizen.in,in support of his initial motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds,wood averred that he had been working in eastern europe,particularly in bratislava,since.in february,in support of his renewed motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds,wood stated that he was living in albania and that his wife and children,although living in north carolina,intended to move to slovakia later that year.wood averred he would divide his time between slovakia and albania after his family relocation.
the district court held that the private interest factor of the parties residences was neutral because the parties resided in neither of the potential forums california or slovakia.marshall argues that the district court failed to give proper deference to his choice of forum.although california is not marshall home forum,as he is a new hampshire resident,marshall is a united states citizen and resident suing in a united states forum.in that sense,marshall asserts,he is suing in his home forum.
we have held that the mere presence of american plaintiffs is not in and of itself sufficient to bar a district court from dismissing a case on the ground of forum non conveniens.cheng boeing,cir.moreover,in gemini capital group,yap fishing,cir gemini capital,we held that a united states citizen decision to sue in hawaii,even though he was not a hawaii resident,was properly accorded less deference than if hawaii had been his true home forum.id.at see also contact lumber moges shipping,cir.even if marshall choice of forum was due less deference than if he had been a california resident,gemini capital did not disturb our earlier admonitions that,where the plaintiff is a united states citizen,the defendant must satisfy a heavy burden of proof,lueck,at,and that unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant,the plaintiff choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.gates learjet jensen,cir,quoting manu int l,avon,cir.gemini capital did not hold that an american citizen suing in a state other than his state of residence deserves no more deference than a truly foreign plaintiff,someone who is not a united states citizen or resident.indeed,even as to such quintessentially foreign plaintiffs,it is clear that less deference is not the same thing as no deference.ravelo monegro rosa,cir.
here,the district court acknowledged that it had an obligation to afford marshall choice of forum the deference it is due,but proceeded to hold that the private interest factor of the parties residences was neutral.although marshall would stand in a stronger position were he a california resident,marshall is a citizen and resident of the united states and his choice of forum is therefore entitled to more deference than that shown by the district court.
turning to the next private interest factor,the forum convenience to the litigants,wood argued that defending an action in california would be extraordinarily burdensome and expensive for him given the difficulty communicating or meeting with his legal counsel,the expense and time required to travel between europe and california,and the possibility that he may have to retain two sets of counsel.these same considerations would apply,however,if marshall were to bring his case in slovakia.the district court properly concluded that this factor was neutral.
we next compare the ease of access to physical evidence and other sources of proof if this case is litigated in california versus slovakia.wood argues that he has no control over the documents that he intends to use in his defense,because those documents are in the custody of deloitte slovakia,which no longer employs him.wood also asserts that his defense requires access to documents located in slovakia or nearby european countries,such as documents allegedly held by other deloitte entities and by the slovakian bank that provided financing to marshall.
but if this case proceeds in california,wood may seek these documents through procedures for international discovery,such as those under the hague convention on taking of evidence abroad in civil or commercial matters.any court will necessarily face some difficulty in securing evidence from abroad,but these complications do not necessarily justify dismissal.tuazon reynolds tobacco,cir.moreover,marshall points out that many of the documents to which wood refers were prepared by deloitte slovakia on behalf of its client,gcs.it is reasonable to assume that many of such documents exist in the files of gcs or its ceo,mainas,who is a california resident.although gcs was incorporated in canada,marshall alleges that gcs business was effectively operated from mainas california offices.other key documents are in marshall custody,including the documents given to marshall containing representations about the transaction these documents may be obtained wherever marshall action proceeds.other documents pertaining to the joint to marshall claims that wood misrepresented the status of the joint likely in the custody of the other purported parties to the joint venture.those companies,according to marshall,were based in colorado,the netherlands and israel.the difficulty of obtaining those documents for a lawsuit in slovakia is likely to be equal to,or perhaps even greater than,the difficulty of obt
