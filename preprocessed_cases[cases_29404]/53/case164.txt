background 
on july,certain domestic producers of oil country tubular goods octg filed a petition with commerce alleging that got was providing countervailable subsidies to domestic exporters.borusan i,supp.at.commerce subsequently a countervailing duty investigation.certain oil country tubular goods from india and turkey,fed.reg.dep t of commerce july.although myriad arguments were presented to commerce and the trade court prior to the present appeal,we recount only those facts relevant to the appealed issues.
after institution,commerce selected borusan and got as mandatory respondents.because hrs is an input used in the manufacture of octg,commerce then issued each a questionnaire relating to the provision of hrs in turkey.as borusan and got responses different issues,we provide further factual and procedural background relating to each in turn.
in its initial questionnaire,commerce asked borusan to report its purchases of hrs during the period of investigation poi,regardless of whether borusan used the hrs to produce octg during that period.joint appendix.borusan responded that it had three production facilities during the poi gemlik,halkali,and izmit.during the poi,borusan averred that only gemlik produced subject octg and no hrs purchased for the other facilities was to gemlik.borusan only provided data for the gemlik location because only that location could have benefitted from subsidies attributable to the production or sale of the octg subject merchandise.
borusan noted that it had difficulties compiling that information.specifically,borusan contended that the process of gathering the requested data was extremely time consuming and burdensome,resulting in well over printed pages and gathering the requested data required borusan to extract the data from two different data systems.accordingly,borusan argued that requiring data for the other two locations would impose great burdens on borusan for no purpose.
commerce saw the matter differently.in a supplemental questionnaire,commerce noted that borusan did not report hrs purchases for borusan two other mills,despite the original questionnaire asking for that information.thus,commerce asked borusan to please report all of borusan purchases of hrs,including its purchases for the halkali and izmit mills.commerce did indicate,however,that if borusan was unable to provide this information,it should explain in detail why borusan could not provide this information and the efforts borusan made to provide it to commerce.
in response,borusan did not provide data for the halkali and izmit locations.instead,borusan further detailed its difficulties in compiling data for the gemlik location.borusan reiterated its statements from its initial response,explained that it had to separate manually,and that the process for gemlik alone took over two weeks of preparation by numerous members of borusan staff.thus,borusan asked commerce to take into consideration the significant burdens associated with gathering information relating to the halkali and izmit mills.
borusan then attempted to invoke c and,which provide that if an interested party notifies commerce promptly after receiving a request that it is unable to submit the information requested in the requested form and manner,together with a full explanation and suggested alternative forms,then commerce shall consider the ability of the interested party and may modify such requirements to the extent necessary to avoid imposing an unreasonable burden on that party.borusan explained that it had informed commerce of the burdens associated with the requested information,and expanded on those burdens in response to the supplemental questionnaire.borusan indicated that it believed that the gemlik data was sufficient because,in its view,the gemlik data allowed commerce to capture any possible benefit from borusan purchases that may have benefitted the production or sale of the subject octg.nevertheless,borusan indicated its intention to fully cooperate with commerce investigation and to respond to all reasonable requests for information.if commerce insist ed on full reporting of all purchases from every facility then borusan indicated that it was ready to provide that information with the understanding that it will require several weeks to do so.
commerce did not respond directly to borusan response to the supplemental questionnaire.instead,in its preliminary determination,and again in its calculation memo and final determination,commerce determined that it was appropriate to apply afa to borusan because borusan did not provide data relating to the halkali and izmit locations.certain oil country tubular goods from the republic of turkey,fed.reg,itadoc,issues decision memorandum,at dep t of commerce july,original results memo.commerce noted that it had twice requested data relating to all purchases of hrs and that borusan did not provide those data or provide evidence that they were unavailable.id.at.thus,commerce determined that borusan failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability because borusan withheld requested information on its purchases of hrs,despite having two opportunities,and never requested an extension.id.at.borusan appealed the application of afa to the trade court,which remanded to commerce for further justification of why it needed data for the halkali and izmit locations.borusan i,supp.at.
on remand,commerce determined that data on the halkali and izmit locations were necessary,and again determined that it was appropriate to apply afa given that borusan did not provide such data.see borusan ii,wl,at discussing commerce determination on remand.borusan appealed again,and the trade court determined that commerce application of afa was supported by substantial evidence because commerce request for that information was still by the time commerce reached its preliminary determination.id.at.accordingly,the trade court determined that substantial evidence supports that borusan at least shared if not bore responsibility for the state of the record,and the state of the law does not,apparently,require more of commerce.id.
commerce questionnaire to got focused more on the general state of the turkish hrs industry.specifically,commerce asked got to provide t he total volume and value of turkish domestic consumption of hrs and the total volume and value of turkish domestic production of hrs,as well as data relating to the percentage of domestic consumption accounted for by domestic production,the total volume and value of imports of hrs,and other data relevant to determining whether companies owned or effectively owned by got constituted a significant share of the market.got responded that data relating to hrs were not available,and so provided figures relating to flat steel products.got indicated that the flat steel data included coils,coils,stainless coils,and referred to those numbers to answer commerce.see.in responding to another question,however,got stated that the erdemir group produces a majority of hrs in turkey.
in its response,got also referenced a number of documents that appeared to describe government aid to the steel industry.see.accordingly,commerce asked to review those documents.got responded that the documents were produced as a result of bilateral trade agreements between turkey and the european union eu,and the process was on condition of confidentiality.moreover,got claimed that the documents requested by commerce included proprietary information of companies not subject to the investigation,and that got therefore was not able to share those documents.
in its final determination,commerce found that got exercised meaningful control over erdemir group and its subsidiary isdemir together,erdemir,and therefore that it was appropriate to treat them as government bodies.original results memo,fed.reg,itadoc,at.borusan data indicated that it had purchased hrs from erdemir accordingly,commerce turned to analyzing whether borusan had received a benefit in making those purchases by comparing the price borusan paid to other prices.id.at.
commerce generally prefers to compare prices paid to actual transactions in the country in question.see a i.if the market in that country is distorted by government involvement,however,then commerce will consider the prices paid in that country as not an appropriate basis of comparison,preamble duties final rule,fed.reg,dep t of commerce,the preamble,and will instead look to world market prices,a i.
commerce began here by determining whether the turkish hrs market was distorted.commerce noted that got averred that hrs production and consumption data were unavailable for the poi,and that the flat steel data included many products.original results memo,fed.reg,itadoc,at.commerce relied upon import statistics for coil and proprietary business information,however,to find that domestic turkish production of hrs accounted for a majority of the total supply inclusive of imports in turkey during the poi and previous two years.id.commerce also noted that got had admitted that erdemir accounts for the majority of hrs production in turkey.id.at.because domestic production accounted for a majority of total supply and erdemir accounted for a majority of domestic production,commerce found that erdemir accounted for,at a minimum,a substantial portion of the domestic market,and so the level of government involvement in the market was such that prices would be significantly distorted.id.
in reaching that conclusion,commerce cited the preamble,which states that commerce recognizes that while government involvement in a market may have some impact on the price of the good or service in that market,such distortion will normally be minimal unless the government provider constitutes a majority or,in certain circumstances,a substantial portion of the market.preamble,fed.reg.at.accordingly,commerce determined that prices paid in turkey could not be of the government price,and used world prices to determine that borusan had received a countervailable subsidy of percent.original results memo,fed.reg,itadoc,at.
along with the application of afa,borusan appealed to the trade court commerce finding that the turkish market was distorted.the trade court vacated commerce finding of distortion and remanded for further explanation.borusan i,supp.at.the trade court explained that commerce finding required further explanation because the preamble indicates that distortion will normally be minimal unless the government provider constitutes a majority or,in certain circumstances,a substantial portion of the market commerce had concluded that erdemir only controlled a substantial portion of the market and commerce had not cited any actual evidence of market distortion or explained the certain circumstances giving rise to its finding.id.at citing preamble,fed.reg.at.the case was consolidated for remand with another case involving toscelik profil ve sac endustrisi and cayirova boru sanayi ve ticaret together,toscelik,other turkish companies subject to similar claims by domestic industry litigants.borusan ii,wl,at.
on remand,commerce agreed that the language in the preamble does suggest a possible limitation on commerce analysis to certain circumstances when a substantial portion of the market is at issue,but does not suggest the same constraint when the government constitutes a majority of the market.see remand results,slip op.at.in the present case,however,commerce averred that the data suggest the possibility that the government provider in this case might,in fact,have constituted a majority of the market.id.commerce noted that the record evidence on this point is incomplete because got did not respond fully and comprehensively to commerce requests for information,id.at,and argued that it never found that erdemir accounted for less than a majority of the turkish hrs market instead,it was commerce cautious conclusion based on the limited data on the record,id.at.thus,commerce indicated that it was conducting its distortion analysis on remand under protest for two reasons.first,because the situation was different from one in which the record information shows definitely that government providers account for less than the majority of the market for a good.id.at.second,commerce did not have relevant information because got did not provide it.id.at.
even though commerce noted that the got was being rewarded for not providing relevant information,id.at,commerce refused to apply afa to got,id.at.commerce noted that got stated that documents containing other relevant information could not be shared because of confidentiality agreements.id.at.as to the hrs production information,commerce expressed that although it seems highly unlikely that the got would be unable to gather information on domestic steel production in turkey,there is no evidence on the record which would contradict the got claim.id.at.commerce also concluded that reassessing got failure to provide data was outside of the scope of the remand order from the trade court.id.
when it performed its analysis,commerce determined that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that erdemir accounted for a majority of the hrs market.id.at.commerce also determined that there was no evidence of the type of government controls that had led it to a conclusion of market distortion in past cases.id.at.as it found that there was no evidence of market distortion in the record,commerce then recalculated borusan countervailable subsidy using turkish transactions to be percent.id.at.
the trade court affirmed.borusan ii,wl,at.it reasoned that,notwithstanding commerce protests,neither commerce nor maverick could identify any dispositive evidence of market distortion,and nothing indicated that got was not being truthful regarding its access to data or the confidentiality requirements.id.at.given the evidence in the record,the trade court concluded that substantial evidence supported commerce finding of no distortion and its decision not to apply afa to got.id.
borusan timely appealed and maverick timely.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
in appeals from the trade court,we apply the same standard of review that it applies,upholding commerce determinations unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i.a finding is supported by substantial evidence if a reasonable mind might accept the evidence as sufficient to support the finding.consol.edison of nlrb.although we review the decisions of the trade court de novo,we give great weight to the informed opinion of the trade court,and it is nearly always the starting point of our analysis.ningbo dafa chem.fiber united states,fed.cir.internal quotation marks,brackets,and citations omitted.
borusan appeal 
borusan argues that commerce decision to apply afa is unsupported by substantial evidence and contrary to law because commerce must consider difficulties encountered by an interested party in responding to requests and modify requirements to avoid imposing an unreasonable burden.see borusan br.citing c.b
