when the united states court of international trade reached a final decision in a complex case involving antidumping liquidation procedures for imports,both united states and appellant consolidated bearings company consolidated appealed.consolidated bearings united states,cit july,consolidated iv.after finding it possessed jurisdiction,consolidated bearings company united states,d cit consolidated i,the trial court decision in consolidated iv affirmed the united states department of commerce commerce april,final results of redetermination pursuant to court remand remand ii 
because no other subsection of was or could have been a basis for jurisdiction in this case,trial court was correct in finding jurisdiction under section i.in addition,this court agrees with the trial court holding that the exhaustion doctrine does not apply in this case,but does not agree that the pure question of law exception applies.finally,because the court of international trade erred in interpreting a c,this court vacates the judgment below and remands for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
commerce issues antidumping duty orders for imported merchandise that is sold in the united states below its fair value and materially injures or threatens to injure a domestic industry.see.these antidumping duties reflect the difference between the foreign exporter sales price and the domestic price of the merchandise.see a.upon entry of merchandise covered by an antidumping order,an importer must make a cash deposit of estimated duties cash deposit rate.see a.
under commerce accounting system,the actual liquidation of entries subject to an antidumping order may occur years after importation.before final liquidation,any interested party may request an administrative review of the antidumping duty order.see.the final results of such a review shall be the basis for the assessment of countervailing or antidumping duties on entries of merchandise covered by the determination and for deposits of estimated duties.a c.without a request for administrative review,commerce liquidates the merchandise at the cash deposit rates,the deposit rates at the time of entry.see c i.
in,commerce issued antidumping duty orders on antifriction bearings afbs from germany.see antidumping duty orders ball bearings,cylindrical roller bearings,and spherical plain bearings and parts thereof from the federal republic of germany.may,the orders.between and,consolidated purchased and imported afbs manufactured in germany by fag kugelfischer georg schaefer kgaa fag.consolidated did not purchase the afbs directly from fag.rather,consolidated imported the afbs from an unrelated foreign reseller.upon importation of the afbs under the orders,consolidated paid cash deposits of estimated duties based on the rates assigned to the manufacturer fag.
in,various domestic importers of afbs manufactured by fag requested an administrative review.commerce initiated the review on june,and published its final results on july,consolidated did not request or participate in the administrative review.after the court of international trade adjudicated some challenges to those final results,commerce issued its amended final results the final results under these final results,each participating importer of afbs received a new specific duty rate.information concerning consolidated imports and the reseller that exports to consolidated was not presented to commerce in the administrative review.
in september,the united states customs service customs received liquidation instructions from commerce.these instructions implemented the final results for the liquidation of afb entries for the participating importers the instructions.because consolidated was not a party to the administrative review,the final results did not contain a new antidumping rate specifically for consolidated or the reseller that exports to consolidated.on august,customs again implemented liquidation instructions from commerce.these instructions directed customs to liquidate all entries of afbs from germany that had not been liquidated by the instructions.under the instructions,customs liquidated the remaining merchandise at the cash deposit rate in effect at the time of entry.these instructions required liquidation of consolidated entries at the cash deposit rates,which were much higher than the rates for the participating importers under the final results.
consequently,consolidated brought this action to challenge the instructions and compel commerce to apply the antidumping rates in the final results to consolidated entries of afbs from germany.specifically,consolidated contends that commerce should apply to consolidated entries a rate equal to a of the rates established in the final results for afbs.in consolidated i,the court of international trade found jurisdiction,found no violation of the exhaustion doctrine,entered judgment on the merits in favor of consolidated,and remanded the case for commerce to reassess the antidumping duty.d at.the court of international trade ultimately affirmed commerce actions in remand ii.see consolidated vi,at.
the court of international trade invalidated the instructions as an unlawful correction or modification of the instructions.see consolidated ii,d at.commerce expressed its opinion that the trial court was in error.nevertheless,to comply with the remand order,commerce annulled the instructions and used the ad valorem rates in the instructions from the final results for liquidation of consolidated afb imports.in this appeal,commerce challenges the trial court judgment on the merits in consolidated i,and consolidated challenges the trial court affirmance of commerce second remand determination in remand ii.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.
subject matter jurisdiction 
this court reviews the trial court subject matter jurisdiction ruling as a legal determination without deference.see jcm,united states.consolidated sought jurisdiction under title residual jurisdiction provision 
t he court of international trade shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced against the united states,its agencies,or its officers,that arises out of any law of the united states providing for 
revenue from imports or tonnage 
tariffs,duties,fees,or other taxes on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the raising of revenue 
embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the protection of the public health or safety or 
administration and enforcement with respect to the matters referred to in paragraphs of this subsection and subsections a h of this section.
this subsection shall not confer jurisdiction over an antidumping or countervailing duty determination which is reviewable either by the court of international trade under section a of the tariff act of.
i.section i subsection i supplies jurisdiction only for instances when no other subsection of that section is or could have been available,unless the other subsection provided no more than a manifestly inadequate remedy.foods,united states,quoting miller united states,cert.denied,d.
commerce contends that c subsection c could have been available to establish jurisdiction in this case if consolidated had participated in the administrative review that produced the final results.subsection c grants the court of international trade jurisdiction over actions brought under section of the tariff act of,which includes challenges to the final results of an administrative review by a participant in that review.see c a b iii.subsection i specifically states that t his subsection shall not confer jurisdiction over an antidumping or countervailing duty determination which is reviewable by the court of international trade under section a of the tariff act of.i.according to commerce,consolidated can not maintain this action under subsection i because it could have brought the same action under subsection c if it had joined the administrative review process.in other words,commerce asks this court to bar consolidated from jurisdiction under subsection i because it did not participate in the administrative review.
consolidated,however,did not bring this action to challenge the final results of the administrative review.if that were the case,commerce position might have more merit.consolidated does not object to the final results.rather consolidated seeks application of those final results to its entries of afbs manufactured by fag.this case involves a challenge to the instructions,which is not an action defined under section of the tariff act.stated otherwise,in this action,consolidated challenges the instructions as a violation of a c and as a departure from commerce past practice of liquidation.because consolidated is not challenging the final results,subsection c is not and could not have been a source of jurisdiction for this case.
in addition to finding this case outside the jurisdictional grants in subsection c,this court finds this case squarely within the provisions of subsection i.commerce liquidation instructions direct customs to implement the final results of administrative reviews.consequently,an action challenging commerce liquidation instructions is not a challenge to the final results,but a challenge to the administration and enforcement of those final results.thus,consolidated challenges the manner in which commerce administered the final results.section i grants jurisdiction to such an action.
moreover,liquidation instructions direct customs to impose antidumping duties to protect domestic markets.as a result,an action against those instructions also arises as a challenge to tariffs,duties,fees,or other taxes on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the raising of revenue.i.this court,therefore,concludes that the trial court correctly asserted jurisdiction under i and.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
proper subject matter jurisdiction does not finish the jurisdictional inquiry.in the court of international trade,a plaintiff must also show that it exhausted its administrative remedies,or that it qualifies for an exception to the exhaustion doctrine.see d the court of international trade shall,where appropriate,require the exhaustion of administrative remedies.while enforcing exhaustion requirements as jurisdictional prerequisites,the court of international trade also enjoys discretion to identify circumstances where exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply.see cemex,united states.
generally,t he doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies provides that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.mckart united states,d quoting myers bethlehem shipbuilding.if a party does not exhaust available administrative remedies,judicial review of commerce actions is inappropriate.sharp united states.over the years,the court of international trade has identified various exceptions to the exhaustion requirement.for instance,in the proceedings below,the trial court identified various exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine,including the futility exception and the pure question of law exception.see consolidated i,d at.ultimately,the court applied the pure question of law exception to this case.see consolidated i,d at.
the trial court accepted consolidated view that this case presents a pure legal issue that requires only an examination of a it does not require the application of any special expertise from commerce for the development of a special factual record either before or after the court consideration of the issue.id.consolidated,however,did not argue only that requires commerce to apply the final results to its afb entries.in addition,consolidated argues that commerce violated its prior practice of applying the final results of administrative reviews to importers who did not participate in the review,but import the same merchandise from resellers without their own established antidumping rates.thus consolidated alleged that commerce arbitrarily changed its practice and contravened the reasonable expectations of importers.these allegations require a factual record of commerce past practice and an assessment of commerce justifications for any departure from that past practice.statutory construction alone is not sufficient to resolve this case.accordingly,this court finds that this case does not qualify for the pure question of law exception to the exhaustion doctrine.
nevertheless,this court finds that consolidated did not fail to exhaust its administrative remedies.because,as noted earlier,consolidated challenges liquidation instruction practices and not the administrative review itself,its failure to participate in the administrative review does not preclude judicial review.indeed,the united states could not identify any administrative process available to challenge liquidation instructions issued by commerce.the record in this case does not disclose any statutory or regulatory provision that allows a party to challenge the manner in which commerce implements the final results of an administrative review.without an administrative procedure to exhaust,this court holds that consolidated did not violate the exhaustion doctrine.thus,the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over the merits of this action.
requirements of a c 
turning to the merits,this court will apply the standard of review set forth in to an action instituted pursuant to i.humane soc y of the united states clinton.in other words,this court reviews the trial court decision de novo,reapplying the same standard utilized by that court.section of title of the united states code states 
to the extent necessary to decision and when presented,the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law,interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.the reviewing court shall 
compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed and 
hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be 
a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law 
b contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity 
c in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or short of statutory right 
d without observance of procedure required by law 
e unsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to sections and of this title or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute or 
f unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to trial de novo by the reviewing court.
the court of international trade dismissed consolidated allegations that commerce,by issuing the instructions,violated consolidated fifth amendment due process rights and the procedural requirements of the administrative procedure act.consolidated i,d at.consolidated does not those arguments on appeal.therefore,commerce liquidation instructions in this case will only be set aside if found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
the trial court determined that commerce instructions both violated a c and arbitrarily departed from its established past practice.turning first to the alleged statutory violation,this court reviews statutory interpretation without deference.see lynteq,united states.the court of international trade held that the framework of section a does not permit commerce to reassess antidumping duties after an administrative review and issuance of instructions to implement the results of that review.according to the trial court,the instructions were an unlawful modification of the rates applied by the instructions.
section sets forth the framework for an administrative review of antidumping duties.this section clearly places the focus of the administrative review on the entry of merchandise.for example,section a a requires commerce to determine the normal value and export price or constructed export price of each entry of subject merchandise,and the dumping margin for each such entry.a a emphases added.
thus,antidumping duties ensure that each import reflects correct market values.once the review sets the market valu
