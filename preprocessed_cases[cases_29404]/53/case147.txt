this is an appeal from an order granting a petition of the united states international trade commission for enforcement of its subpoena for the production of documents under section b of the tariff act of,b.asat,challenges enforcement on the grounds that the district court lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction,was not the proper venue,and,alternatively,erred by refusing to review whether asat,controlled the subpoenaed documents that are in its parent companies possession.although we hold that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction and was a proper venue,and that because section b of the tariff act of authorizes nationwide service of process,it also had personal jurisdiction over asat,we nonetheless reverse the order enforcing the administrative subpoena because the record lacks sufficient evidence to determine,as a matter of law,that asat,controls,and therefore is able to produce,the subpoenaed documents.
the subpoena underlying this appeal was issued during an investigation by the united states international trade commission under section of the tariff act of,of whether the importation of certain encapsulated integrated circuits by carsem,carsem m sdn bhd,and carsem semiconductor sdn bhd collectively carsem infringes three united states patents owned by amkor technology,amkor.see in matter of certain encapsulated integrated circuit devices products containing same,inv.at the request of carsem,an administrative law judge alj issued three identical subpoenas seeking documents and depositions from asat,asat limited,and asat holdings,to the investigation that allegedly have documents relative to carsem likely affirmative defenses.asat,is a california corporation with headquarters in pleasanton,california.it is a subsidiary of both asat limited,which is a hong kong corporation with a principal office in hong kong,and asat holdings,which is a cayman islands holding corporation with a principal office in hong kong.asat limited is itself also a subsidiary of asat holdings.asat,principal activities are the selling,marketing,and provision of customer services for its parent companies integrated circuits in the united states.carsem served each subpoena on asat,in california.the subpoena duces tecum requested a range of technical and legal documents relating to,among other things,the prosecution and licensing of two that is assigned to asat limited and one that is assigned to amkor.
asat limited and asat holdings moved to quash the subpoenas for improper service,and the alj granted the motion because carsem ha d not shown a lack of corporate separateness among the three asat entities and asat,was not a registered agent to accept service on their behalf.asat,also objected to its subpoena on various grounds,including that it did not have possession,custody or control of,or the legal right to obtain,certain documents because they were in the possession of asat limited or asat holdings.the alj,noting that asat,is the exclusive distributor of asat holdings services in the united states,found that there was a close business relationship between the three asats and ruled that asat is deemed to be in control of documents held by asat limited and asat holdings.
after asat,partially complied with the subpoena but advised carsem that it was unable to obtain the relevant documents from asat limited and asat holdings relating to the arrangement between asat holdings and amkor on the patents in question,carsem moved to certify to the commission a request for judicial enforcement of the subpoena.the alj agreed,stating that the information sought in the subpoena relates to communications between asat and amkor and the prosecution of the asat and amkor patents that is relevant to carsem affirmative defense and for which there is no other source.the alj understood asat flat refusal to comply with the subpoena as a showing of contempt for the commission discovery processes.the commission granted the alj request,and,on august,it filed a petition in the district court for the district of columbia to enforce the subpoena.the district court granted the petition,ruling that it had jurisdiction and that none of asat,substantive challenges to the administrative subpoena fell within the court limited scope of review.int l trade comm asat,d.the district court stayed its enforcement order,which is a final appealable order,see ftc texaco,en banc,and asat,now appeals.
section b of the tariff act provides that the commission may require the attendance of witnesses and the production of such documentary evidence from any place in the united states at any designated place of hearing.b.significantly,the subsection further provides 
i n case of disobedience to a subpoena the commission may invoke the aid of any district or territorial court of the united states in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence and such court within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on may,in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any corporation or other person,issue an order requiring such corporation or other person to appear before the commission,or to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence touching the matter in question.
id.emphasis added.the question whether the district court has subject matter jurisdiction over an action is generally distinct from the question whether it was a proper venue in which the action could be filed.see neirbo bethlehem shipbuilding.wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.supp.mun.power agency epa,new mexico ex rel.energy minerals dep t dep t of interior.the former addresses the power of the court to adjudicate,while the latter addresses the place where that judicial authority may be exercised and focuses on the convenience to the parties of the location of the lawsuit.neirbo,at.however,in the context of section b of the tariff act,the two inquiries merge.under the analysis adopted in fec committee to elect lyndon larouche,the district court subject matter jurisdiction under section b turns on whether the commission inquiry was carried on in the judicial district in which the commission filed its enforcement action,b.in this instance,the court is required to determine whether the district of columbia bore a sufficiently reasonable relation to the subject matter of the investigation to qualify as a place where the inquiry was carried on,and whether the commission choice of this jurisdiction as its place of inquiry exceeded the bound of reasonableness.larouche,at quoting ftc macarthur,cir internal citation omitted.because the second criterion resembles a traditional venue analysis that focuses on the convenience of the forum to the parties,see neirbo,at,it may more properly be said that the first larouche criterion implicates the district court subject matter jurisdiction,while the second criterion implicates whether that court is a proper venue.indeed,in light of steel citizens for a better environment,d,it may be that section b is properly viewed not as jurisdictional but as only implicating the district court remedial power.the court suggested,in dictum,in united states hill,where there was no enforcement provision in the agency statute at issue,that the general jurisdictional grants in,provide the district court with subject matter jurisdiction over actions to enforce administrative subpoenas.however,because it is not so clear that steel is inconsistent with the characterization of similar statutory language in larouche and ftc browning,this court has no occasion to adopt a different analysis.see lashawn barry,en banc.
asat,contends that the phrase such court within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry should be interpreted to include only the location of the attendance of witnesses and the production of such documentary evidence,b,and it should not be understood to encompass the broader investigation into carsem alleged infringing practices.while the use of the terms investigation and inquiry in section could suggest that the two terms are not synonymous,but see ftc jim walter,cir,abrogated on other grounds by ins.of ireland compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d,asat,interpretation ignores the commission efforts under section b to obtain the attendance of witnesses and the production of such documentary evidence that occur outside of the jurisdiction where the subpoena is directed.asat,provides no justification for such a confined construction of what constitutes the commission inquiry,and our caselaw indicates that the place where the subpoena is returnable is not determinative of the place of inquiry,see larouche,at.thus,asat,contention that the northern district of california is the only district that has jurisdiction to enforce the commission subpoena because that is the location where the commission sought the production of documents must fail.
instead t he test whether the commission is undertaking an inquiry in a particular place is whether the place and the activities occurring there bear a reasonable relation to the subject matter of the investigation.macarthur,at.among the factors relevant to this determination are the place where the commission held its hearing,the place where it made the decision to authorize the investigation,the place where the subpoenas were issued,the place where its correspondence emanated,the place where the commission determined that unlawful actions had occurred,the location of the documents and witnesses,and the location of the headquarters of the subpoenaed company.see larouche,at macarthur,at browning,at.this test is based on our precedent,and it is consistent with the commission broad investigatory powers,see,macarthur,at.
asat,attempts to define the inquiry narrowly and to minimize the commission activities within the district of columbia relating to it,but the district court had subject matter jurisdiction because the district of columbia,where the commission maintains its headquarters,was the hub of the commission investigative activity of carsem importation of certain encapsulated circuits.larouche,at.even if we were to ignore,as asat,suggests,that the alj evidentiary hearing regarding carsem actions was held in the district of columbia,the commission activities regarding the subpoena at issue were conducted overwhelmingly in the district of columbia the subpoena was signed,sealed,and issued in the district of columbia,the alj rulings on asat motion to quash were issued in the district of columbia,and the commission certification of the subpoena for judicial enforcement occurred in the district of columbia.because,as the district court stated,the commission conducted the administrative activities essential to the investigation in the district of columbia,asat,d at,the district court here had subject matter jurisdiction under section b of the tariff act,see larouche,at macarthur,at.
although these wholly administrative activities may occur in the district of columbia in most,if not all,commission inquiries and therefore the district court for the district of columbia often,if not always,would have subject matter jurisdiction,contrary to asat contention,this reality does not rewrite the statute to substitute the district court for the district of columbia in place of such court within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on in section b.instead,as the commission notes,it is not required to hold hearings in the district of columbia.rather,while the tariff act establishes the commission principal office in the district of columbia,d,it also authorizes the commission to maintain an office in new york,id.e,and to prosecute any inquiry necessary to its duties in any part of the united states,id.d.and,while the district court for the district of columbia may have subject matter jurisdiction when the commission conducts its administrative actions here,our precedent is clear that an inquiry can be carried on in more than one place.see larouche,at browning,at.as long as the factors derived from larouche,macarthur,and browning so indicate,it properly can be said that an inquiry is carried on in that place,and the district court in that judicial district has subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the commission subpoena.
asat,challenge to venue focuses on the reasonableness of the commission selection of the district court for the district of columbia to seek enforcement of its administrative subpoena.it makes no statutory claim that,as a to an administrative proceeding,it can determine the place of enforcement.neirbo,at.publ g murphree.instead,its principal concern is that it is being forced to defend its actions in remote jurisdictions.br.of appellant at.however,asat,has demonstrated no actual hardship of defending itself in the district of columbia,especially since it already had participated in administrative proceedings in the district of columbia.hence,it is not difficult to conclude that the commission choice of the district of columbia to enforce the subpoena is the bound of reasonableness.larouche,at quoting macarthur,at internal quotation marks omitted.
asat,challenge to the personal jurisdiction of the district court is similarly unavailing.rule k of the federal rules of civil procedure,as relevant,authorizes service of process consistent with the statute of the state or the district of columbia,see fed.civ.e in which the district court sits or as otherwise provided by federal law.the commission does not maintain that the district of columbia statutes,code ann,authorized service of process on asat,in california,but it instead contends that section b of the tariff act,which permits enforcement of commission subpoenas by district or territorial courts within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on,b,authorizes nationwide service of process in actions to enforce commission subpoenas.
on two occasions the court has confronted identical or strikingly similar language in other statutes and concluded that congress intended to imply nationwide service of process.in browning,the court interpreted the identical language of section of the federal trade commission act,and held that 
by granting the power to enforce subpoenas only to those district courts within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on,section so limits the place of suit for enforcement of federal trade commission subpoenas as to require an implied grant of authority for service of process in order to effectuate the purpose of the regulatory scheme.
browning,at.similarly,in larouche,the court held that the reasoning of the browning decision was equally applicable to virtually identical language in the federal election campaign act of,at,where congress had limited jurisdiction for actions to enforce federal election commission subpoenas to district courts within the jurisdiction of which any inquiry is being carried on,b.
thus,with such similar statutory language in the tariff act and the commission nationwide jurisdiction to conduct investigations,browning and larouche compel the conclusion that nationwide service of process exists for subpoena enforcement actions under section b of the tariff act.asat,contends,however,that the supreme court decision in omni capital int l rudolf wolff,d,alters this analysis.in omni capital,the court held that the commodity exchange act did not authorize nationwide service of process for private causes of action under that statute.that decision,however,does not undermine the commission position that the tariff act provides nationwide service of process for subpoena enforcement actions.
first,in omni capital,the supreme court found it significant that although the commodity exchange act provision authorizing a private cause of action was silent as to service of process,other enforcement provisions in the statute expressly provided for nationwide service of process.id.at.with the commodity exchange act,all congress had to do was use the same language it had used in other sections within the same statute to indicate its desire for nationwide service of process its failure to do so was strong evidence of its intent not to authorize nationwide service of process.see id.at.the same can not be said of the tariff act,where congress has been completely silent as to service of process.silence throug
