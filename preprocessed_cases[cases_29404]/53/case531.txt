as the successor to teknika,fujitsu initiated three protests with respect to customs liquidation of the entries fujitsu challenged the liquidation of the entries as untimely and the assessment of interest on the antidumping duties found to be due as unlawful.after customs denied all three protests,fujitsu brought suit in the court of international trade.fujitsu contended that customs had improperly failed to liquidate the entries within six months of having received notice that the injunction against liquidation had been removed.according to fujitsu,pursuant to d that resulted in the entries being deemed liquidated at the rate of duty asserted on entry.fujitsu also renewed its challenge to the assessment of interest.on for summary judgment,the court of international trade granted summary judgment in favor of the united states.the court held that,as far as fujitsu first and second protests were concerned,it lacked jurisdiction to consider whether the entries at issue were deemed liquidated under section d.the court based its ruling on the fact that the deemed liquidation claims had not been raised before customs by protest within days of the challenged liquidations,as required by c.fujitsu,united states,d.int l trade fujitsu.next,the court of international trade addressed the deemed liquidation claim in fujitsu third protest.the court found that the claim had been timely raised in the protest.on the merits,the court determined that since the liquidation challenged in the protest had occurred less than six months after customs received notice to liquidate the entries at issue,the entries were not deemed liquidated under section d.id.at.finally,the court upheld the assessment of interest on the antidumping duties that had been found to be due.fujitsu now appeals from the court decision.we affirm 
background 
the pertinent facts are not in dispute.as noted,the color televisions that were imported by fujitsu were subject to an antidumping duty.see.during the relevant period,antidumping duties assessed on color televisions from japan were subject to periodic review by the united states department of commerce commerce.a.after each review,duties were assessed retroactively on the entries covered by the review,and future entries became subject to a deposit requirement at the dumping rate calculated in the review.id.
in a series of periodic reviews published between and,commerce found the dumping margin for the color televisions imported by fujitsu to be either zero or de minimis.see television receiving sets,monochrome and color,from japan.dep t commerce,june,television receiving sets,monochrome and color,from japan.dep t commerce,june,television receiving sets,monochrome and color,from japan.dep t commerce.thereafter,in a subsequent review published on february,commerce calculated a dumping margin of.television receiving sets,monochrome and color,from japan.dep t commerce.as a result of these reviews,the televisions imported by fujitsu during the period from march,until february,required no cash deposit,while televisions imported by fujitsu between february and march,required a cash deposit of.however,customs did not liquidate the march,entries at issue at the above rates,since the administrative review process had been initiated with respect to the entries.fujitsu,d at.
on february,commerce published the results of the administrative review that had been initiated with respect to the entries.television receiving sets,monochrome and color,from japan.dep t commerce.in that review,commerce calculated a dumping margin for the entries of.fujitsu general,the manufacturer of the televisions,challenged the dumping margin determination by bringing an action in the court of international trade under a b iii.pursuant to c,the court promptly enjoined commerce from liquidating the entries during the pendency of the litigation.see fujitsu,d at.in due course,the court granted commerce request to remand the case for a recalculation of the dumping margin.after commerce reduced the dumping margin for the entries from to in its remand determination,the court affirmed the modified results of the administrative review.see fujitsu united states.int l trade.thereafter,on july,this court affirmed the court of international trade approval of commerce dumping margin determination.see fujitsu united states,fujitsu general.the court mandate issued on august,and fujitsu general time to petition for certiorari to the united states supreme court expired on october.see fujitsu,d at c.
on september,commerce published notice of the fujitsu general decision in the federal register.see.dep t commerce.ten days later,on september,commerce sent customs an instructing it to liquidate the entries at the affirmed dumping margin.pursuant to those instructions,customs liquidated the entries on multiple occasions between november of and february of.
fujitsu filed three separate protests of the liquidations,under.first,on february,fujitsu filed protest protest,challenging customs assessment of interest in connection with the liquidation of entries on november,and december.see fujitsu,d at.one month later,customs denied the protest.see id.at.thereafter,on april,fujitsu sent customs a letter in which it sought to supplement protest with a claim that the protested liquidations were improper because the entries previously had been deemed liquidated at the rate and amount of duties asserted at the time of entry more than a decade earlier.see id.customs acknowledged receipt of the letter but refused to reconsider its denial of protest.see fujitsu,d at.
on february,the same day it filed protest,fujitsu filed protest protest.in protest,fujitsu challenged customs assessment of interest on entries liquidated on november.see id.thereafter,on march,before customs had ruled on protest,fujitsu supplemented the protest.as in the case of protest,fujitsu sought to add the claim that the challenged liquidation was unlawful because the entries were already deemed liquidated.see id.on april,customs denied protest.see id.
finally,on march,fujitsu filed protest protest.in that protest,fujitsu challenged customs assessment of interest in connection with the liquidation of entries on february.see id.subsequently,on april,fujitsu supplemented protest with a deemed liquidation claim.fujitsu sent its april,letter alleging deemed liquidation before customs had ruled on protest,and,unlike the deemed liquidation claims filed in connection with protests and,within ninety days of the protested liquidation.see id.customs denied protest on april.
fujitsu filed suit in the court of international trade to contest the denial of its protests in due course,the parties for summary judgment.thereafter,in an opinion issued on august,the court of international trade denied fujitsu motion and granted the government.the court held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the deemed liquidation claims asserted in connection with protests and because the claims had not been timely raised before customs.see fujitsu,d at.as far as protest was concerned,the court held that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the deemed liquidation claim relating to the february,entries because fujitsu had timely raised the claim before customs.the court rejected the claim on the merits,however.the court concluded that customs had liquidated the entries at issue within six months of receiving notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation that had been in effect pending the litigation involving the final results of the administrative review,as required by d see id.at.fujitsu timely appealed the court ruling.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
fujitsu appeal challenges two rulings of the court of international trade.the first ruling is the court holding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the deemed liquidation claims relating to protests and,because fujitsu failed to timely protest either the liquidations of november and december,protest,or the liquidation of november,protest.the second ruling is the court holding that the entries whose liquidation fujitsu challenged in protest were not deemed liquidated at the rate of duty asserted on entry.
both the jurisdictional ruling relating to protests and and the merits ruling relating to protest were based upon the court of international trade interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions.we review the court interpretation of those statutory provisions de novo.see vwp of,united states.in part i below,we address the jurisdictional issues relating to the deemed liquidation claims asserted in connection with protests and.in part ii,we address the merits of the deemed liquidation claim in protest.
a.the jurisdictional scheme 
the jurisdiction of the court of international trade is set forth in.the two provisions of the statute that are relevant to this case are sections a and i.
under section a,the court of international trade has exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced to contest the denial of a protest,in whole or in part,under section of the tariff act of.section is codified at.section provides for customs review and subsequent allowance or denial of protests that are filed in accordance with.a.section a lists the decisions of customs that may be the subject of protests.included are decisions relating to the liquidation or reliquidation of an entry.a.section a states that a customs decision that may be the subject of a protest shall be final and conclusive upon all persons unless a protest is filed in accordance with this section.the time for filing a protest of a decision described in section a is within ninety days after notice of liquidation.c.we have held that the court of international trade authority to hear a claim under section a depends upon the importer raising the claim in a valid protest filed with customs within the prescribed period,or alternatively,in a protest coming within an exception that excuses a failure to meet the deadline.see juice farms,united states.
section i provides in pertinent part as follows 
in addition to the jurisdiction conferred upon the court of international trade by subsection a of this section,the court of international trade shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced against the united states that arises out of any law of the united states providing for administration and enforcement with respect to the matters referred to in subsection a of this section.
we have described section i as embodying a residual grant of jurisdiction,conoco,united states zones,and we have stated that s ection i jurisdiction may not be invoked when jurisdiction under another subsection of is or could have been available,unless the remedy provided under that other subsection would be manifestly inadequate.foods,united states,quoting miller united states.
whether,under a,the court of international trade had jurisdiction over the claim relating to protest 
fujitsu points to a and argues that the court of international trade erred in holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the deemed liquidation claim relating to protest as just seen,subsection c of section requires that an importer file a protest challenging a customs decision within days of receiving notice of liquidation.on february,fujitsu timely filed protest,challenging customs assessment of interest on the duties due on the entries liquidated on november.however,it submitted the letter raising its deemed liquidation claim on march,more than ninety days after liquidation.see fujitsu,d at.consequently,unless the deemed liquidation claim came within a recognized exception to the deadline prescribed by section c,the court of international trade lacked authority to review the claim under section a.
fujitsu attempts to avail itself of such an exception by arguing that its deemed liquidation claim was a new ground in support of the original protest.the new ground exception to the filing requirement in c is found in c.section c provides in relevant part that n ew grounds in support of objections raised by a valid protest may be presented for consideration in connection with the review of such protest pursuant to section of this title at any time prior to the disposition of the protest in accordance with that section.
in pagoda trading united states,we explained that in order for a supplemental deemed liquidation claim to qualify as a new ground in support of a timely protest,the timely protest must be sufficient to advise customs that liquidation is being challenged,and the deemed liquidation claim must be raised before customs rules on the protest.id.at.applying the pagoda standard,fujitsu asserts that its timely protest of the assessment of interest put customs on notice that the liquidation of entries on november,was being challenged.it also asserts,and it is undisputed,that its march,filing of the deemed liquidation claim predated customs april,rejection of the protest.therefore,fujitsu argues,its deemed liquidation claim constituted a new ground in support of its timely protests of the assessment of interest.accordingly,the court of international trade erred in failing to consider it under a.
we are unable to agree with fujitsu.in pagoda,we stated that,in order to qualify as a new ground in support of a protest,a supplemental claim must challenge the same decisions as those challenged in the original protest.at.the need to determine whether two claims challenge the same customs decision,thus permitting the supplemental claim to satisfy the requirements for a new ground,follows from the language of a.section a sets forth the protestable decisions of the customs service.in doing so,it lists all charges or exactions in section a separately from the liquidation or reliquidation of an entry in section a in other words,the statute identifies charge or exaction decisions,such as the interest assessments in this case,as separate and distinct from liquidation decisions.
the conclusion that interest assessments and liquidations involve different customs decisions for purposes of section is supported by new zealand lamb united states.at issue in that case were eight entries of lamb meat by new zealand lamb.customs effected final liquidation of six of the entries on december,and two of the entries on december.when it did so,it determined that countervailing duties were due in an amount greater than what had been deposited for estimated duties.it therefore assessed such additional duties when it liquidated the two sets of entries.id.at.subsequently,on march,customs billed new zealand lamb for interest on the additional duties.the billing came days after the six december,liquidations and days after the december,liquidations.on june,exactly ninety days after it was billed for the interest,new zealand lamb filed a protest with customs pursuant to c,in which it challenged the assessment of interest.id.at.
in new zealand lamb,we considered whether the protest of customs assessment of interest on the countervailing duties,which was filed more than ninety days after liquidation but within ninety days of the interest assessment,was timely under c.we held that the protest was timely.in so holding,we rejected the government argument that,by operation of,the eight liquidations for increased countervailing duties amounted to assessments of interest,irrespective of whether interest was mentioned in the bulletin notices liquidating the entries id.at.we noted that interest on the underpayment of duties was a charge within the jurisdiction of the secretary of the treasury under a.continuing,we stated that there could not be a decision on a charge for purposes of starting the running of a limitations period until the party levying the charge announced that the charge was being levied and stated the amount of the charge,or the method of computing the charge.id.at.we concluded 
t he liquidations in this case,which made no mention of interest,were not decisions regarding interest for purposes of starting the running of the limitations period against new zealand lamb.such a decision did not come until march,when customs billed new zealand lamb for the interest.
id.footnote omitted.see also castelazo,at stating that under section customs decisions on charges or exactions,such as assessed interest,are independent of its decisions on liquidation or reliquidation.
fujitsu deemed liquidation claim relating to protest was not timely under section c.neither did the claim constitute a new ground in support of the challenge to the assessment of interest in protest.for these reasons,the court of international trade did not err in refusing to assert jurisdiction over the claim under a.
whether,under i,the court of international trade had jurisdiction over the deemed liquidation claims relating to protests and 
alternatively,fujitsu contends that i vested the court of international trade with the authority to review its deemed liquidation claim relating to protest.it also contends that the statute gave the court authority to review its deemed liquidation claim relating to protest.we disagree.fujitsu argument runs afoul of the rule,noted above,that s ection i jurisdiction may not be invoked when jurisdiction under another subsection of is or could have been available,unless the remedy provided under that other subsection would be manifestly inadequate.foods,at quoting miller,at.
in this case,jurisdiction under another subsection of could have been available,and the remedy provided under that other subsection would not have been manifestly inadequate.fujitsu could have invoked the jurisdiction of the court of international trade under a if,pursuant to a,it had timely protested the liquidations of november and december,protest,and the liquidation of november,protest.indeed,fujitsu was able to invoke the jurisdiction of the court in the case of its challenge to the liquidation of february,protest,because it timely protested the liquidation.
generally,an importer failure to file a timely protest precludes the court of international trade from exercising its section i residual jurisdiction.see juice farms,at.fujitsu argues,nevertheless,that our decision in united states cherry hill textiles,supports its contention that the court of international trade erred in not invoking its i jurisdiction to consider fujitsu deemed liquidation claims.cherry hill does not help fujitsu,however.
in cherry hill,cherry hill textiles,cherry hill imported machines from taiwan.the machines were entered as duty free through the port of newark,new jersey,on september.on october,more than thirteen months after the date of entry,customs liquidated the entry as dutiable in the amount of.cherry hill,at.customs gave notice to cherry hill of the liquidation and subsequently demanded payment from cherry hill surety,international cargo surety insurance ic s under its bond.ic s refused to make payment.it did not,however,file a formal protest under of either the liquidation or the demand for payment.id.
after the period for filing a protest had passed,the government filed an enforcement action in the court of international trade in which it sought to recover the in assessed duties.in due course,the government moved for summary judgment.in so doing,it contended that ic s failure to file a protest against either the liquidation or the demand for payment under the bond rendered the october,liquidation final and conclusive within the meaning of a,so that judicial review of ic s affirmative defenses was precluded.ic s argued in response that the provision of section a that makes unprotested liquidations final and conclusive applies to actions brought by importers or sureties to recover excess duty deposits,but not to government enforcement actions for unpaid duties.the court of international trade rejected ic s argument and granted summary judgment for the government in the full amount of the assessed duties,plus interest.id.ic s then appealed to this court.
we framed the issue before us in cherry hill as follows 
it is undisputed that an administrative protest must be filed if an importer or surety wishes to file suit in the court of international trade challenging the liquidation of a customs entry.the principal issue in this case is whether an importer or surety must file such an administrative protest if the importer or surety wishes to defend against a government enforcement action for the underpayment of duties by challenging the lawfulness of a liquidation.
id.at.on appeal,ic s advanced two contentions.first,it argued that the protest requirement of section applies to actions brought by importers or sureties for the refund of duties paid,but that it does not apply to enforcement actions brought by the government to collect underpayments of duties.cherry hill,at.accordingly,ic s claimed that it was entitled to challenge the government enforcement action,even though it had not filed a timely protest of the liquidation with customs.we rejected this argument.in so doing,we stated the language of section,that a liquidation will be final and conclusive unless protested,is sufficiently broad that it indicates that congress meant to foreclose unprotested issues from being raised in any context,not simply to impose a prerequisite to bringing suit.id.at.
ic s also argued that summary judgment should not have been granted in favor of the government because the entry of september,was deemed liquidated by operation of law when customs failed to liquidate it within one year of the date of entry.see a.ic s urged that it should not have been required to protest the october,liquidation in order to be entitled to argue later that customs was legally foreclosed from liquidating the entry anew after the entry had already been deemed liquidated.cherry hill,at.we looked more favorably on this argument by ic s,which we characterized as a narrower ground for reversal.id.we pointed out that in united states sherman sons,the supreme court concluded that an importer who is subjected to a reliquidation based on a charge of fraud is not relegated to the protest and appeal mechanism,but may challenge the finding of fraud in a government enforcement action brought in court even if the importer filed no protest of the reliquidation.cherry hill,at citing sherman,at.we reasoned in cherry hill that deemed liquidation under section has the same effect as the expiration of the time for reliquidation in sherman it subjects any further collection efforts by the government in connection with the same entry to dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.id.at accordingly,we held that ic s could raise deemed liquidation as a defense in the government enforcement action.
the critical difference between cherry hill and this case,of course,is that fujitsu is not seeking to use its deemed liquidation claim as a shield in a government enforcement action.rather,it is seeking to use the claim as a sword in a refund action under i.as noted above,the cherry hill court recognized that i t is undisputed that an administrative protest must be filed if an importer or surety wishes to file suit in the court of international trade challenging the liquidation of a customs entry.at.in addition,as discussed above,jurisdiction may not be invoked under i when jurisdiction under another subsection of is or could have been available,unless the remedy provided under that other subsection would be manifestly inadequate.foods,at quoting miller,at.that plainly is not the case here since,as already noted,fujitsu could have timely protested customs purported liquidations under a.in that event,the court of international trade would have had jurisdiction over fujitsu suit under a.we agree with the court of international trade that t o find that cherry hill affords fujitsu jurisdiction under i to raise its deemed liquidation argument in the circumstances of this case would require us to create an exception to the rule with respect to i jurisdiction that we are unwilling to make.fujitsu,d at.accordingly,we will not disturb the court of international trade ruling that it lacked jurisdiction under section i to consider fujitsu protest and protest deemed liquidation claims.
we turn now to fujitsu deemed liquidation claim relating to the entries that customs liquidated on february,protest.the court of international trade exercised jurisdiction over this claim because fujitsu timely asserted it in connection with protest on april.on the merits,the court rejected fujitsu argument that the failure of customs to liquidate the entries within six months of our july,decision in fujitsu general meant that,pursuant to d,the entries were deemed liquidated at the rate of duty asserted at entry.
decision of the court of international trade on fujitsu deemed liquidation claim relating to protest.
section d governs the deemed liquidation of entries whose liquidation previously was suspended by a court order.the statute provides that,except in circumstances not relevant here,
when a suspension of liquidation required by court order is removed,the customs service shall liquidate the entry within months after receiving notice of the removal from the department of commerce,other agency,or a court with jurisdiction over the entry.any entry not liquidated by the customs service within months after receiving such notice shall be treated as having been liquidated at the rate of duty,value,quantity,and amount of duty asserted at the time of entry by the importer of record.
d.thus,in order for a deemed liquidation to occur,the suspension of liquidation that was in place must have been removed customs must have received notice of the removal of the suspension and customs must not liquidate the entry at issue within six months of receiving such notice.the court of international trade rejected fujitsu deemed liquidation claim because it ruled that customs had liquidated the entries at issue within six months of september,the date on which commerce published notice in the federal register that the injunction suspending liquidation had been removed.d at.
in analyzing fujitsu claim,the court of international trade first addressed the question of when the suspension of liquidation that was imposed during the fujitsu general litigation was removed for purposes of section d.the court pointed out that e explains how liquidation will proceed where entries are subject to a determination that is being judicially reviewed pursuant to.id.at.section e provides as follows 
e liquidation in accordance with final decision 
if the cause of action is sustained in whole or in part by a decision of the united states court of international trade or of the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
entries of merchandise of the character covered by the published determination of the secretary,the administering authority,or the commission,which is sic entered,or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption after the date of publication in the federal register by the secretary or the administering authority of a notice of the court decision,and 
entries,the liquidation of which was enjoined under subsection c of this section,
shall be liquidated in accordance with the final court decision in the action.such notice of the court decision shall be published within ten days from the date of the issuance of the court decision.
liquidation of the protest entries was enjoined pursuant to c.the court of international trade determined that,as used in section e,the term final means conclusive and that a court decision is conclusive when it can no longer be appealed.fujitsu,d at.the court reasoned that our decision of july,in fujitsu general could not have served as notice to customs of the removal of the suspension because,under section e,the injunction did not dissolve on that date.rather,the injunction dissolved on october,when the time allowed for applying for a writ of certiorari for review in the supreme court expired.id.in reaching its conclusion as to when our decision in fujitsu general became final,the court of international trade relied on decisions of this court holding that a decision of the court of international trade is not final for purposes of section e when it has been appealed to the federal circuit.see hosiden advanced display mfrs.of america,timken united states.
having determined that our decision in fujitsu general,which caused the suspension of liquidation to be removed,became final on october,the court of international trade turned to the question of when customs received notice that the suspension had been removed.preliminarily,the court rejected the proposition that issuance of the fujitsu general decision itself constituted notice for purposes of section d.noting that customs role in antidumping matters is purely ministerial,see mitsubishi elects,united states,the court stated that it would not attribute notice to customs of a court decision reviewing a commerce determination made under a without publication of notice of the court decision by commerce in the federal register.fujitsu,d at footnote omitted.accordingly,the court held that customs received notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation relating to the entries at issue in protest only when commerce published the following notice in the federal register on september,
as there is now a final and conclusive court decision in this action,we are amending our final results of review in this matter and we will subsequently instruct the customs service to liquidate entries subject to this review pursuant to e,we are now amending the final results of administrative review for television receivers,monochrome and color,from japan,with respect to fujitsu general limited,for the periods.the revised margin for these periods is percent.
the court also rejected the government argument that customs did not receive notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation until commerce liquidation instructions to customs on september.see fujitsu,d at.
the court of international trade ruled that since customs had liquidated the protest entries on february,within six months of the september,federal register notice,the requirements for deemed liquidation under d were not met.id.at.
the court of international trade recognized the long delay between october,when the injunction dissolved,and september,when commerce finally published the required notice in the federal register.id.at.it declined,however,to hold that fujitsu merchandise was deemed liquidated because of commerce delay in publishing notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation.the court reasoned that such a remedy would be overly broad and would constitute a windfall to fujitsu,especially since fujitsu could have brought an action under i to compel commerce to publish notice and give liquidation instructions to customs.see id.citing am.permac,united states.int l trade importer may prevent commerce delay in issuing liquidation instructions by bringing mandamus action see also timken,at affirming grant of importer application for a writ of mandamus forcing commerce to publish notice of court decision.the court therefore granted the government motion for summary judgment.
fujitsu appeal 
fujitsu challenges the court of international trade rejection of its deemed liquidation claim relating to protest.pointing to the statutory language that permits customs to receive notice of the removal of a suspension of liquidation from the department of commerce,other agency,or a court with jurisdiction over the entry,d,fujitsu asserts that through the decision in fujitsu general,customs was provided with notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation.fujitsu argues that since fujitsu general issued on july,and since customs did not liquidate the protest entries until more than six months later,on february,the requirements of d for deemed liquidation were met.consequently,the protest entries were deemed liquidated at the rate of duty asserted at the time of entry,which was zero.
the question we must answer is this when,as a matter of law,did customs receive notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation if,as fujitsu argues,notice was received on july,when fujitsu general issued,fujitsu wins.the reason is that more than six months passed before customs liquidated the entries on february.if,as the court of international trade held,notice was received on september,when commerce published notice of the removal in the federal register,the government wins.the reason is that customs liquidated the entries within six months of that date,on february.
preliminarily,we agree with the court of international trade that the suspension of liquidation was removed on october,when the time for petitioning the supreme court for a writ of certiorari expired.in timken,we addressed the question of whether a decision of the court of international trade that was on appeal to the federal circuit was final for purposes of e.answering the question we stated we are of the opinion that an appealed cit decision is not a final court decision within the plain meaning of e.id.at.we explained that,in section e,the term final court decision must be read together with the words that follow it in the action.we reasoned that a n action does not end when one court renders a decision but continues through the appeal process.id.we see no reason not to extend the logic of timken to the question before us in this case we do not think that,for present purposes,the appeal process in a case is completed until all possible appeals are exhausted.thus,there is not a final court decision in an action that originates in the court of international trade and in which there is an appeal to the federal circuit until,following the decision of the federal circuit,the time for petitioning the supreme court for certiorari expires without the filing of a petition.
having determined that the suspension of liquidation was removed on october,we turn to the question of notice.as already seen,section d requires that customs receive notice that a suspension of liquidation has been removed from the department of commerce,other agency,or a court with jurisdiction over the entry.there is no evidence in the record that customs received such notice prior to september.it is true,as fujitsu points out,that on or about july,the clerk of the federal circuit served counsel for the government,the department of justice,with the decision in fujitsu general.that fact does not help fujitsu,however.the justice department represented commerce,not customs,before this court.service of the fujitsu general decision upon it did not constitute notice to customs.
fujitsu argues,nevertheless,that our decision in fujitsu general was available in a variety of commercially available print and electronic media,thus providing customs with notice for purposes of d.the problem with this argument is that the statute requires that customs receive notice that a suspension of liquidation has been removed from the department of commerce,other agency,or a court with jurisdiction over the entry.general print or electronic media publication does not satisfy that requirement.in any event,there is no evidence that in fact customs received general media notice of the fujitsu general decision.
because no earlier date qualifies,we hold that september,is the earliest date upon which customs could be deemed to have received notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation.that is the date upon which commerce published notice of the fujitsu general decision in the federal register.
the government argues,however,that the correct notice date is september,when commerce liquidation instructions to customs.as noted above,the court of international trade rejected that view and ruled that september,was the date upon which notice was received.we agree with the court of international trade that it was commerce publication of notice of the fujitsu general decision in the federal register on september,that constituted notice to customs under section d that the suspension of liquidation had been removed.
our recent decision in international trading united states,is instructive.in that case,the liquidation of certain entries of merchandise subject to an antidumping order was suspended while commerce undertook an administrative review of the order.the suspension of liquidation was pursuant to d on february,commerce published the final results of the administrative review in the federal register.the final results announced an antidumping duty rate of for the merchandise.id.at.the next day,commerce sent an message to customs.in the message,customs referred to the federal register entry of the previous day and noted that the administrative review had been completed.however,it told customs not to liquidate any entries covered by the review until it received liquidation instructions.id.at.more than six months later,on august,commerce sent an message to customs directing it to assess antidumping duties at the rate of on the merchandise.the message stated that the instructions constituted the removal of the suspension of liquidation that had been in effect during the administrative review.less than six months later,in october of,customs liquidated the entries and assessed antidumping duties at the rate of of the entered value.id.at.
international trading company itc,the importer of the merchandise,filed a formal protest.in the protest,it argued that the entries were deemed liquidated by operation of law under d at the rate asserted at entry,which was the deposit rate of.itc contended that the entries were deemed liquidated because customs had failed to liquidate them within six months after receiving notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation.id.at.after customs denied the protest,itc filed an action in the court of international trade,in which it asserted that the entries should have been deemed liquidated at the deposit rate.
the court of international trade held that the statutory suspension of liquidation had been removed upon the publication of the final results of the administrative review and that the message sent to customs the following day provided notice to customs that the suspension of liquidation had been lifted.int trading united states,d.int l trade.accordingly,the court concluded that customs had failed to liquidate the entries within six months after receiving notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation.the court therefore held that the entries were deemed liquidated at the deposit rate.id.the government appealed the ruling to this court.
on appeal,we affirmed the decision of the court of international trade that the entries at issue were deemed liquidated under d.in so doing,we determined that commerce publication of the final results of the administrative review in the federal register constituted notice to customs within the meaning of section d.int trading,at.we stated 
t he date of publication provides an unambiguous and public starting point for the liquidation period,and it does not give the government the ability to postpone indefinitely the removal of suspension of liquidation and thus the date by which liquidation must be completed as would be the case if the liquidation period did not begin to run until commerce sent a message to customs advising of the removal of suspension of liquidation.beyond that,treating the date of notification as separate from the date of publication could lead to messy factual disputes about when customs actually received notice of the removal of the suspension of liquidation.as in this case,the courts would be required to referee debates about what kind of communication from commerce relating to the announcement of the final results constituted a qualifying notice of the removal of suspension.
we think the rationale articulated in international trading applies in this case.the court of international trade enjoined liquidation in fujitsu gener
