background 
mittal manufactures and sells steel wire rod in trinidad tobago.together with its north american affiliate and importer,mittal also sells steel wire rod for export to the united states.under,commerce imposes an antidumping duty if it determines that a category of foreign merchandise is being sold in the united states at less than fair market value and the importation causes or threatens material injury to a market commerce calculates that duty by comparing the normal value to the constructed export price.see id.commerce determines the normal value by including foreign sales of prime merchandise but excluding foreign sales of merchandise.in determining the constructed export price,commerce deducts credit expenses over a length of time,known as the credit expense period.
mittal manufactures two types of steel wire rod that are relevant to this appeal prime rod and composite rod.prime rod and composite rod are composed of steel of the same grade and chemical structure commerce classifies steel wire rod based on eight characteristics grade range,carbon content range,surface quality,deoxidization,maximum total residual content,heat treatment,diameter range,and coating.commerce then assigns an control number based on those characteristics.mittal composite and prime rod have the same control number and are thus the same in each of the eight characteristics.a coil of each contains approximately the same weight of steel.
however,prime and composite rod are listed separately on mittal price lists.the difference is that,while a coil of prime rod consists of a single piece of steel,a coil of composite rod contains multiple separate segments.because of resulting processing inefficiencies,mittal also sells composite rod at a lower price than prime rod.commerce thus found that composite rod was merchandise and excluded it from commerce normal value calculation because composite rod was not identified as prime on mittal price list for matching purposes and because,in mittal prime rod,commerce found identical or similar matches to the rod sold in the united states.carbon and certain alloy steel wire rod from trinidad tobago.accompanying issues and decisions,cmt,available at.doc.gov frn summary trinidad e.pdf dep t of commerce.
the court of international trade affirmed commerce determination because the composite rod was not identical to the prime rod.mittal steel,d at.the court reasoned that mittal sold the rods at different prices,demonstrating that the rods had commercially significant differences.id.
commerce also computed mittal credit expense period to determine the duty mittal owed.credit expenses are the costs associated with money being owed to the seller after the seller has sold its merchandise but before the customer has paid the seller.id.at.mittal follows a unique sales model in the united states.under mittal system,a customer first places an order with mittal north american affiliate.mittal then ships the rods from trinidad to the united states.after the rods arrive in the united states,the north american affiliate issues an invoice to the customer and ships the rods to him.at any point prior to the date of invoice,all terms of sale,including the quantity of merchandise to be sold,are changeable.
in previous cases and in its prior administrative review involving mittal,commerce had calculated credit expenses beginning on the date of shipment.thus,in this case,commerce initially began mittal credit expense period on the shipment date mittal shipped the merchandise from trinidad to the united states.
however,in the same administrative review,commerce had also determined a date of sale.commerce normally chooses the invoice date as the date of sale because,on the invoice date,the terms of sale have usually been fixed.commerce uses the shipment date as the date of sale,however,when the shipment date is earlier than the invoice date or when a affiliate warehouses the merchandise in the united states and sells from inventory.in those situations,the terms of sale have not been fixed until the date that the seller ships the merchandise.in the same administrative review here,commerce had used the invoice date,rather than the shipment date,as the date of sale for all of mittal constructed export price sales.
while the case was on appeal to the court of international trade,the court requested briefing on the date for beginning the credit expense calculation.gerdau supported commerce determination,arguing that the date of sale was irrelevant to the credit expense period determination.the government responded by requesting a voluntary remand,with the consent of mittal and gerdau,for commerce to reevaluate the credit expense period based on the date of sale.in other words,commerce wanted to consider making the beginning of the credit expense period,which had been the shipment date,match the chosen date of sale,which had been the invoice date.on april,the court granted the voluntary remand for commerce to determine the date on which credit expenses should begin to run.mittal steel,d at.the court reasoned that,given mittal sales model and commerce decision that the date of sale was mittal invoice date,commerce could reasonably find that mittal terms of sale were not set until the invoice date.id.at.
on remand,commerce issued a draft remand determination on may,and requested comment from the parties by may.in the draft remand determination,commerce recalculated the credit expense period to begin on the invoice date because the material terms of sale were not set before the invoice date.on june,after receiving no comments from gerdau,commerce filed the final remand determination in the court of international trade,incorporating the other parties comments and calculating credit expenses from the invoice date.the court then affirmed commerce final remand determination,noting that gerdau had filed no comments on the remand results.mittal steel,d at.
mittal timely appealed to this court,and gerdau has filed a timely.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

mittal argues that commerce incorrectly determined that mittal composite rods were merchandise.mittal asserts that its prime and composite rods are identical for calculation purposes because,on each of commerce eight criteria,mittal prime and composite rods are identical,and they have the same control number.moreo
