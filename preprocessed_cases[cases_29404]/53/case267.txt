the general electric company appeals the decision of the united states international trade commission,holding that certain variable speed wind turbines imported by mitsubishi heavy industries,and mitsubishi power systems americas,together mitsubishi do not violate section of the tariff act.the patents at issue were general electric united states patents the patent,the patent,and the patent.
the commission proceedings 
on general electric complaint,the commission conducted an investigation and the administrative law judge held an evidentiary hearing on all of the issues raised by general electric as complainant,by mitsubishi as respondent,and by the commission investigators.by final initial determination,including pages of findings of fact and conclusions of law,the alj held that section is violated by the imported mitsubishi turbines.the alj determined that the patent is not invalid by reason of obviousness that the patent is not invalid by reason of obviousness,written description,or enablement and that the patent is not invalid by reason of obviousness or best mode.the alj also determined that the three patents are infringed by the imported mitsubishi wind turbines,and that the intent element of inequitable conduct as to the patent was not established.the alj also determined that the domestic industry requirement is not met as to the patent,but is met as to the and patents.
each participant requested review by the full commission of the alj adverse rulings.the commission noticed review of the final initial determination except for the issue of importation and the intent finding of inequitable conduct the commission received briefing and argument on all of the other issues,and held by final determination that the patent is not invalid by reason of obviousness or written description,that the and patents are not infringed by the mitsubishi turbines,and that the domestic industry requirement is not met as to any of the patents.the commission took no position on any other issue in the final initial determination,and held that section is not violated by the mitsubishi imported turbines.this appeal followed.
the patent expired on february,and this court dismissed that portion of the appeal as moot,vacating the commission rulings as to the patent we now affirm the commission ruling that the patent is not infringed.we reverse the commission determination of no domestic industry as to the patent,and remand for further proceedings with respect to the patent.
variable speed wind turbines 
electric power is generated from energy sources such as coal,natural gas,nuclear fission,flowing water,and wind,whereby the energy causes the rotation of magnets or electromagnets in association with coils of wire,producing an electric current.see the parties joint tutorial of the technology presented to the alj,hr g tr.
the electric current generated by wind turbines is usually fed to a centralized power grid,where electricity from various facilities is combined,stored,and distributed.although wind is an advantageous source of energy,wind activity tends to be extremely irregular,whereas uniform electric current of fixed frequency is required to be fed to the power grid.this led to the development of variable speed wind turbines,which convert the irregular product of wind energy into the alternating current ac required by the power grid.the general electric and patents are directed to structure and circuitry that protect the turbine components from the effects of irregularities caused by emergency events such as lightning strikes,downed power lines,short circuits,and the like.
the products whose importation is charged with violation of section are variable speed wind turbines designated as mitsubishi models mwt and mwt.as products of the domestic industry,general electric designated its models sle,xle,and se.the mitsubishi and general electric turbines have the structure and circuit configuration called a induction generator,illustrated as follows 
br.from.in operation,the wind turns the blades and causes the shaft to rotate,thereby spinning the rotor and producing a magnetic field in the winding coils,generating electric current.to produce ac electricity of uniform and fixed frequency,in induction generators a second magnetic field is imposed by current drawn from the grid and,by operations not here at issue,the system produces electricity of the desired uniform frequency.testimony of collins,hr g tr.
the patent 
the patent relates to protective circuitry for variations in grid supply voltage in doubly fed induction generator wind turbines.the patent explains that 
the problem arises that large voltage differences between grid and stator coils occur on variations of the supply voltage amplitudes caused in the grid by,short circuits.these differences cause,in turn,a strong current rise in the stator coils directly coupled to the grid.these strong current rises in the stator coils are caused because the induction generator is usually fully excited at the variation of the grid frequency amplitude and mechanical energy is permanently supplied by the rotor.the strong current rise occurring in the stator coils on variations of the supply voltage leads to high induction voltages in the rotor windings,which can,in turn,cause damages on the converters used for feeding the rotor current.
patent,ll.the patent employs a protective circuit called a crowbar circuit,which decouples the current unit from the rotor windings when large current variations occur,thereby protecting the circuitry.both the imported mitsubishi and the domestic general electric wind turbines employ a system of protective decoupling of the rotor windings from the converter,but the turbines differ in the method by which operation is restored.in the general electric turbines recoupling of the circuitry occurs when the elevation in current has declined to a predetermined value as measured in the turbine,and in the mitsubishi turbines recoupling occurs after a period of time.
claim construction 
the issue of infringement of the patent was determined based on the commission construction of the claims with respect to the method of restoring operation after an decoupling.the claim construction question is the meaning of the term predetermined value in the patent claim emphases added 
a wind turbine,comprising 
a rotor with at least one rotor blade,the rotor being rotatably arranged with regard to a substantially horizontal rotor axis 
an induction generator whose rotor windings are coupled to the rotor and whose stator coils can be coupled to a voltage grid 
a unit for feeding currents into the rotor windings 
a control unit for controlling the frequency of the currents depending on the rotor rotation frequency,and 
an emergency unit which can be operated to electrically decouple the unit from the rotor windings in case of variations of the grid voltage amplitude,wherein the emergency unit comprises a release arrangement for releasing the rotor current after decoupling,when the currents generated in the rotor windings by variation of the grid voltage amplitude triggering the decoupling are declined to a predetermined value.
the commission held that the claim release arrangement requires the wind turbine to measure current or an adequate proxy for current to determine whether the current has declined to a level previously decided upon.final determination,at.the commission held that a period of time is not such a proxy for current.
general electric argues that the term predetermined value,construed in light of the specification,includes not only a value of current,but also a predetermined period of time,for the patent states that turbine operation can be resumed under consideration of a predetermined time constant.patent,col ll.general electric points out that the patent recognizes and recites time periods for fluctuations in current,and argues that the commission incorrectly construed the claims as excluding a predetermined time constant from predetermined value.general electric cites several supporting statements in the specification 
basically,resuming the feeding of rotor current can be accomplished under consideration of a predetermined time constant.in view of an increase in plant safety,it has been shown particularly expedient that when the rotor current is sensed as a two or signal or the rectified current is sensed as a signal and the current that was sensed drops to a value,the feeding of the rotor current is resumed.current transformers transformers can be used for sensing the currents.
when the amplitude of the rotor current has dropped sufficiently after to msec milliseconds,the feeding of the rotor current can be resumed on recurrence of the supply voltage within the framework of the method according to the invention.
as is explained above,in this case the rotor and the starter current diminish within to msec depending on the resistance.
id.at ll,ll,ll.general electric,citing honeywell international,itt industries,argues that because the specification refers to a predetermined time constant within the framework of the method according to the invention,the passage of a fixed period of time is included in the scope of the claims.the alj agreed with general electric position,and held that a time constant,in the form of a specific time range,may be considered when determining that predetermined value.initial determination,at.
the full commission did not agree with the alj.the commission found that the portion of the specification that mentions a predetermined time constant is in the context of an increase in plant safety,and that the specification teaches that measurement of current,not time,increases safety.the commission found that the specification presents the latter mode as an improvement on the former mode.final determination,at.the specification only description of the operation of the invention shows recoupling upon measurement of a predetermined value of current,not upon passage of a period of time.
we share the commission view that the patentee describes the invention as the resumption of current feed after the current is restored to the predetermined value,not after a fixed period of time.the specification describes and enables the deactivation of the crowbar circuit w hen the current drops afterwards to a predetermined value of current there is no description or exemplification of resumption of operation by recoupling the rotor currents after a period of time.the specification states 
as is shown in,element crow bar can be realized as a bridge.in this case,the dying out of the rectified rotor currents can be accomplished via a current transformer resistor in the bridge.when the intermediate circuit voltage in converter exceeds a predetermined value due to exceedingly high rotor currents,the crow bar formed as a bridge is fired.then,the same procedure as in the case of a of the grid is executed.should an exceedingly high current appear in the rotor due to a undervoltage of the grid,the turbine really acts like in the case of a of the grid.when the current drops afterwards to a predetermined value,the thyristors of the bridge become blocked and the of the rotor windings is ended.the of rotor currents is then resumed.consequently,the thyristors form the release arrangement of the embodiment of the present invention.
patent,ll emphases added.figure,to which this passage refers,shows the crowbar circuit formed as a bridge that and thereby decouples the rotor windings upon the occurrence of exceedingly high rotor current.figure,a detailed view of the circuit diagram in patent figure,shows the transformer resistor,the rotor converter,and stator coils 
the specification explains that the crowbar circuit is deactivated,the bridge is blocked,and the rotor windings are recoupled,when the current drops to the predetermined value.
no embodiment in the patent,no drawing,no circuitry,shows recoupling solely after a predetermined period of time.although the specification shows that general electric knew that various electrical disturbances for which this protective circuitry is intended occur within a known duration,the invention as claimed is explicitly limited to recoupling when the actual end of the specific disturbance has been determined by measurement of when the current has declined to a predetermined value.although general electric recognized and described the usual duration of such electrical disturbances,a possibly broader disclosure accompanied by an explicit narrow claim shows the inventor selection of the narrow claim scope.see the specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.
the commission held that the claims are directed to a predetermined value of current or a proxy for current.the inclusion of a proxy for current comports with linear technology international trade commission,which held that monitoring the current to the load could be indirectly measured by voltage,for once voltage is known,one skilled in the art would recognize that ohm easily allows current to be calculated,therefore monitoring current indirectly by monitoring voltage.the commission construction of predetermined value as a value of current or a proxy for current stays true to the claim language and most naturally aligns with the patent description of the invention.phillips awh,en banc quoting renishaw plc marposs societá per azioni.this claim construction is affirmed.
infringement 
for infringement,every element and limitation of a claim of the patent must be found in the accused device,literally or in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents.it is not disputed that the mitsubishi turbines do not measure current or voltage in determining when to resume the connection after decoupling has occurred.the record contains expert testimony on the question of whether a time period in the mitsubishi turbines is an adequate proxy for current.the experts for both sides agreed that there is no predictable relationship between the duration of events and the restoration of safe current levels,because of the variety of factors that can affect such events and their duration.testimony of toliyat,hr g tr.may,testimony of collins,hr g tr.may.the experts testimony supports the commission finding that a predetermined value of time can not serve as an adequate proxy for current because the relationship between the two can not be guaranteed.final determination,at.we affirm the commission finding that the mitsubishi turbine,whereby recoupling occurs after a period of time,does not literally infringe the claims.
general electric argued that even if there is not literal infringement,the doctrine of equivalents applies because the system in the patent and the mitsubishi system perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same result,whether recoupling is measured by current drop or by the passage of time.see voda cordis,summarizing the criteria of infringement based on equivalency.the commission found that a system that measures when the specific emergency event has actually ended is not substantially the same as a system that applies the same time period to all emergency events.this finding was supported by substantial evidence in the form of the experts testimony with respect to the technological facts.the commission determination that the mitsubishi turbines do not infringe the patent under the doctrine of equivalents is affirmed.
domestic industry 
in view of our affirmance of noninfringement of the patent,we affirm that section is not violated based on the patent.although the commission also ruled that general electric turbines do not now practice the invention and therefore do not meet the domestic industry requirement as to this patent,we do not reach that aspect,and vacate the commission ruling thereon.
the patent 
the patent is directed to wind turbine circuitry that provides a stable output of electricity to the grid during low voltage events.the commission construed the patent claim,the only claim at issue,in a manner that excluded the general electric turbines from the scope of the claim,and on this claim construction the commission held that there is no domestic industry as to the patent.the domestic industry requirement of the tariff act is set forth in a,subsections and 
a subparagraphs b,c,d,and e of paragraph concerning violations of section apply only if an industry in the united states,relating to the articles protected by the patent,copyright,trademark,mask work,or design concerned,exists or is in the process of being established.
a for purposes of paragraph,an industry in the united states shall be considered to exist if there is in the united states,with respect to the articles protected by the patent,copyright,trademark,mask work or design concerned 
a significant investment in plant and equipment 
b significant employment of labor or capital or 
c substantial investment in its exploitation,including engineering,research and development,or licensing.
the patent,entitled low voltage ride through for wind turbine generators,is directed to wind turbine structure and circuitry that provide ride through stabilization in periods of voltage fluctuation.the specification describes low voltage ride through as providing one or more of the following responses to voltage fluctuation 
to remain synchronized to the power grid during severe voltage fluctuations,to maintain functioning of the blade pitch system in spite of lack of voltage at the generator terminals,to protect the power converter and generator from high voltages and currents during the voltage fluctuation,and to temporarily shut down that could be damaged by exposure to low voltages or could be tripped by either circuit breaker action or fuse operation.
patent,ll.ride through in the patent is achieved by circuitry that monitors voltage and provides supplemental power from an uninterruptible power supply when the system signals the need for ride through,and thereby protects the power converter and generator during voltage fluctuations while preserving the turbine connection with the power grid.
the commission construed the patent claim with attention to the aspect that is disputed in application to the general electric turbines emphasis added to the aspect of concern 
a wind turbine generator comprising 
a generator 
a power converter coupled with the generator,the power converter having an inverter coupled to receive power from the generator,a converter controller coupled with the inverter to monitor a current flow in the inverter wherein the converter controller is coupled to receive power from an uninterruptible power supply during a low voltage event,and a circuit coupled with the input of the inverter and with the converter controller to shunt current from the inverter and generator rotor in response to a control signal from the converter controller.
patent figure is a block diagram of one embodiment of a power converter having functionality to respond to a low voltage event.id.at ll 
figure shows inverters as part of the power converter the inverters receive power as needed during a low voltage event to keep the wind turbine generator connected to and synchronized with the power grid.patent,ll.the specification describes the connections and functions of the components,including the following 
inverter is coupled with the generator not illustrated in and to inverter which is coupled with the power grid.crowbar circuit is coupled with the output of the generator rotor.converter controller is coupled to receive data indicating the current flowing in inverter and to control crowbar circuit.in one embodiment,converter controller selectively activates and deactivates crowbar circuit to maintain the current in inverter within an acceptable range.
crowbar circuits are known in the art and any appropriate,a circuit having sufficient power ratings crowbar circuit can be used.in general,crowbar circuit operates to shunt current from the generator rotor and inverter and maintain inverter currents within safe levels.thus,during normal operation crowbar circuit is inactive.during a low voltage event converter controller selectively activates crowbar circuit to maintain current levels in a safe range.thus,crowbar circuit and converter controller are part of a system that allows a wind turbine generator to ride through low voltage events and remain synchronized to the power grid.
the issue of claim construction was whether claim requires that the circuit that shunts current on signal from the converter controller is located entirely outside of the inverter.the commission held that the shunt circuit must be separate from the inverter,for otherwise the circuit could not shunt current from the inverter,as claim states.on this construction,the commission ruled that general electric shunt circuit does not shunt current from the inverter because it is within the inverter.final determination,at.the alj had reached a different conclusion,holding that whether a particular shunting circuit located within the inverter as opposed to outside it meets the claim limitation will depend upon whether it is found to be coupled with the input of the inverter and the converter controller,as required by the claim.initial determination,at.the alj held that the claim does not contain the additional requirement that the shunt circuit is located entirely outside of the inverter.
the specification,in describing how the circuit shunts current from the generator rotor and the inverter,and describing the connections of the components,does not require that the components are entirely separate.providing a protective circuit that maintains currents within an allowable range,ll,does not require that the inverter and shunt circuits are entirely separate.nor do the words of claim coupled with the input of the inverter and with the converter controller,connote physical separation of the shunt circuit from the inverter.
the commission apparently viewed the claim clause shunt current from the inverter and generator rotor in isolation from its context as a circuit coupled with the input of the inverter and with the converter controller.however,the function of the shunt circuit does not depend on whether the shunt circuit is entirely outside of the inverter,and the specification does not require separation of the inverter and the shunt circuit in order for that circuit to be coupled with the input of the inverter and with the converter controller rather,the term coupled with indicates a connection.see johnson worldwide,zebco,c oupled generically describes a connection,and does not require a mechanical or physical coupling.
a similar argument was rejected in ntp,research in motion,where some of the claims recited a receiver connected to or coupled to a processor or that the receiver transfers information to the processor.the accused infringer in ntp had argued that connected to,coupled to,and transfer from each requires the receiver and the processor to be separate,but the court concluded that the two components could be connected,joined,or linked together by wires or other electrical conductors and still be located in the same housing or even on the same circuit board.at.the court also held that the function that information is transferred between two entities does not require physical separation of the entities.id.at.ntp does not support the commission ruling that the word from requires physical separation of the shunt circuit and the inverter.
we conclude that claim requires that the circuit is coupled with the input of the inverter and the converter controller,whereby the current is shunted from the inverter and the rotor this requirement does not limit the placement of the shunting circuitry to a location entirely external to the inverter.as in linear technology,there is nothing in the claim language or specification that supports narrowly construing the terms to require a specific structural requirement or entirely distinct circuits.rather,the circuits must only perform their stated functions.at 
mitsubishi also argues that the general electric turbines embody a modification of the circuitry system in the patent,and that this modification is separately patented in general electric patent.mitsubishi states that if general electric turbines practice the subject matter claimed in a separate patent,they can not practice the
