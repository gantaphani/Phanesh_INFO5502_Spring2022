background 
the relevant facts are set forth in our previous opinion in this case,ford motor united states,ford i.they are as follows 
ford operates an assembly plant in louisville,kentucky,at which it manufactures both cars and trucks using imported foreign engines and transmissions.see ford i,at.in,ford applied to establish a foreign trade subzone ftsz at the plant,pursuant to ford application was approved,and an ftsz was established at the louisville plant.the louisville ftsz operated between november of and february of.ford i,at.
an ftsz is an area inside the united states that may receive treatment under the customs laws as a territory outside the united states.see generally,c.at an ftsz,an importer has the choice of paying duties either at the rate applicable to the foreign material in its condition as admitted into a zone,or if used in manufacturing or processing,to the emerging product.ford i,at see also armco steel stans,cir.
during the relevant time period,the duty rate published in the tariff schedules of the united states for cars imported into the united states was ad valorem,while the duty rate for imported trucks was ad valorem.the duty rate for engines and transmissions for both cars and trucks was.under these circumstances,the optimal exploitative strategy for ford was to import engines and transmissions into the louisville ftsz,and then segregate those utilized to assemble cars from those utilized to assemble trucks.ford planned to treat the segregated car parts as foreign merchandise viewing the plant as being on foreign soil.it then would pay the duty on the emerging imported car.at the same time,ford planned to treat the segregated truck parts as domestic merchandise viewing the plant as being on united states soil.it then would pay the duty rate on the imported engines and transmissions,thereby avoiding the duty rate for completed trucks.
regulations that were in effect required that ford conduct its ftsz operations in a certain manner.first,it had to identify each part entering the louisville ftsz as either a car part or a truck part.ford then had to designate all car parts as foreign merchandise and all truck parts as privileged domestic merchandise on a customs form form.see a.to designate merchandise as either foreign or privileged domestic,the importer checks a box on the form that is labeled with the corresponding designation.see.
duties on foreign merchandise are not due and payable until the merchandise leaves the ftsz.see e see also.thus,ford could defer payment of duties on car transmissions and engines until it had installed them in completed cars.in that way,ford could capture the duty rate for cars rather than car parts.duties for foreign domestic merchandise,however,are due and payable upon entry of the merchandise into the ftsz.see a see also.thus,the regulations required that ford pay the duty on engines and transmissions to be installed in trucks as they entered the ftsz.in short,in order to operate the louisville ftsz in accordance with the applicable regulations,ford had to determine and designate the future usage of each part.then,based on that usage,ford had to identify the correct ftsz status for the part and make duty payments at the proper time.
during the three months it operated the ftsz at its louisville plant,ford received eleven entries of merchandise from abroad.the merchandise consisted of transmissions and engines that ford used in the manufacturing of vehicles.apparently through error,however,ford made incorrect entries with respect to the merchandise on the required forms.specifically,ford agent at the louisville ftsz designated each transmission and engine in the eleven entries it received at the ftsz between december of and february of,including those labeled as truck parts,as foreign.consequently,to the extent it intended to treat any of the entries as privileged domestic,ford failed to pay duties associated with these parts,as required by the governing regulations.see ford i,at.ford forms also were replete with errors regarding product descriptions,duty rates,and tariff item numbers.ford ii,d at.
ford reported its form error to customs.as a result of ford failure to designate the engines and transmissions destined for trucks as privileged domestic,and therefore pay the applicable ad valorem duty rate upon entry of the parts into the ftsz,customs asserted that the parts exited the ftsz and thus entered the united states as parts of completed trucks and were thus subject to a ad valorem duty.ford i,at.
in due course,customs agent richard mcnally began an investigation to determine the proper amount of duty that was due.in july of,mcnally prepared an initial internal report in which he concluded that the designations in ford forms had been improper,that the proper duty rate on the truck parts was,and that ford owed approximately million in additional duties.id.at.further,citing the significant amount of duty involved,mcnally referred the case to customs office of for a possible fraud investigation.ford ii,d at.in august of,pursuant to customs initiated a civil fraud investigation,which continued until at least march of.
pursuant to a,an entry of merchandise that is not liquidated within one year of the date of entry is deemed liquidated at the rate of duty asserted upon entry by the importer,unless the period for liquidation is extended under b.on the basis of the ongoing fraud investigation,customs issued three extensions of the statutory liquidation deadline.the extensions were issued on or about october,october of,and october.ford ii,d at.eventually,on december,customs liquidated the eleven entries with a duty on all parts asserted to be truck parts in the entries.the total additional duty amounted to approximately million.ford i,at.it appears from the record that customs completed its fraud investigation around march of.id.
ford timely protested the liquidations,contending,inter alia,that the eleven entries of engines and transmissions were deemed liquidated by operation of law at the rate asserted on importation,which as far as the parts asserted to be truck parts were concerned was.ford argued that customs had not shown that information needed for the proper appraisement or classification of the merchandise was not available to the appropriate customs officer to justify the three extensions under b.after customs denied the protest,ford paid the assessed duties and initiated an action in the court of international trade to challenge the liquidations pursuant to a.ford i,at.on for summary judgment,the court rejected ford claim,holding that,as a matter of law,the ongoing fraud investigation justified customs issuance of the three extensions before liquidating the entries.ford motor united states.int l trade.
ford appealed the court of international trade grant of summary judgment to this court,which analyzed whether ford had presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the propriety of customs successive extensions that delayed liquidation.in so doing,we interpreted b as requiring both that the investigation allegedly justifying the extension be reasonably expected to produce information regarding appraisement or classification and that customs seek that information in a reasonable amount of time.ford i,at.applying that standard and construing the evidence in a light most favorable to ford,we held that the record does not show that the fraud investigation was reasonably expected to produce information about appraisement and classification and that even if customs expected the investigation to turn up information relevant to appraisement and classification,that expectation alone can not justify summary judgment,since the length of the fraud investigation is subject to scrutiny for reasonableness.id.at.accordingly,we vacated the judgment of the court of international trade and remanded for a consideration of the propriety of customs extensions and delayed liquidation.
pursuant to our remand instructions,the court of international trade conducted a trial,during which it heard testimony from numerous witnesses with knowledge of customs fraud investigation and the decisions to extend the liquidation deadline under b.the court held that ford had failed to establish either that customs did not reasonably expect the investigation to uncover information regarding classification and appraisal or that customs did not act reasonably in pursuing that information over a period of three and a half years.ford ii,d at.accordingly,the court determined that customs extensions and delayed liquidation complied with it therefore entered judgment in favor of the united states.id.at ford timely appealed the court final decision.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
as in effect during the relevant period,section provided in pertinent part as follows 
a liquidation.except as provided in subsection b of this section,an entry of merchandise not liquidated within one year shall be deemed liquidated at the rate of duty,value,quantity,and amount of duties asserted at the time of entry by the importer 
b extension.the secretary may extend the period in which to liquidate an entry if 
information needed for the proper appraisement or classification of the merchandise is not available to the appropriate customs officer 
a,b.in paul fire marine insurance,united states,we acknowledged that customs possesses broad discretion concerning whether a liquidation extension is warranted under b.see also providing that the secretary of the treasury shall direct the superintendence of the collection of the duties on imports as he shall judge best.as a result of that discretion,and the presumption of regularity that presume s that the import specialist properly performed his duties,paul,at,ford bore a heavy burden in attempting to demonstrate that customs abused its discretionary authority by issuing the liquidation extensions that are at issue.
we review the court of international trade conclusions of law de novo.bestfoods united states.following a trial,we review the court findings of fact for clear error.see better home plastics united states,casio,united states.the clear error standard requires us to accept the court of international trade findings of fact unless we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states united states gypsum.inwood,ives laboratories,d.whether customs abused its discretion either in extending the liquidation deadline under b or in pursuing its fraud investigation under is a question of fact.see paul,at.
on appeal,ford challenges the rulings of the court of international trade regarding both issues remanded by this court in ford specifically,ford argues that customs abused its discretion by issuing three successive extensions of the statutory liquidation deadline under b.according to ford,the fact that customs was conducting a fraud investigation under did not justify the extensions,since customs failed to identify a single piece of information needed for the proper appraisement or classification of the merchandise.b.further,ford contends,irrespective of whether customs reasonably expected to uncover such information,the court of international trade erred in deeming customs efforts in pursuing the fraud investigation reasonable.ford interprets the trial testimony as revealing an investigation characterized by unjustifiable delays and prolonged periods of inactivity.for that reason,ford argues that the manner in which the investigation was conducted fell well short of this court requirement that customs take a reasonable amount of time to seek the information related to classification and appraisement.ford i,at.for its part,the government argues that customs enjoys wide discretion and a presumption that it acted reasonably in conducting the investigation.see paul,at.further,the government contends that the delay in the investigation was justified by its complexity,the heavy caseloads of the agents conducting the investigation,and the diversion of the agents resources necessitated by the opening of a new customs office in bowling green,ohio.
our review in this case has been greatly aided by the court of international trade careful and thorough findings of fact with respect to what occurred between august of,when customs commenced the fraud investigation,and december of,when it liquidated the eleven entries of motor vehicle transmissions and engines that are at issue.not surprisingly,neither ford nor the government challenges those findings of fact.what the parties do dispute are the court of international trade two ultimate findings of fact that customs did not abuse its discretion in extending the deadline for liquidation on account of its reasonable belief that it would adduce information relating to classification or appraisal in the fraud investigation and that customs took a reasonable amount of time to pursue that information in its investigation.ford argues that the court erred with respect to both ultimate findings.we agree with ford on the second point,for we conclude that irrespective of whether customs reasonably expected the fraud investigation to produce information relating to classification or appraisal,customs delay in pursuing the fraud investigation and its resulting delay in liquidating the entries were not reasonable.in other words,while we accept all of the court of international trade operative findings of fact,we respectfully part company with the court on the ultimate conclusion to be drawn from those facts 
the eleven entries at issue entered the ftsz at various times between december of and february of.the last entry occurred on february,so that the regular period for liquidating all eleven entries at issue would absent any extensions have expired,pursuant to,one year after that date.as noted above,customs began its fraud investigation in august of after receiving agent mcnally referral the previous month.mcnally issued the first extension of liquidation in october of.
after reviewing the evidence adduced at trial,the court of international trade concluded that ford had not demonstrated that the amount of time consumed by the section investigation was unreasonable.ford ii,d at.the court first considered the progress of the fraud investigation under the auspices of special agent george fritz,from its inception in august of until november of,when the matter was reassigned to special agent charles kyle,a period of approximately months.during that time,fritz conducted a series of interviews related to the last of which occurred on march.id.the court of international trade acknowledged that in the eight months between that interview and the transfer of the investigation to agent kyle,it does not appear fritz conducted additional activities on the case.id.however,the court declined to equate such inactivity with an abuse of customs discretion in conducting the investigation,in light of fritz other commitments and time constraints,including other investigations and absences for sick leave,that limited his ability to work on the case.id.the second extension of liquidation was issued in october of,during this period of inactivity.id.at.
after concluding that customs conducted the section investigation reasonably under agent fritz,the court of international tr
