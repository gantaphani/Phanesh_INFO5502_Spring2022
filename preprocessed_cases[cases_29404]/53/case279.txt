revocation in part under d 
as relevant to the present case,d provides that i n general commerce may revoke,in whole or in part,an antidumping duty order after review under a periodic administrative review or ccr.pursuant to commerce regulations 
in determining whether to revoke an antidumping duty order in part,the secretary will consider 
b whether,for any exporter or producer that the secretary previously has determined to have sold the subject merchandise at less than normal value,the exporter or producer agrees in writing to immediate reinstatement in the order,as long as any exporter or producer is subject to the order,if the secretary concludes that the exporter or producer,subsequent to the revocation,sold the subject merchandise at less than normal value.
b i b emphasis added.thus,commerce interprets the revocation in part language in d to permit conditional revocation,revocation subject to reinstatement,if commerce finds that a party subject to an antidumping duty order resumes dumping.
ssi argues that commerce impermissibly interpreted d to permit conditional revocation.according to ssi,once commerce revokes an antidumping duty order with respect to a particular producer or exporter,t he order ceases to exist with respect to the merchandise for which it has been revoked,and accordingly can not later be reinstated without a new,formal injury determination under.appellant br.to support its finality argument,ssi relies on the revocation statute,providing that a determination to revoke an order shall apply with respect to all unliquidated entries of the subject merchandise,d emphasis added and commerce implementing regulations,defining the word revocation as the end of an antidumping proceeding,a emphasis added,not distinguishing between revocations in whole or in part in the definition.ssi asserts that the statute is clear on its face that a revocation is final,whether in whole or in part,and thus this court should not give chevron deference to commerce interpretation.in the alternative,ssi asserts that even if the court finds ambiguity in d and applies chevron deference,the court should not uphold commerce interpretation permitting conditional revocation in part of an antidumping duty order because commerce went far beyond any reasonable meaning that the statute might bear and created statutory authority where none exists.appellant br.finally,ssi argues that its certification of immediate reinstatement in the order in the event of resumed dumping is not a concession of the reasonableness of the practice because congress has not conferred such power to commerce,and ssi,a private party,can not confer the legal authority for an agency action that is otherwise illegal.appellant br.
steel and the government appellees counter that commerce properly interpreted its revocation authority to allow for conditional revocation in part.according to steel,because the language of d authorizes commerce to revoke antidumping duty orders,but does not state when commerce must exercise such authority,the agency is charged with supplying its own reasonable policies,standards and procedures.appellee br.u.steel.similarly,the government argues in its brief that because d does not define in part,commerce reasonably filled this statutory gap by implementing procedures for conditional revocation in part.appellee br.gov t.the government also asserts that ssi conceded the reasonableness of commerce interpretation of d by agreeing in its certification to immediate reinstatement in the order in the event that ssi resumed dumping.in its brief,however,steel states that it is not ssi certification,but the authority conferred by the statute,that is the basis of commerce authority to reinstate ssi in the order.the appellees argue that a new injury determination was not required to reinstate ssi in the order because the revocation in part was based solely on the cessation of dumping and did nothing to disturb the itc original injury determination,which included ssi subject merchandise.
as a policy matter,both the appellees and the cit opinion below caution that absent commerce ability to immediately reinstate a party revoked in part from an antidumping duty order,that party could simply refrain from dumping for three consecutive years,obtain revocation in part,and immediately thereafter resume dumping effectively averting the antidumping duty order until commerce and the itc make new,formal dumping and injury determinations.
this court concludes that d is ambiguous and that commerce reasonably interpreted d to permit the conditional revocation of an exporter or producer.section d gives commerce the authority to revoke antidumping duty orders in whole or in part.this language provides minimal guidance other than providing that the revocation should be carried out after review under subsection a a periodic administrative review or b a ccr d.the language of the statute is silent as to the conditions that might warrant the revocation of an antidumping duty order or the particular circumstances that would trigger such action.thus,commerce was left by congress to promulgate guidelines as to when revocations in whole or in part are appropriate and to set forth the proper procedures therefore.see chevron,at the power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left,implicitly or explicitly,by congress.
commerce interpreted its statutory authority under d in promulgating its revocation regulations at.just as the governing statute distinguishes between revocations in whole or in part,d emphasis added,so too does commerce in its regulations section b governs revocation in whole,and section b governs revocation in part.with regard to revocation in part,section b i b provides that the secretary should consider whether the exporter or producer being considered for revocation agree d in writing to its immediate reinstatement in the order if the secretary concludes that the exporter or producer,subsequent to revocation,resumed dumping.while ssi certification agreeing to immediate reinstatement in the order can not give commerce any authority it does not possess,ssi complaints about commerce action ring hollow given ssi express acknowledgement that it would be subject to immediate reinstatement if dumping resumed.
in addition,commerce interpretation of its revocation authority furthers the policy consideration of preventing a party subject to an antidumping duty order from refraining from dumping for three consecutive years,obtaining revocation in part,and then subsequently resuming dumping effectively evading the antidumping duty order.see ssi ii,d at.
ssi argues that this evasion concern is false because t he statute provides an explicit and exclusive remedy in through findings of dumping and injury.appellant reply br.ssi argument is incorrect for two reasons.first,a new itc injury determination under would be an unnecessary administrative burden on the itc contrary to the intent of the antidumping statute.see am.lamb united states,expressing the policy consideration in the context of a preliminary injury determination of eliminat ing unnecessary and costly investigations which are an administrative burden and an impediment to trade matsushita indus.united states,rejecting the idea that the commission must conduct a review investigation in the same neutral manner as an original investigation and not agree ing that a review investigation begins on a clean slate just as though it were an original investigation to determine whether an antidumping order should be put into effect avesta ab united states.int l trade a request for review of an affirmative injury determination through a ccr and the resultant review investigation are premised upon an underlying finding of injury from dumping which is entitled to deference and should not be disturbed lightly.second,as the appellees correctly argue,no new injury determination is required because the original itc injury determination includes ssi subject merchandise and is not disturbed by the revocation in part 
the itc injury determination does not examine the injury caused by discrete companies,but rather the injury caused by all dumped exports even if one or more exporters in that country may have been revoked from the order on the basis of absence of dumping,all dumped exports of subject merchandise from that country continue to cause or threaten material injury,pursuant to the itc affirmative injury determination.
initiation of ccr.at.
as commerce explained,the original injury determination for the imposition of the order remained valid and in effect for all subject merchandise,including ssi.three months after its revocation in part from the order,ssi participated in commerce sunset review of the order,filing a brief in support of full revocation of the order as to all subject merchandise.see usitc pub.at.ssi involvement in the sunset review demonstrated that ssi remained within the ambit of the order,particularly because ssi subject merchandise was still included in the injury determination giving rise to the order.
this court agrees with the appellees that commerce revocation in part was based on ssi cessation of dumping and did not disturb the itc injury determination.if this court were to accept ssi assertion that the original injury determination was somehow invalid as to ssi because of the revocation in part,such a holding would require the itc to make an injury determination for ssi subject merchandise separately from th
