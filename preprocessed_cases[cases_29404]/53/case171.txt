magnesium llc appeals from a judgment of the united states court of international trade the trade court in this antidumping duty case.the trade court sustained the department of commerce final determination in an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on pure magnesium from the people republic of china for the period of review may,to april.we affirm.
the united states imposes duties on foreign goods sold in the at less than fair value.to determine whether goods are being sold for less than fair value,commerce compares the export price,the price of the goods sold in the,to the normal value of the goods,which is ordinarily the price at which such goods are sold in the exporting country.id.when merchandise is exported from a nonmarket economy country,the normal value is constructed from the value of the factors of production utilized in producing the merchandise and to which shall be added an amount for general expenses and profit plus the cost of containers,coverings,and other expenses.id.c b.costs are generally calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise,if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country or the producing country,where appropriate and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise.id.f a.
this case concerns the importation of magnesium metal from the people republic of china.the imported magnesium is produced using a manufacturing process known as the pidgeon process.that process begins by crushing dolomite,a mineral containing magnesium,into granules.the dolomite granules are then calcinated by roasting them to remove carbon.the calcinated dolomite is then mixed with ferrosilicon and fluorite,and the mixture is pressed into individual briquettes.the briquettes are then loaded into stainless steel reaction vessels known as retorts.the retorts are placed under vacuum and heated,resulting in the separation and vaporization of the magnesium.the magnesium vapor condenses into crowns of solid magnesium metal.the crowns of magnesium metal are then removed from the retorts,melted down,purified,and cast into ingots for sale.
the retorts used in the pidgeon process must be replaced over time in a commercial operation,as the intense heat and the chemical reactions gradually degrade the interior of the retorts.after approximately days of use in multiple cycles of the manufacturing process,the retorts become unsuitable for the production of magnesium.the retorts are then recycled,and the recycled steel is used to produce new retorts this appeal focuses on how to classify the costs of the retorts in constructing the normal value of the exported product.
in,the commerce department entered an antidumping order on magnesium metal from the people republic of china.pure magnesium from the people republic of china,fed.reg.dep t of commerce may.on may,commerce provided notice of an opportunity for the parties to seek review of the antidumping order.tianjin magnesium international tmi,a foreign exporter of magnesium produced in china,and magnesium usm,a domestic producer of magnesium,requested that commerce review tmi sales.from june,to may,commerce solicited comments and information from the parties,including tmi business records,surrogate value and country selection,and freight rates.
on june,commerce released its preliminary results for the review.pure magnesium from the people republic of china preliminary results of the antidumping duty administrative review,fed.reg.dep t of commerce june.as part of its nonmarket economy review,commerce constructed a normal value for magnesium by creating surrogate values for the raw materials used in the manufacturing process.it considered ferrosilicon,fluorite powder,dolomite,flux,and coal to be direct materials,and it included them directly in the calculation of normal value.however,it did not include a surrogate value for steel retorts,because it did not regard the retorts as direct materials.instead,it treated the retorts as indirect materials and accounted for the cost of the retorts as manufacturing overhead.
in a memorandum accompanying the preliminary results,commerce explained why it classified retorts as indirect inputs and accounted for them as a component of overhead rather than as direct materials pure magnesium from the people republic of china,fed.reg,itadoc,issues decision memorandum,at comment dep t of commerce december.first,commerce explained that retorts are not physically incorporated into the final product.while noting that retorts are necessary to the production process,commerce stated that they are more similar to a kiln or furnace,the costs of which commerce generally treats as manufacturing overhead.commerce also found that retorts are reusable and are not replaced so regularly as to represent a direct factor rather than overhead.finally,commerce found that it was unclear how retorts are typically treated in the industry.
following the preliminary results,usm continued to argue that retorts should be classified as direct materials rather than as overhead.in the final results,however,commerce stood by its classification,explaining that the retorts are best classified as overhead because they are not physically incorporated into the final product and are replaced too infrequently to be a direct material.commerce concluded that retorts are not an input added into the production process rather,they are manufacturing equipment,like an oven or crucible,all of which are necessary components of the production line to produce pure magnesium.consequently,commerce declined to treat retorts as a direct material.
after the closing of the administrative record in the review,usm sought to submit new evidence contradicting one of the answers tmi provided to commerce.usm contended that the new evidence was indicative of fraud on tmi part.commerce rejected usm submission as untimely.the trade court,however,remanded the case to commerce for consideration of the new evidence.
on remand,commerce found that usm newly submitted evidence did not constitute prima facie evidence of fraud.commerce also found that the new evidence did not call into question its finding that retorts are properly treated as factory overhead.
the trade court affirmed commerce remand results.magnesium llc united states,supp.int l trade.after reviewing the financial records of tmi supplier,the court sustained commerce conclusion that the supplier did not treat retorts as a direct material.the court also upheld commerce finding that the evidence was inconclusive as to whether the industry as a whole treated retorts as a direct material input.and the court held that commerce was right in its claim that treating the retorts as an indirect material is consistent with its past practice of characterizing materials as overhead when they are not physically incorporated into the final product and are replaced too infrequently to be a direct material.
usm appealed to this court from the trade court judgment.
commerce determinations in an antidumping duty case must be upheld unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i.substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consol.edison nlrb.
in conducting substantial evidence review of commerce determinations,we apply the same standard of review that the trade court used in reviewing the administrative record.downhole pipe,united states,fed.cir.as we have explained,however,we will not ignore the informed opinion of the court of international trade.diamond sawblades mfrs.coalition united states,fed.cir.quoting suramerica de aleaciones laminadas,united states,fed.cir.
usm argues that substantial evidence does not support commerce decision to classify the retorts as overhead rather than as direct materials.usm contends,first,that tmi supplier characterized retorts as a direct cost,as shown by its books and records,and that commerce should have based its determination on that data from tmi supplier.in support of its argument,usm points to three documents of tmi supplier,all from december the supplier cost sheet,the material out specification sheet,and the cost of production subledger.
the supplier cost sheet is a document detailing the expenditures of tmi supplier.it includes both total and unit costs of a variety of different materials essential to the production of magnesium.in the category of raw material,the chart shows cost breakdowns for fesi ferrosilicon,dolomite,flux,fluorite powder,sulfur powder,and sulfuric acid.retorts are not included within the category of raw material,but are listed separately.
like the supplier cost sheet,the material out specification sheet details the supplier expenditures.the material out specification sheet separately lists the costs for retorts along with the costs for the common ingredients,materials,and equipment used in processing magnesium.
the cost of production subledger,which contains financial information,includes entries for a number of items that it describes as materials consumption,a category that includes raw materials,retorts,certain equipment used in the manufacturing process,and certain other itemized expenses.
usm argues that these documents show that the internal accounting records of tmi magnesium supplier characterized retorts as a direct input.it argues that the retorts were not characterized as accessory expenses,indirect materials,and were not characterized as manufacturing expenses,equipment.therefore,usm argues,tmi supplier necessarily treated retorts as direct material inputs,not as overhead.
commerce rejected that interpretation of the documents.instead,commerce noted that tmi supplier grouped other expenses together with retorts,even though those other items are not considered material inputs.accordingly,commerce concluded that the fact that tmi supplier lists retorts in the cost of production subledger does not indicate that they are a direct material,but rather part of the cost of production.
the trade court agreed with commerce interpretation of the supplier documents.the court noted that at first blush,the description materials consumption in the cost of production subledger might indicate that the listed items were direct inputs,but an examination of the nature of the entries shows that they are not.thus,although the subledger lists retorts among the items classified as materials consumption,it also includes other items under that category that are clearly not direct materials,such as crucible,packing,and accessory expense.likewise,the cost sheet does not include retorts under the category of raw material.in light of that evidence,the trade court concluded that commerce permissibly found that tmi supplier did not treat retorts as a direct material.
commerce findings as to the supplier treatment of retorts are supported by substantial evidence.the documents are not definitive,and commerce reading of them is plausible.
the documents that usm highlights contain line items that range from items that are plainly direct materials to others that are plainly not.given that retorts are not listed as raw materials,and that retorts are grouped together with other expenses that are plainly not direct materials,it was reasonable for commerce to conclude that the records do not show that tmi supplier treated retorts as direct inputs.we will not the agency choice between plausible interpretations of record evidence,particularly in light of the trade court conclusion that commerce analysis of the record materials was reasonable.in re jolley,fed.cir.
usm next argues that in classifying the retorts as indirect materials,commerce unjustifiably departed from its prior practice in similar cases.in usm view,commerce abandoned its prior reliance on a test for distinguishing between indirect materials,which are accounted for as overhead,and direct materials whether the input is physically incorporated into the final product the input contribution to the production process and finished product the relative cost of the input and,the way the cost of the input is typically treated in the industry.certain steel nails from the people republic of china,fed.reg,itadoc,issues decision memorandum,at comment dep t of commerce.the government responds that commerce has never followed such a strict test,but instead has characterized materials as direct or indirect depending on a variety of relevant factors.
we agree with the government.in distinguishing between direct materials and overhead,commerce has not confined the inquiry to particular defined factors,but instead has employed a totality of the circumstances test.for example,in the certain steel nails case,after summarizing the factors considered in previous determinations,commerce cautioned that 
as demonstrated by the variety of considerations,there is no conclusive test for reaching the appropriate classification of inputs that are not easily distinguished on their face as direct materials or overhead.further,contrary to petitioner assertion that meeting any one of these factors demonstrates that an input is a direct material,the department instead finds that it is the totality of the evidence that must guide its decision in each case.
certain steel nails,issues decision memorandum,at comment.
in some investigations,such as citric acid and certain citrate salts,commerce has made findings with regard to all of the four factors that usm cites.fed.reg,itadoc,issues decision memorandum,at comment dep t of commerce.in others,commerce has focused on individual factors that appeared significant in the particular investigation.for example,in certain steel nails,commerce based its classification of dies as indirect materials on the fact that dies are not consumed on a directly proportional basis,but are reused until they have worn out and can no longer be used.issues decision memorandum,at comment.in another case,diamond sawblades and parts thereof from the people republic of china,commerce relied on the lifespan of molds in determining whether they were properly classified as indirect materials,as well as the fact that graphite molds were partially incorporated into the final product.fed.reg,itadoc,issues decision memorandum,at comment dep t of commerce may,
in this case,commerce relied primarily on two factors the fact that the retorts were not physically incorporated into the final product,and the fact that the retorts were not replaced frequently.commerce focus on those factors was neither inconsistent with its past practices in analogous cases nor unreasonable as a way of distinguishing between direct and indirect materials.as long as its analysis was reasonable,as it was here,commerce was not required to examine and rely on every factor that it has used in the past.see bridgestone,united states,supp.int l trade commerce is not bound by the test and has discretion to rely on various criteria to value factors of production.
usm next argues that commerce erred in finding that retorts are replaced too infrequently to be treated as a direct input.citing commerce decision in citric acid,usm suggests that in the past commerce has required an item to have at least one year of useful life in order to be classified as overhead.in that investigation,however,commerce noted that the resins at issue were used for more than one year it concluded that they were therefore properly treated as indirect materials.commerce did not create a rule of thumb that items replaced more often than once per year must be treated as direct materials.in fact,commerce has found factory items having a useful life much shorter than the retorts in this case to be properly categorized as indirect materials whose costs should be treated as overhead.in certain new pneumatic tires tires from the people republic of china,commerce characterized curing bladders used in tire manufacturing as overhead when the record evidence showed that they were replaced as frequently as once every two to eight days.fed.reg,itadoc,issues decision memorandum,at comment dep t of commerce.
usm also criticizes commerce comparison of the retorts with t
