adrian rivera and adrian rivera maynez enterprises collectively,rivera appeal from a divided decision by the international trade commission,finding no violation of section of the tariff act of,based on the commission holding of invalidity of certain asserted claims of rivera patent patent,filed july,titled pod adaptor system for single service beverage brewers.in re certain beverage brewing capsules,components thereof,and products containing the same,inv.april,final beverage capsules and beverage capsules dissent.
because substantial evidence supports the commission holding that all asserted claims are invalid for lack of written description,we affirm.we need not,and do not,reach any of the alternative grounds for affirmance.
background 
a.the disclosure in the patent 
the patent describes coffee machines falling into two general categories.some machines have brewing chambers configured to receive pods which are small,flattened filter packages of beverage extract,while other machines are configured to accommodate larger,beverage filter cartridges.patent,ll.the keurig system,which uses,is an example of the latter system.
the patent describes the keurig brewer in some,and notes that it inherently limits the use of the machine to cartridges,id.at,ll,so that users of the keurig machine would have to purchase a different machine to brew beverage from pods,which are typically somewhat flattened disc shaped filter paper packets containing coffee,id.at,ll.because multiple machines are inconvenient and,the patent identifies a need for brewers configured for cartridges to also be used to brew beverages from pods.id.at,ll.
the explicitly defines a pod as follows as used herein,the term pod is a broad term and shall have its ordinary meaning and shall include,but not be limited to,a package formed of a water permeable material and containing an amount of ground coffee or other beverage therein.id.at.
as explained in the specification,the patent to solve two problems the incompatibility between and systems and the lack of flavor from brewed coffee resulting from the lack of tamping,contraction of the coffee.id.at,ll.the claims at issue here are only concerned with the first problem and rivera asserted solution to it.the patent abstract explains that t he assembly is especially designed for brewing pods in brewers configured for beverage extract cartridges.the invention more particularly relates to an adaptor assembly configured to effect operative compatibility between a single serve beverage brewer and beverage pods.id.at,ll.
the patent includes several embodiments to its purposes.every embodiment in the patent shows a receptacle,adapted in ways to receive a discrete water permeable,pod.for example,the embodiment shown in figure,reproduced below,shows a pod adaptor assembly,which generally comprises a receptacle with a substantially circular base and sidewalls extending upwardly from the base.id.at,ll.the base has an annular raised portion extending upwardly from a lower surface of the base,which provides a raised support surface for a pod so that the pod does not contact and possibly block the opening for brewed coffee to flow through.id.at,ll.
tabular or graphical material not displayable at this time.
the remaining embodiments either show only a receptacle without a filter,id.at,or show a discrete pod with filter sitting inside the receptacle,id.at.see also showing prior art.
the patent was filed on july,claiming a pod adaptor assembly with a receptacle adapted to provide a support surface for a pod,or a pod adaptor assembly with a housing having an interior region adapted to receive a beverage pod,or a brewing chamber for a beverage pod with a housing adapted to receive the beverage pod.app x at.after almost seven years of prosecution and multiple amendments,the patent issued.none of the claims as issued included any reference to a pod,pod adaptor assembly,or brewing chamber for a beverage pod.instead,the relevant claims call for a container adapted to hold brewing material.representative claim reads as follows 
a beverage brewer,comprising 
a brewing chamber 
a container,disposed within the brewing chamber and adapted to hold brewing material while brewed by a beverage brewer,the container comprising 
a receptacle configured to receive the brewing material and 
wherein the receptacle includes 
a base,having an interior surface and an exterior surface,wherein at least a portion of the base is disposed a predetermined distance above a surface of the brewing chamber,and 
at least one sidewall extending upwardly from the interior surface of the base,
wherein the receptacle has at least one passageway that provides fluid flow from an interior of the receptacle to an exterior of the receptacle 
wherein the cover is adapted to sealingly engage with a top edge of the at least one sidewall,the cover including an opening,and 
wherein the container is adapted to accept input fluid through the opening and to provide a corresponding outflow of fluid through the passageway 
an inlet port,adapted to provide the input fluid to the container and 
a structure,disposed below the base 
wherein the predetermined distance is such that a tip of the structure does not penetrate the exterior surface of the base.
procedural history 
on september,rivera filed a complaint with the international trade commission commission,alleging that solofill,llc solofill was importing beverage capsules that infringed claims and of the patent,in violation of section.rivera withdrew its allegations with respect to claims and,leaving currently pending claims,and.solofill and beverage capsules are made to fit into a keurig brewer,and include an integrated mesh filter surrounding a space designed to accept loose coffee grounds.
in an initial decision,the administrative law judge alj held that rivera had established both the and economic prongs of the domestic industry requirement,and solofill had not proved invalidity of the patent.however,the alj found no violation of,concluding that rivera failed to show infringement.in particular,the alj held that solofill did not directly infringe because solofill only imported the cartridges,and the claims required the combination of solofill accused cartridges and a keurig type brewer.the alj also held that solofill was not liable for induced or contributory infringement because it did not have knowledge of the patent,and therefore lacked the required mens rea for indirect infringement.
on review,the commission also concluded that there was no violation of,but for different reasons.the commission held that,inter alia,asserted claims,and,were invalid for lack of written description,and that claims and were additionally invalid as by patent to beaulieu beaulieu.beverage capsules at.commissioner kieff,concluding that the specification as filed satisfied the written description requirement.commissioner kieff reasoned that the specification gave a definition to the word pod,which included both closed packets and open packages of a water permeable material containing ground coffee.beverage capsule dissent at.

written description 
the specification of a patent as filed must contain a written description of the invention.a specification has an adequate written description when it reasonably conveys to those skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date of the patent.ariad,eli lilly,fed.cir.en banc.t he test requires an objective inquiry into the four corners of the specification from the perspective of a person of ordinary skill in the art to show that the inventor actually invented the invention claimed.id.
