e j gallo winery gallo appeals from the district court denial of a preliminary injunction to enjoin andina licores andina from proceeding with litigation in ecuador.we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to a.we reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to grant the injunction.
gallo,a large winery headquartered in modesto,california,entered into a distributorship agreement with andina licores cia ltda,a wine and liquor distributor headquartered in guayaquil,ecuador,in.the distributor later changed its structure to become a corporation and changed its name to andina licores,the in this appeal.
in,gallo and andina executed an updated distributorship agreement,in which andina was substituted for its.both the agreement and the agreement have the same forum selection and clauses in favor of california 
this agreement is entered into under the laws of the state of california,and shall be construed thereunder,and any cause of action arising between the parties,whether under this agreement or otherwise,shall be brought only in a court having jurisdiction and venue at the home office of winery.
in april and may,gallo and andina exchanged letters over various disputes,including whether gallo had delivered three shipments late and whether andina was an exclusive distributor of gallo products.in july,andina appeared before the sixth civil court in guayaquil in connection with its dispute with gallo.although gallo had identified its ecuadorian lawyer in an april,letter to andina,and although andina and gallo had been in a contractual relationship for over years,andina represented to the court that it did not know gallo whereabouts in ecuador.for this reason,andina asked the court to appoint a curador a guardian to act as counsel for gallo and to appear for gallo in any proceedings that andina might file.strangely,andina was allowed to choose this guardian,and andina selected rita yepez de maher yepez,an attorney who apparently had only been admitted to practice law five months earlier.in support of its application to appoint yepez as curador,andina was required to provide affidavits of two people who could swear to yepez reliability and could recommend her.andina submitted the affidavits of a day laborer and a student.
andina filed suit against gallo in the second civil court of guayaquil,ecuador,on august,alleging a violation of decree,which was issued by the ecuadorian military dictatorship in and had been repealed in.the decree was intended to protect ecuadorians who acted as agents,distributors,or representatives of foreign companies.article of the decree maintained that the parties to a distributorship agreement between an ecuadorian distributor and a foreign manufacturer could not include a unilateral right of termination in the agreement.additionally,the decree stated that any legal action brought under the law was to be heard by a judge at the ecuadorian company main residence,thus potentially invalidating all forum selection clauses.the decree also provided for a verbal summary trial,in which periods for discovery or response were drastically shortened and in which there was no opportunity to examine and witnesses.in the event that a foreign manufacturer violated article,it was liable to the local distributor for damages,which were calculated by multiplying a distributor annual revenue from the agreement in the most recent fiscal year by the number of years of the distributor relationship.decree was repealed by the national congress of ecuador in by law.the preamble to law stated that decree was contrary to the treaty of the world trade organization.
andina sued under the decree in spite of its revocation several years before.invoking the decree method of damage calculation,andina claimed in damages.it also invoked the decree verbal summary trial procedures,which required gallo to appear and assert its defenses before september.the period to submit evidence was limited to six business days from september to september.the ecuadorian court was not required to consider any defense or evidence that gallo did not submit within these time limitations.
the ecuadorian court officially appointed yepez as the curador on september.yepez mailed a letter dated september to gallo in california.the letter,written in spanish,informed gallo of the lawsuit in ecuador,of her appointment as gallo lawyer,and of the allegations in the complaint.however,the letter did not include a copy of the complaint and did not make any mention of the expedited trial procedure.gallo declares that it did not receive the letter until september.
without having made any other contact with gallo,yepez made an appearance on behalf of gallo on september.yepez asserted some defenses on gallo behalf but did not assert a defense based on the forum selection clause.finally,on september,yepez called gallo headquarters and informed it of the lawsuit.gallo called its quito attorney,whose name had been given to andina in april,and eventually retained xavier castro to represent it in the guayaquil action.castro was unable to inform the ecuadorian court of the forum selection clause defense before the september deadline,and he did not have time to present any evidence before the close of evidence period.
on october,gallo filed suit in california state court,seeking declaratory relief,injunctive relief,damages,and punitive damages.although andina was required by the agreement to appoint ct corporation as its agent for service of process,it had failed to do so thus,gallo served andina in ecuador.andina removed the case to the district court.after various motions activity,andina filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.gallo opposed the motion to dismiss and filed a for a preliminary injunction restraining andina from pursuing the action in ecuador and issuance of a letter rogatory.that is the subject of this appeal.
on june,the district court denied both motions.the district court held that andina had consented to jurisdiction therefore,it denied andina motion to dismiss.the court also denied gallo motion for a preliminary injunction,basing its decision largely on considerations of international comity.
in the meantime,a dizzying array of judgments,appeals,and procedural motions continued in ecuador.on august,the second civil court dismissed the action in ecuador,holding that the forum selection clause was valid and that the claim should be heard in california.additionally,the district court held that andina had improperly invoked the curador procedure.andina appealed.
on august,andina filed another lawsuit in the civil court to disqualify the second civil court.because of this filing,the underlying action was temporarily removed from the second civil court pending a decision by the civil court.two weeks later,andina filed a motion in the civil court to annul the second civil court august decision.this motion was denied on september.five days later,andina filed another motion before the civil court to revoke the order denying the annulment motion.the court denied this motion one week later.undaunted,on september,andina filed a motion before the civil court to annul two second civil court rulings in favor of gallo.these motions are,apparently,still pending.
on september,andina filed yet another motion in the civil court,seeking to interrogate the judge of the second civil court who had ruled in favor of gallo,judge ukles cornejo bustos.eventually,on november,andina filed a complaint in the superior court of justice of guayaquil,asserting claims for damages against judge bustos.we understand that this motion and complaint are still pending in ecuador.
the district court denial of a preliminary injunction is normally reviewed for an abuse of discretion.walczak epl prolong,cir.however,an injunction presents particularly complex legal issues,especially because of international comity concerns.although our overall review is for an abuse of discretion,t he district court interpretation of the underlying legal principles is subject to de novo review and a district court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.sw.voter registration educ.project shelley,cir en banc.we will reverse a denial of a preliminary injunction where the district court abused its discretion or based its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.sammartano first jud.dist.court,cir.
courts derive the ability to enter an injunction from their equitable powers.such injunctions allow the court to restrain a party subject to its jurisdiction from proceeding in a foreign court in circumstances that are unjust.the injunction has deep roots in english law.traceable to at least england,it first appeared in the form of a writ of prohibition by the common law courts to the ecclesiastical courts to prevent their expansive jurisdictional assertions.see david raack,a history of injunctions in england before.the injunction operates in personam the american court enjoins the claimant,not the foreign court.

however,seattle totems did not adopt the unterweser analysis as anything other than instructive.while we referred to two fifth circuit cases,it is unclear how much of their analysis we adopted.we considered the policies and cases referred to in our opinion,but affirmed the district court holding based on equitable balance.seattle totems,at.significantly,seattle totems left many questions unanswered,as it does not elucidate a precise framework for courts to apply when deciding whether to issue an injunction.for example,it is silent as to the interplay between the traditional preliminary injunction test and the injunction test,and as to the weight to be given to international comity.we now turn to these issues.
the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve rights pending resolution of the merits of the case by the trial.big country foods,bd.of,cir.a preliminary injunction is appropriate where plaintiffs demonstrate either a likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in their favor.shelley,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the irreducible minimum is that the moving party demonstrate a fair chance of success on the merits or questions serious enough to require litigation.no chance of success at all will not suffice.sports form,united press int l,cir internal punctuation and citations omitted.the degree to which this test is applicable to injunctions is unclear,and seattle totems makes no mention of it.indeed,seattle totems may actually have involved a permanent injunction,although it is not clear from the opinion.
the suitability of an injunction involves different considerations from the suitability of other preliminary injunctions.an injunction,by its nature,will involve detailed analysis of international comity.often,as here,the injunction will be defensive in nature.gallo has requested the preliminary injunction because of andina potentially prejudicial,vexatious and oppressive proceedings in ecuador.but should gallo also need to prove a likelihood of success on the merits of the breach of contract claim in order to receive an injunction that is,does our usual test for a preliminary injunction apply,or is a modified analysis required for injunctions while our cases are not clear on this issue,we conclude that the more appropriate approach is that enunciated by the fifth circuit to the extent the traditional preliminary injunction test is appropriate,we only need address whether the injunction seeker showed a significant likelihood of success on the merits.the merits in this case,however,are about whether the injunction seeker has demonstrated that the factors specific to an injunction weigh in favor of granting that injunction here.karaha bodas.perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,cir.
thus,we hold that gallo need not meet our usual test of a likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying claim to obtain an injunction against andina to halt the ecuadorian proceedings.rather,gallo need only demonstrate that the factors specific to an injunction weigh in favor of granting the injunction.for purposes of this action,we may rely on any of the unterweser factors if it applies to the case and if the impact on comity is tolerable.this test,we conclude,is consistent with seattle totems.
in applying this test,we believe the first step in determining whether an injunction is appropriate is to determine whether or not the parties and the issues are the same,and whether or not the first action is dispositive of the action to be enjoined.see sun world,lizarazu olivarria,citations omitted inferring such a test from the discussion in seattle totems see also paramedics electromedicina comercial,ltda ge medical.info,cir using this test quaak klynveld peat marwick goerdeler bedrijfsrevisoren,cir same george bermann,the use of injunctions in international litigation,colum.transnat l,stating that courts will not consider issuing injunctions in the absence of parallel local and foreign actions between the same parties over the same claim.
the district court concluded that the claims were not the same because the california and ecuador cases arose from different acts.this conclusion was in error.in the ecuadorian court,andina sued for breach of contract.in the district court,gallo sought,among other things,a declaration that gallo did not breach the distributorship agreement.therefore,all the issues before the court in the ecuador action are before the court in the california action.
andina contends that the claims are not the same because enjoining the ecuador action would deprive it of its right to pursue its claims under ecuadorian law.not so.first,it is not clear that andina has claims under ecuadorian law,as the contract contains a clause in favor of california.second,to the degree that ecuadorian law does apply,federal courts are capable of applying it to andina claims.see.see also republic of the philippines marcos,cir en banc holding that questions of foreign law are not beyond the capacity of our courts.
we conclude that the parties and claims are the same.
turning to another aspect we thought instructive in seattle totems,foreign litigation may be enjoined when it would frustrate a policy of the forum issuing the injunction.seattle totems,at,see also in re unterweser reederei gmbh,at.gallo contends that an injunction is necessary to preserve the united states policy encouraging enforcement of forum selection clauses.although the district court held that the forum selection clause was valid and enforceable,it also held that the policy of enforcement was not so compelling as to justify the encroachment of one court on the jurisdiction of the other.
