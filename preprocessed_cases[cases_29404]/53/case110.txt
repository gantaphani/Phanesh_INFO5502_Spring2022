these consolidated arise from a challenge to the united states sanctions prohibiting both travel to and the unlicensed donation of humanitarian medical supplies to iraq.we affirm the district court decision that bertram sacks has standing to challenge the ban on travel and that the travel ban regulation was validly promulgated.sacks fails,however,to demonstrate a concrete and imminent likelihood that he will be penalized for violations of the restriction on medical donations.therefore,his challenge to the restriction on medical donations does not fulfill the constitutional requirements of standing and ripeness.we also affirm the district court holding that the office of foreign assets control ofac regulation in effect at the time prohibited the govern ment from referring sacks unpaid penalty to a private collection agency.
background 
bertram sacks traveled to iraq nine times between and in violation of sanctions the united states imposed against iraq following the invasion of kuwait.according to sacks amended complaint,the twelve years of united states and united nations sanctions were a dire time for iraqi civilians,marked by malnutrition,high rates of infant and child mortality,and shortages of medicine sacks,and an advocacy group called voices in the wilderness voices,opposed these sanctions on humanitarian grounds.in an effort to draw attention to the effect of the sanctions,sacks and other voices members traveled to iraq repeatedly while the sanctions were in effect,bringing with them medicine and medical supplies for which they had failed to procure an export license.they did so in knowing violation of the united states regulations prohibiting travel and the sending of unlicensed humanitarian donations to iraq.sacks has been assessed a penalty by the federal government for one violation arising from these trips,and he seeks relief from enforcement of that penalty.
iraqi sanctions 
to place this case in context,it is necessary to review the history of the iraqi sanctions regime.on august,one day after saddam hussein armies invaded kuwait,president george bush issued executive order,which declared a national emergency and imposed sweeping prohibitions on numerous economic and social transactions with iraq.four days later,the united nations security council passed resolution,which called on all member states to prevent their nationals from engaging in economic and financial transactions with iraq except for humanitarian donations of food and medical supplies.prohibited activities included 
c the sale or supply by their nationals or from their territories or using their flag vessels of any commodities or products,including weapons or any other military equipment,whether or not originating in their territories but not including supplies intended strictly for medical purposes,and,in humanitarian circumstances,foodstuffs,to any person or body in iraq or kuwait and any activities by their nationals or in their territories which promote or are calculated to promote such sale or supply of such commodities or products 
res,doc.following passage of this resolution,president bush replaced the earlier executive order with executive order,a more thorough and detailed set of sanctions,which likewise included an exception for humanitarian donations of food and medicine.it prohibited,among other things 
b the exportation to iraq,directly or indirectly,of any goods,technology or services either i from the united states,or ii requiring the issuance of a license by a federal agency,or any activity that promotes or is intended to promote such exportation,except donations of articles intended to relieve human suffering,such as food and supplies intended strictly for medical purposes 
d any transaction by a united states person relating to travel by any united states citizen or permanent resident alien to iraq,or to activities by any such person within iraq,after the date of this order,other than transactions necessary to effect i such person departure from iraq,ii travel and activities for the conduct of the official business of the federal government or the united nations,or iii travel for journalistic activity by persons regularly employed in such capacity by a organization 
for the president authority to impose these sanctions,executive order relied upon the international emergency economic powers act,et,and the united nations participation act.at.the executive order also made clear that the sanctions described therein could be modified or limited by future regulation,and authorized the treasury secretary to promulgate whatever regulations were necessary to carry out its proscriptions.id.
a month after its initial resolution on iraq,the united nations security council became concerned that the iraqi government was diverting donated humanitarian food and medical supplies to its military.scor,at,doc.it therefore passed a new resolution recommending,among other steps to be taken,that medical supplies should be exported under the strict supervision of the government of the exporting state or by appropriate humanitarian agencies.res,doc.when the united states congress engaged the issue that november,it authorized the president to continue the embargo and sanctions embodied in executive order,but also required that transactions involving foodstuffs exempted in humanitarian circumstances be conducted pursuant to the later security council resolution,resolution.iraq sanctions act of,stat.
in january,ofac,an agency within the department of treasury responsible for coordinating international sanctions,published a final rule in the federal register establishing the iraqi sanctions regulations the iraqi sanctions,codified at et.these regulations included the two at issue here,which prohibited all united states persons from conducting any transaction relating to travel by any citizen or permanent resident alien to iraq,or to activities within iraq,except for journalists,united states or united nations officials,and those assisting american citizens or permanent residents to flee iraq the travel ban and,which banned the export of goods,services,and technology to iraq but retained an exception for donated foodstuffs in humanitarian circumstances,and donated supplies intended strictly for medical purposes,the exportation of which has been specifically licensed the medicine restrictions.ofac also established a licensing program to enable humanitarian donations of food and medical supplies,id,repealed by,and a process for assessing penalties against those who violated the sanctions,id.the iraqi sanctions remained in place until,soon after the invasion of iraq in,the united nations lifted all trade restrictions against iraq,res,doc.may,and ofac issued a general license permitting all transactions that previously had been prohibited,including unlicensed humanitarian donations,june,codified at.
assessment of the penalty 
following a november humanitarian trip to iraq in which sacks participated,ofac issued sacks a prepenalty notice,pursuant to.the prepenalty notice accused sacks,other individuals,and voices of violating the iraqi sanctions in its violations section,the prepenalty notice described your and voices exportation of donated goods,including medical supplies and toys,to iraq absent specific prior authorization by ofac.it then listed ten specific violations.six of these violations accused voices of exporting medical supplies other goods absent prior specific license or other authorization.sacks was individually charged with only one violation 
between on or about november,handleman,mullins,sacks and zito engaged in currency transactions to iraq absent prior license or other authorization from ofac.these currency transactions included,but are not limited to,the purchase of food,lodging,ground transportation,and incidentals 
the prepenalty notice proposed a penalty for sacks and the other individuals described in the sixth charge,and a penalty for voices for each of the six violations.it further provided sacks an opportunity to respond to the charges in writing,which he did.although he was individually charged only with violating the travel ban,in his written response sacks admitted that he had violated the medicine restrictions,as well as the travel ban,stating,you are correct to say in your prepenalty letter that i brought medical supplies and toys to iraq absent prior ofac approval.although he did not explicitly address the travel charge,the statement that he brought medical supplies and toys to iraq is an implied admission that he had traveled to iraq.
years later,ofac issued sacks a formal penalty notice,which described his prior admission ambiguously you admitted the notice allegation in count that you exported goods to iraq absent prior ofac approval.citing his willful violation of the iraqi sanctions,ofac imposed the full penalty against him and demanded that it be paid within thirty days.when sacks did not pay the penalty,he received a letter in august from the ocwen federal bank,which sought to collect the debt including interest and late behalf of the united states department of treasury.
procedural history 
seeking to prevent collection of the penalty,sacks brought suit in the united states district court for the western district of washington against ofac and its director,richard newcomb collectively,ofac.he sought declaratory and injunctive relief on the theory that the medicine restrictions and the travel ban lacked statutory authority and violated principles of international law.sacks also alleged that ofac claims against him were.the district court granted ofac motion to dismiss,holding that the travel ban was validly promulgated and enforceable that,regardless of whether sacks had standing to challenge the medicine restrictions,they too were validly promulgated that international law did not render these regulations unconstitutional and that enforcement of the penalty was not.however,the court held that ofac was prohibited by its own regulations from referring the unpaid penalty to a collection agency.
sacks appeals the district court dismissal only on the ground that the two regulations were invalidly promulgated ofac the district court determination that it could not use an outside collection agency to collect the penalty and was required to refer the penalty to the department of justice for collection in a federal civil suit.we have jurisdiction over these consolidated appeals pursuant to,and we now affirm.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of a defendant motion to dismiss.see decker advantage fund,cir.standing is a question of law reviewed de novo,see myers,city and county of san francisco,cir,as are challenges that an agency regulations exceed its statutory authority,see ashcroft,cir.on,we review the district court interpretation of ofac enforcement regulation de novo,according deference to ofac interpretation of its own regulations so long as that interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.see league of wilderness mountains biodiversity project forsgren,cir.
iii.standing 
sacks challenges two provisions within the iraqi sanctions the travel ban and the medical restrictions.we must first determine whether he has standing to assert these claims.s tanding is a threshold question which we must resolve before proceeding to the merits.los angeles county bar ass eu,cir.this principle is grounded in the case or controversy requirement of article iii of the united states constitution if sacks suffered no caused by the travel ban or medicine restrictions themselves,then any opinion we render on that provision would be merely advisory.see scott pasadena unified sch,cir.
the requirements of article iii standing are 
a plaintiff must show it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.article iii standing requires the plaintiff to establish standing for each challenge he wishes to bring and each form of relief he seeks.see id.to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,sacks must allege facts in his amended complaint that,if proven,would confer standing upon him.warren fox family worldwide,cir see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d noting that,at this stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice.therefore,we must determine whether sacks amended complaint identifies an injury caused by each of the two regulations that is both concrete and actual or imminent.
travel ban 
sacks has standing to challenge the travel ban and the government does not contend otherwise.the prepenalty notice that explained the charge against him explicitly mentioned his violation of the prohibition on travel to and travel transactions within iraq.where the plaintiff is himself an object of the action or forgone action at issue there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury,and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.lujan,at.the government,through the ocwen federal bank,now seeks to collect a civil penalty from sacks for violating the travel ban.a civil fine is a pecuniary injury,and p ecuniary injury is clearly a sufficient basis for standing.cent.water conserv.dist.epa,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
medicine restrictions 
sacks challenges only the facial validity of the restrictions on unlicensed medical donations,and not the application of the licensing regime.sacks concedes that he did not apply for an ofac license to donate humanitarian medical supplies to iraq,as allowed.we clarified in united states hugs that a plaintiff failure to apply for an available permit precludes him from challenging the operation of the permitting scheme but not the facial validity of the statute or regulations,cir.sacks therefore lacks standing to challenge the operation of the licensing regime but is not prohibited under hugs from facially challenging the medicine restrictions.
sacks cites three reasons why he satisfies the requirement as to the medicine restrictions he has been actually punished for violating the medicine restrictions he will be called upon to pay the penalties assessed against voices and he legitimately fears future prosecution for openly violating the medicine restrictions.we find none of these to be persuasive.
sacks contends that his penalty was assessed for violation of the medicine restrictions.we disagree.ofac treatment of sacks indicates its belief that penalties were assessed only for the travel ban violation.the penalty notice,while confusing,expressly references count of the earlier notice,which referred only to the travel ban.moreover,it was reasonable for ofac to treat sacks admission that he brought medical supplies to iraq as an admission that he traveled to iraq.as sacks concedes,bringing medical supplies to iraq can be accomplished only by traveling to that country to deliver them.finally,the penalty ultimately levied against sacks was consistent with those proposed in the penalty notice for violating the travel ban in contrast,the proposed penalties for violating the medicine restrictions were per violation.therefore,we conclude that sacks was not penalized for violating the medicine restrictions.
nor does sacks status as a member of voices expose him to liability for the penalties assessed against the organization so as to confer standing.sacks does not suggest that he has standing to challenge the medicine restrictions on voices behalf indeed,voices has already challenged the penalties assessed against it.see office of foreign assets control voices in the wilderness,d.more importantly,nothing in the amended complaint or in the record indicates that sacks has any financial responsibility for voices fine that action against him has been initiated or is imminent or even that ofac has ever turned to individual group members of an unincorporated organization to collect civil fines against the organization.therefore,sacks mere membership in a penalized organization does not create a realistic danger of his sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute operation or enforcement.lso,stroh,cir quoting babbitt united farm workers union,d.
finally,sacks does not face imminent,or even likely,prosecution for violating the medicine restrictions.it is true that the executive order terminating the national emergency in iraq explicitly reserved the government right to bring proceedings based on acts in violation of the sanctions committed before the sanctions expired.exec.order,july.therefore,sacks theoretically may be subject to penalties for taking medicine to iraq,even though the united states has allowed humanitarian medical donations to iraq since may.
however,while it is that an individual need not await prosecution under a law or regulation before challenging it,see babbitt,at.canatella california,cir as amended,we require a genuine threat of imminent prosecution and not merely an imaginary or speculative fear of prosecution.san diego county gun rights comm.reno,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the requirement that a fear of prosecution be fairly certain to confer standing on the plaintiff is informed by the same considerations as the doctrine of ripeness.the ripeness requirement aims to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.abbott laboratories gardner,d,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders,d.as we have previously observed,the constitutional component of the ripeness inquiry,in many cases,coincides squarely with standing injury in fact prong.thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc.therefore,we employ the same test to determine if a plaintiff has established standing based on a fear of prosecution that we use to determine if a case or controversy is sufficiently ripe.
in evaluating the genuineness of a claimed threat of prosecution,we look to whether the plaintiffs have articulated a concrete plan to violate the law in question,whether the prosecuting authorities have communicated a specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings,and the history of past prosecution or enforcement under the challenged statute.
see id.at citing san diego county gun rights comm.at.whether viewed through the lens of standing or ripeness,sacks challenge to the medicine restrictions is not justiciable.
sacks has established two of the requisite elements required to survive the motion to dismiss on standing or ripeness grounds.he had more than a concrete plan to violate the medicine restrictions he admits that he actually did violate them on a number of occasions.see jacobus alaska,cir.he also alleges that ofac has historically targeted other alleged violators of the medicine restrictions,including voices.because,on review of a district court rule b dismissal,we assume all facts alleged in the amended complaint are true,see bassidji goe,cir,these allegations are sufficient to satisfy the first two elements.
sacks fear of prosecution runs aground on the government decision to charge and penalize him for only the violation of the travel ban and not for the medicine restrictions violation.in jacobus alaska,we similarly confronted a plaintiff who feared future prosecution under a repealed statute.the plaintiffs in jacobus had knowingly violated alaska campaign finance laws capping contributions to political parties and volunteer professional services to campaigns.at.in the wake of a district court ruling against the state,the alaska legislature revised its campaign finance laws to remove the offending provisions,but the state continued to argue their legality on appeal.the alaska public offices commission apoc then wrote jacobus indicating that if the law were upheld it reserved the right to prosecute any past violations he had committed,although it would not pursue any enforcement action during the pendency of the litigation.id.at.we held that jacobus faced a genuine threat of imminent prosecution because even though the letter sent to jacobus does not threaten to initiate enforcement proceedings in so many words,it indicates that apoc is only awaiting the outcome of the litigation to initiate such proceedings.id.at.
sacks is in a materially different position than the jacobus plaintiffs.contrary to sacks contention,the government decision to penalize him for only the travel ban violation,when it was fully aware he had also violated the medicine restrictions,indicates that the government does not intend to penalize him for any of his numerous violations of the medicine restrictions.ofac has not taken the step it normally would take to express its intent to penalize sacks and thus preserve its right to do so,by sending him a prepenalty notice.the amended complaint is devoid of any allegations suggesting that ofac has communicated an intent to punish him further.
to demonstrate the requisite specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings,thomas,at,sacks points only to a footnote in ofac motion to dismiss that reads although ofac has not yet acted in response to plaintiff eight other trips to iraq,it reserves the right to do so in the future.while this language is similar to the language used by the agency in jacobus,that alone does not demonstrate that prosecution is imminent.first and foremost,unlike the agency in jacobus,which could not bring charges against the plaintiff because the relevant law had been declared unconstitutional by the district court,nothing has prevented ofac from charging sacks under the medicine restrictions over the last decade.ofac declination to charge him for the medicine restrictions violations during the last eight years,therefore,is a strong indication of its lack of intent to do so in the future.furthermore,the footnote sacks relies on to demonstrate the threat of prosecution does not mention the medicine restrictions at all,but rather references his violation for engaging in transactions.therefore,sacks has failed to demonstrate any specific threat of prosecution for violations of the medicine restrictions.see friends of the earth,at.noting that article iii requires plaintiff injury to be actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.
moreover,it is not clear from the amended complaint that ofac could still bring charges against sacks for violating the medicine restrictions.the relevant statute of limitations for the government to bring proceedings enforcing a civil penalty is five years from the date of the act.see.a plaintiff standing is evaluated as of the date the complaint was filed,in this case january.see bernhardt county of los angeles,cir.the amended complaint does not allege that sacks violated the medicine restrictions after january.the alleged violations are thus likely,diminishing any threat of prosecution that would have supported standing at the of this suit.moreover,even if sacks had more recently violated the medicine restrictions,it is quite possible that the statute of limitations on those violations has also passed,rendering his fears of prosecution moot.see jacobus,at noting that mootness may warrant dismissal where it is absolutely clear that the litigant no longer ha s any need of the judicial protection he seeks quoting adarand constructors,slater,d.
because sacks fails to allege a concrete and imminent caused by the medicine restrictions,this claim is not justiciable both for lack of standing and ripeness.of course,should ofac take action to penalize sacks for violating the medicine restrictions at a later date,he would then have standing to challenge their legitimacy.we therefore do not reach sacks challenge to the district court ruling that the medicine restrictions were validly promulgated.see mustang marketing,chevron products,cir our review is not limited to a consideration of the grounds upon which the district court decided the issues the court can affirm the district court on any grounds supported by the record.
iv.validity of the travel ban 
sacks does not challenge ofac basic authority to restrict travel to iraq at the president direction under the united nations participation act unpa.see a allowing the president to prohibit rail,sea,and air communication with another country in order to comply with united nations directives karpova snow,d,holding that the iraq travel ban is duly authorized by the unpa.instead,he alleges that the travel ban regulation,exceeded the president statutory authority because it indirectly regulated the donation of humanitarian medical supplies,something sacks contends the international emergency economic powers act ieepa forbids the president from doing.because the ieepa imposes no such burden on the president powers when he acts under the unpa,we reject this argument.
the ieepa grants the president authority to unilaterally impose regulations on economic transactions between the united states or its nationals,and foreign countries or their nationals.a.to trigger this authority,the president must declare a national emergency necessitated by an unusual and extraordinary threat.id.however,the president power under the ieepa is constrained it does not include the authority to regulate or prohibit,directly or indirectly donations,by persons subject to the jurisdiction of the united states,of articles,such as food,clothing and medicine,intended to be used to relieve human suffering,unless the president determines that such donations would seriously impair his ability to address the emergency or would endanger the safety of american combat forces engaged in hostilities.id.b.the president,acting under the ieepa,is also precluded from regulating the export of postal,telegraphic,telephonic and personal communications information or informational materials,including magazines,photographs,and artwork and travel to or from a country.id.b.
as the district court recognized,however,the ieepa is not the lone source of the president power to enact economic sanctions.executive order,which instructed the treasury secretary or his designate ofac to promulgate regulations enforcing the economic sanctions against iraq,derived its power from both the ieepa and the unpa.ofac contends that congress did not intend the ieepa limits to interfere with the president authority under the unpa.our review of the structure and plain language of the two statutes convinces us that ofac is correct.
the economic restrictions authorized by the ieepa and the related limits on that authority are confined to a particular circumstance the declared national emergency.see b the authorities granted to the president by section of this title may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared id.b the authority granted to the president by this section does not include the authority to regulate humanitarian aid,travel.emphasis added.the ieepa also requires the president to consult with congress before acting,and to regularly consult and report to congress after exercising his authority.id.by contrast,the unpa allows the president to impose sanctions that are more,without any congressional review and n otwithstanding the provisions of any other law.when called upon to enforce a security council directive,the unpa authorizes the president 
to the extent necessary to apply such measures to investigate,regulate or prohibit,in whole or in part,economic relations or rail,sea,air,postal,telegraphic,radio and other means of communication between any foreign country or national thereof and the united states or any person subject to the jurisdiction thereof.
id.the unpa thus authorizes the president to take measures when enforcing a security council resolution,such as limiting postal communication and air travel,that he could not take independently by declaring a national emergency.sacks proposed interpretation would treat congress passage of the ieepa in as a partial sub silentio repeal of the unpa.we are reluctant to conclude that a statute has been repealed without a clear statement from congress e ven when two statutes are in some conflict,repeal is to be regarded as implied only if necessary to make the law work,and even then,only to the minimum extent necessary.ins,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
we refuse to read congress passage of the ieepa as repealing key provisions of the unpa.proper functioning of the ieepa does not depend on a repealing of the unpa,since the two statutes authorize presidential actions in unique,albeit sometimes overlapping,situations.reading the statutes to avoid a conflict maintains the complete viability of both statutes and is most faithful to congress plain language.
the legislative history of the ieepa and the unpa supports our view.the ieepa was passed by congress to counter the perceived abuse of emergency controls by presidents to unilaterally sanction foreign governments or interfere with international trade in,peacetime situations.the senate committee report explains 
the bill is a response to two developments first,extensive use by presidents of emergency authority under section b of the trading with the enemy act of to regulate both domestic and international economic transactions unrelated to a declared state of emergency,and second,passage of the national emergencies act of which provides safeguards for the role of congress in declaring and terminating national emergencies 
at,as reprinted in.the senate report then describes the four national emergencies that were in effect in,two of which had been in place for more than years.id.at.
by contrast,the senate report accompanying passage of the unpa acknowledged that the statute granted extraordinary powers to the president to enforce united nations sanctions as quickly as possible,but stated the committee belief that such powers were necessary to fulfill the united states obligations under the united nations charter and make international sanctions effective.as the house report states,
the committee realizes that the powers proposed to be granted to the president under this section are very great.however,the basic decision in this regard was made when the charter was ratified and this provision is simply a necessary corollary to our membership in this organization the.the committee also believes that the security council must be placed in the most effective position possible to act under article since the prompt and effective application of economic and diplomatic sanctions by all the united nations or even the threat or possibility thereof may avoid the necessity for the use of the armed forces available to the security council.
the better prepared this country is to participate promptly in action of this kind,the more effective will be the security council and the more hope there will be that the united nations may serve its major purpose,namely,the prevention of armed conflict.
cong.this legislative history confirms what the plain text of the statute indicates that the ieepa significantly restricted the president emergency authority but did not intend to alter the president very great powers to impose economic sanctions enforcing a united nations resolution.
nor does the ieepa legislative history indicate,as sacks contends,that the statute was intended to codify and make binding international law principles on humanitarian relief that had emerged since the passage of the unpa thirty years earlier.neither the ieepa nor its legislative history mentions international law or a universal right to medical supplies.congress only indication of its intent in exempting medical supplies from the president emergency powers is a statement in the senate report that the exemption would enable persons to make humanitarian contributions in accordance with their conscience,at.sacks claim of congressional intent is further belied by the ieepa provision allowing the president to unilaterally regulate,or even prohibit,humanitarian medical supplies simply by declaring that doing so is necessary to address the declared national emergency,as president george bush did when he prohibited the export of humanitarian supplies to and other terrorist entities following the september,terrorist attacks.see exec.order.
therefore,the district court correctly held that the medical supplies exception to presidential power embodied in the ieepa did not limit the president ability to ban travel to and wit
