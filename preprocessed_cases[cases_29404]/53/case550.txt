the appellant fabil manufacturing company fabil filed this action in the court of international trade to recover the amounts it had paid as duties on imported merchandise which,it alleged,was latently defective and worthless.the court granted the government motion for summary judgment because fabil could not link the defects in the merchandise to particular entries covering the merchandise.we hold that in the circumstances of this case,fabil was not required to make that showing.we therefore reverse the summary judgment and remand.
fabil complaint in the court of international trade alleged that from june to september fabil imported into the united states jackets bearing logos,which fabil had ordered to be machine washable,and paid for them that after importation fabil discovered that the jackets were latently defective at the time of importation because when washed the logos disintegrated and ruined the jackets that,as a result of the defect,purchasers of the jackets returned them to fabil and the jackets were unsaleable and completely worthless.fabil sought an allowance in dutiable value based on the defects.it filed this suit after customs denied its protests challenging customs refusal to grant an allowance in the value of the merchandise imported.
after the government answered,fabil moved for summary judgment.attached to the motion was the affidavit of robert hammer,fabil,who said he had personal knowledge of all facts set forth below.according to the affidavit,in fabil had been authorized by a licensee of the company to manufacture infants and children jackets with the logo.working through a korean manufacturing agent,fabil ordered jackets from two hong kong companies and one korean company.the manufacturing specifications expressly included that the jackets be machine washable,which was critical for two stated reasons.tests of the manufacturing samples submitted to fabil showed that the product was colorfast.based on those test results,fabil ordered the jackets,for which,after importation,it paid the manufacturers by letter of credit the total fob price of.
following importation,fabil discovered that the jackets were not machine washable because the logos were not colorfast and after machine washing the logos disintegrated and their colors ran.when these latent manufacturing defects became visible,the merchandise was returned to fabil.the affidavit listed five department stores that purchased and returned merchandise,which returns established that the subject merchandise was never fit for sale.fabil was forced to dispose of the returned merchandise at a total loss.some was donated to three specified charities and the remainder of the returned merchandise was discarded without compensation.
as a result of its losses resulting from the defective merchandise,fabil was forced into insolvency and out of business.all of the merchandise contained latent manufacturing defects that rendered it unfit for sale and it was completely worthless.
the government did not file any factual material in response to hammer affidavit.instead,it for summary judgment.the court of international trade denied fabil motion,granted the government and entered judgment for the government.fabil united states,d.int l trade.
after quoting the regulation governing the reduction in dutiable value for defective imported goods discussed in part ii,below and stating that a protestant must satisfy the requirements of that provision by clear and convincing evidence,id.at,the court held that there was a disputed issue of material fact whether fabil had ordered defect free merchandise that precluded summary judgment on that question.id.at.the court then held,however,that fabil had failed to establish that the imported merchandise is the same as the merchandise returned and the diminution in value of the imported merchandise.id.at.
it stated that fabil can not establish that the imported merchandise for which it seeks an allowance is the same as the merchandise it claims is defective.specifically,fabil offers no method to tie the allegedly defective merchandise to any entries or group of entries.without this basic proof,the court and customs can not determine whether contested merchandise actually contained a defect at the time of importation,id.at citation omitted,because it offers no evidence to suggest that it could tie the returns to a particular entry or group of entries.id.at.
moreover,fabil can not demonstrate with any precision what the claimed allowance in value should be for the defective merchandise.id.fabil offers no evidence to suggest that any diminution in value due to the claimed defect could be tied to a specific entry or group of entries.again,this is crucial evidence needed to sustain an allowance claim.id.the court also stated that fabil asserts that it donated some merchandise to charitable organizations,yet then claims the merchandise was a total loss.without more,the court can not determine if fabil derived any value from its charitable contributions.for instance,it is unclear whether fabil subsequently took a deduction on its taxes for the contributions.id.
authority to reduce the assessed valuation of defective imported merchandise is provided in,which states 
allowance in value.merchandise which is subject to ad valorem or compound duties and found by the port director to be partially damaged at the time of importation shall be appraised in its condition as imported,with an allowance made in the value to the extent of the damage.
as the court of international trade correctly noted,this regulation provides for an allowance in dutiable value where imported goods are determined to be partially damaged at the time of importation,and the allowance sought is commensurate to the diminution in value caused by the defect.d at.nothing in the regulation,however,states,or even suggests,that to meet those standards the importer always must,in the words of the court of international trade,tie the allegedly defective merchandise to any entries or group of entries,id.at,by submitting detailed records relating to each particular entry and the defects in the imported merchandise the entry covered.
hammer affidavit,which the government did not refute and which we must credit for purposes of summary judgment,mckay united states,evidence must be viewed in party favor,stated that all of the subject merchandise which was identified as the imported jackets was latently defective and worthless at the time of importation.in these circumstances there was no need or occasion to determine which entries contained which defective merchandise.under fabil submission,all the merchandise was defective and all of the entries covered that merchandise.
the court of international trade suggested that because fabil might have taken a tax deduction for its donation of some of the defective goods to charitable organizations,its statement that it suffered a total loss on the merchandise was suspect.d at.if in fact fabil took such a the record does not show whether or not it would affect only the amount of duty that fabil could recover,not whether it was entitled to any recovery at all.
b.in requiring identification of the particular entries that covered the defective merchandise,the court of international trade relied on its decision in samsung electronics america united states,d.int l trade.in this court,the government relies on samsung electronics america united states,in which we affirmed that court of international trade decision.our samsung decision,however,involved quite different facts,and the broad language in the opinion upon which the government relies can not uncritically be extended and applied to the present case.see states power united states.
in samsung,an american company samsung purchased electrical equipment from its korean parent to sell in the united states.the products had various warranties,and the parent agreed to reimburse samsung up to of the total purchase price each year to cover samsung expenses in inspecting,repairing and refurbishing the products with latent defects.during the period covered by the sales contracts between the companies,samsung either sold the d
