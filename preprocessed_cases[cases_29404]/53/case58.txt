the lone cowboy riding his horse on a texas trail is a cinematic icon.not once in memory did the cowboy eat his horse but film is an imperfect mirror for reality.
texas is home to two of the three slaughterhouses in the united states that process horsemeat for human consumption,with the third operating in illinois.after several decades of operations,the texas attorney general informed them that texas is one of a handful of states that prohibits their activities.whether he informed them correctly is the subject of this case.
we vacate the district court permanent injunction barring the prosecution of slaughterhouses for processing,selling and transporting horsemeat for human consumption.we hold that texas agriculture code chapter has not been repealed or preempted by federal law.agric.code ann.vernon chapter.we also find that,as applicable to the parties activities before us,chapter does not violate the dormant commerce clause.
facts and standard of review 
the appellees are three slaughterhouses the slaughterhouses that process and sell horsemeat.while the horse byproducts go to various animal feed,fertilizer and baseball substantial majority of the horsemeat is sold and shipped abroad for human consumption.none of the meat is sold domestically for human consumption.
both beltex and dallas crown operate slaughterhouses in texas.beltex owns a controlling interest in the third appellee slaughterhouse,empacadora de carnes de fresnillo empacadora.empacadora operates in mexico,but sells and transfers its meat to beltex in texas,which then sells it abroad.while empacadora currently operates in mexico,it has speculated that it will one day come into texas to handle distribution,sales,and export matters instead of dealing its product through beltex.the companies have been marketing horsemeat for human consumption as far back as the,but recently the legality of the practice was called into question.
in,texas state representative tony goolsby requested that the texas attorney general clarify the enforceability of chapter,which on its face prohibits the processing,sale or transfer of horsemeat for human consumption.the attorney general issued an opinion stating that chapter was applicable to the slaughterhouses in texas and was not preempted by federal law.
when the slaughterhouses learned of the opinion,and that beltex and dallas crown were facing imminent prosecution,they brought this case.they sought a declaration of legal rights and responsibilities and to enjoin any potential prosecution against them under chapter.they argue that chapter has been repealed,is preempted by federal law,and violates the dormant commerce clause.
the facts of the case are all stipulated,and both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court ruled in favor of the slaughterhouses and permanently enjoined tarrant county district attorney tim curry curry from prosecuting the companies under chapter.the court held that chapter was repealed,was preempted by the federal meat inspection act,and violated the dormant commerce clause.we disagree as to each point.

ii.discussion 
before we can consider potential constitutional infirmities in chapter,we must determine whether it is in force.if it has been repealed then we need not address the constitutional concerns the statute raises.see elkins moreno,d.while it is generally preferable to avoid such constitutional issues,courts can not press statutory construction to the point of disingenuous evasion even to avoid a constitutional question.united states locke,d,quoting moore ice cream rose.
it is unchallenged that chapter prohibits the activities of the slaughterhouses if it is in force.the statute reads 
a person commits an offense if 
the person sells,offers for sale,or exhibits for sale horsemeat as food for human consumption or 
the person possesses horsemeat with the intent to sell the horsemeat as food for human consumption.
agric.code ann.it is also an offense to transfer horsemeat to a person one knows or should know intends to do those prohibited activities.id.at.this statute was first enacted in.laws.while this statute was recently codified as chapter in,the slaughterhouses contend that it was repealed by a provision last codified two years earlier in.
we first find that the texas meat and poultry inspection act tmpia has not implicitly repealed chapter by way of an irreconcilable conflict.see.health safety code ann.section.alternatively,even if the statutes are irreconcilable,chapter,as the one more recently codified,is controlling.
chapter and section are not irreconcilable 
section,titled equine products,states 
a person may not sell,transport,offer for sale or transportation,or receive for transportation,in intrastate commerce,a carcass,part of a carcass,meat,or meat food product of a horse,mule or other equine unless the article is plainly and conspicuously marked or labeled or otherwise identified,as required by rule of the commissioner,to show the kind of animal from which the article was derived.
id.emphases added.the slaughterhouses argue that this implicitly permits the sale of horsemeat for human consumption under certain conditions,and thereby repeals chapter.
implicit repeals are not favored,but if two acts are in irreconcilable conflict the latter controls.jackson stinnett,cir.statutes are in irreconcilable conflict only if there is a positive repugnancy between the statutes,such that one is eviscerated by the other.see.valley auth.hill,d.
the district court agreed with the slaughterhouses that section recognizes the legality of selling horsemeat for human consumption under certain conditions,and thereby repealed chapter prohibition of the activity.it made a special note that section applies to meat food products,which it stressed are defined in the act as capable of use as human food.health safety code ann.the district court read this to mean that,because horsemeat is capable for use as human food,it is implicitly legalized for such a purpose.see order granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment at,summary judgment order.
the district court misreads section.the tmpia is concerned with meat inspection,labeling,packaging,slaughter,transportation,and various other standards of producing meat.it never purports to legalize for human consumption the meat products covered therein.for instance,the act places numerous regulations on livestock,which covers a variety of meats ranging from domestic rabbits to exotic animals.health safety code ann.under the slaughterhouses approach to reading the act,this would implicitly legalize the sale of all exotic animals and domestic rabbits for human consumption,overriding any statute to the contrary.
the better reading is that the tmpia is indifferent as to which meats are legal for public sale,but provides general regulations that may be applied to those that are.just as it did not legalize the sale of all exotic animals for human consumption,it does not legalize the sale of horsemeat by repealing chapter unambiguous language to the contrary.it does not reach the high standard of irreconcilability required for an implicit repeal.
furthermore,that a horse meat food product is capable of use as human food does not mean the product can be legally sold for human consumption.the act explicitly defines capable of use as human food as not naturally inedible by humans.id.at.it does not imply that all edible meats are legal for sale as human food,as evidenced by other provisions in the act that specifically deal with meat food products that are not intended for use as human food.see,id.at b human brains are not naturally inedible by humans,but that does not mean the tmpia authorizes roadside vendors to start selling them.
nobody suggests that horsemeat is naturally inedible by humans,just that chapter makes it illegal to sell for human consumption.section is reconcilable with chapter by reading it as applying only to horsemeat used for other legal purposes,such as animal feed.
chapter prohibits the sale of horsemeat for human consumption.that does not conflict with the regulatory purposes of section or its recognition that horsemeat is not naturally inedible by humans.
fleming foods and codification effect 
even if the statutes are irreconcilable,the latter one controls.stinnett,at.given texas continuing process of codifying its statutes,it is not easy to determine whether section or chapter came later.thankfully that difficult question has already been answered by the texas supreme court in fleming foods of,rylander.we are compelled by that case to find chapter is controlling as the provision last codified.
by way of background,for the past several decades the texas legislative council has been charged with the task of codifying texas statutes.gov t code.this continuing codification process is meant to clarify and simplify statutes,thereby making them more accessible to the public.id.at a.the council power is limited,as it may not alter the sense,meaning,or effect of the statute.id.at b.codifications are therefore often distinguished from substantive enactments.
the statutes at issue here each originated decades ago and each has a rather convoluted history,as the parties discuss at length in their briefs.while chapter was the one last codified,section derived from the latter substantive enactment.if these statutes are irreconcilable,do we look toward the most recent substantive enactment or the one last codified 
in fleming foods,the texas supreme court faced a similar question,asking,what effect should be given to clear,unambiguous statutes that were drafted by the legislative council as part of the codification process but that depart from prior law at.the court emphasized a need for clarity in finding that the codifications enacted by the legislature are the law of this state,and that when specific provisions of a nonsubstantive codification and the code as a whole are direct,unambiguous,and can not be reconciled with prior law,the codification must be given effect.id.at.
fleming foods indicates that if labeled nonsubstantive are legislative enactments that must be given full effect,and such codifications may repeal and prevail over prior laws the complicated and convoluted statutory history raised by the parties here demonstrates how difficult it would be to implement a contrary rule.
at oral argument the slaughterhouses suggested that a case from the texas court of criminal appeals stands for the contrary rule.ex parte holmes.in that case,the earlier statute controlled over a subsequent nonsubstantive codification.but the statute there had an explicit provision indicating that it does not affect the validity of the earlier statute in question.id.at.the court stressed that this was the most important basis for its decision,and that the later codification must be read in light of that language.id.at.chapter contains no similar language indicating that its provisions yield to section,making ex parte holmes inapplicable.
chapter has not been repealed.we now turn our attention to the constitutional concerns the slaughterhouses raise.
preemption 
the first constitutional claim the slaughterhouses raise is that congress,through the federal meat inspection act fmia,has preempted legislation that regulates the sale and transport of horsemeat.if true,the state legislation would be void under the constitution supremacy clause.const.art.vi cl.when addressing preemption claims,our sole task is to ascertain the intent of congress.cal.fed.sav.loan guerra,d.is not to be lightly presumed.id.at.
a piece of federal legislation can expressly preempt states from legislating in a particular area.even if a federal statute does not expressly preempt a piece of legislation,it may do so implicitly by directly conflicting with it or by occupying a field so pervasively as to naturally exclude it.see perry mercedes benz of,cir.we can find no indication that congress intended to prevent states from regulating the types of meat that can be sold for human consumption.we address express and implied preemption in turn.
express preemption 
the fmia contains an express preemption clause,stating that requirements with respect to premises,facilities and operations of any establishment at which inspection is provided which are in addition to,or different than those made under this chapter may not be imposed by any state.it further prohibits states from imposing different m arking,labeling,packaging,or ingredient requirements.id.
this preemption clause expressly limits states in their ability to govern meat inspection and labeling requirements.it in no way limits states in their ability to regulate what types of meat may be sold for human consumption in the first place 
we can not read this as expressly preempting texas prohibition on horsemeat for human consumption.with little explanation,the district court found,preventing slaughterhouses from selling or possessing horsemeat for human consumption is an attempt by texas to regulate the premises,facilities and operations of the slaughterhouses.summary judgment order at.but the fmia preemption clause is more naturally read as being concerned with the methods,standards of quality,and packaging that slaughterhouses use,matters chapter is entirely unconcerned with.chapter does not infringe upon the territory preserved for the federal government by the fmia preemption clause.
the fmia does not expressly dispose states of the ability to define what meats may be available for slaughter and human consumption.we therefore find that chapter has not been expressly preempted.
implied preemption 
even if state legislation is not expressly preempted,it may be implicitly preempted.implicit preemption is usually divided into two types field preemption and conflict preemption.under neither theory did the fmia preempt chapter.
congress did not intend to preempt the entire field of meat commerce under the fmia.field preemption requires a clear congressional intent.guerra,at.it occurs when a federal statute scope indicates that congress intended federal law to occupy a field exclusively.freightliner myrick,d.
the fmia specifically indicates that it did not intend to preempt the field of meat commerce entirely,stating that it shall not preclude any state from making requirements or taking other action,consistent with this chapter,with respect to any other matters regulated under this chapter.furthermore,the fmia contains a narrow inspection and labeling preemption clause,and congress enactment of a provision defining the reach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are not.cipollone liggett group,d.
the act title refers specifically to meat inspection,rather than a more comprehensive scheme of meat regulation.the need for uniform meat packaging,inspection and labeling regulations is strong,lest meat providers be forced to master various separate operating techniques to abide by conflicting state laws.there is no similar need for uniformity with regard to what types of meat states permit to be sold,especially when considering that horsemeat is only produced for human consumption domestically in texas and illinois,and several states have already banned its commercial use for human consumption 
nor does the fmia preempt chapter by conflict.conflict preemption requires that it would be physically impossible for a private party to comply with both federal and state law,or that the law stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.see planned parenthood of houston se.sanchez,cir.
it is certainly not physically impossible to comply with the fmia and chapter.complying with chapter by not selling,possessing,or transferring horsemeat for human consumption would not breach any provision in the fmia.and chapter does not stand as an obstacle to realizing the fmia objectives of assuring that meat and meat food products distributed to consumers are wholesome,not adulterated,and properly marked,labeled and packaged.chapter prohibits a certain type of meat from ever getting to consumers
