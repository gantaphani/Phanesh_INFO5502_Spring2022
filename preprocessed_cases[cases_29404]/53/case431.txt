the united states appeals a decision of the court of international trade classifying certain folio merchandise imported by avenues in leather,avenues under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus.aves.in leather united states,wl.int l trade,cit opinion.because we conclude that the court of international trade correctly classified the imported goods,we affirm.
background 
the merchandise at issue are presentation imported by avenues in.these measure approximately inches tall by inches wide by inches deep when closed,are zippered on three sides with an interior sleeve,possess one exterior open flat pocket and a number of small interior pockets,have a padded carrying handle fitted to the exterior spine,are constructed of paperboard covered with plastic foam and a exterior and interior,contain a calculator,and have an interior metal binder permanently affixed to the spine.
upon importation,the bureau of customs and border protection and its predecessor united states customs service customs classified the merchandise under htsus subheading which covers trunks,suitcases,vanity cases,attach√© cases,briefcases,school satchels,and similar containers w ith outer surface of plastics.avenues argued,however,that the presentation should be classified under either htsus subheading which covers b inders other than book covers,folders and file covers or htsus subheading,which covers m emorandum pads,letter pads and similar articles.
the difference between these two classifications is significant items classified under subheading are dutiable at ad valorem,while items under subheadings and are dutiable at and,respectively.
this is not the first time the parties have disputed the proper tariff classification of this type of merchandise.a brief description of the procedural history of this case is warranted to provide the context for the court of international trade decision,which is the subject of this appeal.
in,upon importation of four other types of leather folios similar to the merchandise at issue in this case,customs classified the leather folios under htsus subheading.aves.in leather united states,d.int l trade.avenues protested customs classification and filed suit in the court of international trade,arguing that the folios should be classified under subheading.id.the court of international trade granted summary judgment upholding customs classification.id.at.avenues appealed to this court,and we affirmed the judgment of the court of international trade.aves.in leather,united states,avenues i.
in,customs classified the goods,which are the subject of this appeal,under subheading.avenues disagreed with customs classification and filed a complaint in the court of international trade,contending that the merchandise is properly classifiable under subheading.the court of international trade granted summary judgment affirming the classification based on the reasoning that,to avoid summary judgment,avenues had to prove that our decision in avenues i was clearly erroneous.id.we reversed the grant of summary judgment and remanded the case because this was a new entry and a court had not previously classified the.aves.in leather united states,avenues ii.
on remand,a trial was held on october,at the court of international trade.to prove that the should be classified under htsus heading,avenues presented testimony of otniel shor,caron ann williamson,and sam goldstein.customs responded by presenting the testimony of customs national import specialists carl abramowitz and kevin gorman to support its contention that the merchandise should be classified under heading.the court of international trade rejected customs classification of the presentation under subheading,and held that they were classified properly under subheading as memorandum pads.cit opinion.
at the trial,avenues witness,shor,the designer of,testified that the article was designed as an organizational aid for taking notes by allowing the user to organize and interact with the matter bound by the pad folio.he further testified that the inside sleeve was designed to hold a standard office folder,and the folio had a maximum inside capacity of inch.thus,avenues contended,the folios at issue were akin to portfolios,or flat cases designed and intended to hold papers.
customs submitted several dictionary definitions of briefcase to argue that the merchandise was prima facie classifiable in heading as either a form of briefcase or as a similar container under an ejusdem generis analysis.emphasizing the container aspects of the merchandise,customs introduced evidence on the marketing of the goods as business travel goods.customs further argued that the folios were capable of being used to carry personal and business objects.
in reaching its conclusion,the court of international trade recognized that the essential characteristics of the listed exemplars in heading are to organize,store,protect,and carry various items.based on the testimony of the witnesses and the evidence presented,it concluded that the had a different specific primary facilitate the taking of notes as well as aid the organization of print and other visual flat materials capable of being bound by the article metal binder or fit within its pockets.relying on general rules of interpretation gri b,the court of international trade concluded that the article had the essential character of a binder or a memorandum pad under heading,and such features complemented the article predominant purpose as an article of stationery,of paper or paperboard.thus,the court of international trade classified the folios as memorandum pads,under subheading.

discussion 
standard of review 
whether an imported item has been properly classified involves a two step analysis ascertaining the proper meaning of specific terms in the tariff provision and determining whether the merchandise at issue comes within the description of such terms as properly construed.sports graphics,united states.determining the proper meaning of terms is a question of law that we review de novo,while determining whether the item fits within such meaning is a question of fact that we review for clear error.id.
on appeal,the appellant bears the burden of establishing reversible error in the decision of the court of international trade,by showing that the court erred in its interpretation of the law,or that its findings of fact are clearly erroneous with due consideration to the appropriate level of deference.park smith,united states.
stare decisis 
customs first argues that the court of international trade decision violates the doctrine of stare decisis because it failed to distinguish this court ruling in avenues specifically,customs contends that because the are substantially the same as the articles at issue in avenues i,the court of international trade should have been bound by the decision in that case,which classified the articles under section and rejected avenues attempt to classify them under section.customs further contends that the court of international trade erred by not providing any basis for distinguishing this case from avenues 
avenues responds that the similarity of the articles does not preclude it from retrying the classification under the rule of law pronounced in united states stone downer.avenues contends that it was allowed to present new or additional evidence to the trial court and have the second case considered on its own merits.avenues finally responds that,contrary to the government assertions,the public will not be left without any guidance due to the apparent conflict between this decision and avenues i because the remaining cases will be resolved on a case by case basis either at the administrative or the judicial level.
it is well settled that collateral estoppel does not prevent an importer from successive litigation over the classification of merchandise,even when the subsequent importations involve the same issue of fact and the same question of law.stone downer,at.however,as we explained in avenues ii,a lthough an importer is free to challenge anew a previous classification of merchandise under the rule of stone downer,we have decided that the importer is burdened by the doctrine of stare decisis.avenues ii,at.
stare decisis in essence makes each judgment a statement of the law,or precedent,binding in future cases before the same court or another court owing obedience to its decision it deals only with law,as the facts of each case must be determined by the evidence adduced at trial mendenhall cedarapids,quoting james moore,moore federal practice,ed.
because the doctrine of stare decisis applies to only legal issues and not issues of fact,avenues is burdened by the previous legal determination that the common characteristic or unifying purpose of the goods in heading consist s of organizing,storing,protecting,and carrying various items.avenues ii,at.more importantly,because the determination of whether the merchandise at issue comes within the description of a tariff provision is an issue of fact,park smith,at,the classification of goods in avenues i is not stare decisis to the classification of the in this case.thus,the court of international trade did not violate the doctrine of stare decisis in classifying the merchandise under heading.
ii.htsus classification 
the parties remaining arguments are directed to the issue of whether the scope of htsus heading or htsus heading encompasses avenues imported folios.we address classification under each of these headings separately.
regarding classification under heading,customs argues that because the articles at issue satisfy the common definition of one of the eo nomine exemplars,briefcases,the court of international trade erred in concluding that the are not classified under section.customs further argues that,under a ejusdem generis analysis,the articles in question are classifiable under heading because they possess the characteristics uniting all of the containers of that heading.
avenues responds that the court of international trade correctly concluded that the are not a form of a briefcase,and properly rejected an ejusdem generis classification under heading in view of its finding that the specific primary purpose of the is to facilitate taking of notes as well as to aid the organization of print and other visual flat materials.
while the court of international trade did not specifically state that the folios in question were not a form of briefcase,the court described the goods in question as pad folios,and,as such,concluded that they lack ed specific eo nomine classification in the htsus.cit opinion at,wl.thus,the court implicitly rejected their classification as a form of a briefcase.based on its observation that the folio pockets were essentially flat,the court found the article suitable only for holding loose papers,files and other flat items such as business cards,floppy discs,et cetera.id.at,wl.the court also acknowledged the testimony of avenues witness,shor,stating that 
shor explained that pad folios are not briefcases,which are designed to carry various as well as personal articles,nor are they attache cases,which are rectangular cases he described them as covers and carriers designed to hold and organize paper products and flats such as cards,envelopes,photographs,file folders,thin catalogues,et cetera,capable of being fit within the pad folio pockets and sleeves.
the trial court also found that while the article could be used to carry personal objects that would normally be carried in a briefcase,the article was not designed to do so.see id.at,wl.the trial court made these factual findings based on the testimony of the witnesses and other evidence presented to the court.we do not discern clear error in either the trial court findings,or its conclusion based on those findings that the are not,eo nomine,a form of briefcase.
heading contains a list of particular items followed by a general phrase,similar articles.it is well settled that when a list of items is followed by a general word or phrase,the rule of ejusdem generis is used to determine the scope of the general word or phrase.see totes,united states.in classification cases,ejusdem generis requires that,for any imported merchandise to fall within the scope of the general term or phrase,the merchandise must possess the same essential characteristics or purposes that unite the listed exemplars preceding the general term or phrase.sports graphics,at.however,a classification under the ejusdem generis principle is inappropriate when an imported article has a specific and primary purpose that is inconsistent with that of the listed exemplars in a particular heading.avenues i,at.
we have previously held that the the common characteristic or unifying purpose of the goods in heading consist s of organizing,storing,protecting,and carrying various items.avenues ii,at.the court of international trade found the specific and primary purpose of the is to facilitate taking of notes as well as to aid the organization of print and other visual flat materials capable of being bound by the article metal binder or fit within its pockets.cit opinion at,wl.customs does not challenge this finding.it asserts,however,that this specific and primary purpose of the can not preclude ejusdem generis classification of the articles under heading.
in avenues i,we concurred with the court of international trade conclusion that the physical characteristics of the leather folios speak strongly to the organizing,storing,protecting,and carrying characteristics of the imported merchandise.avenues i,at.however,the classification of the leather folios in avenues i was resolved on summary judgment.in contrast,in this case,the trial court reached its conclusions after assessing the credibility of the witnesses.specifically,finding shor testimony credible,the court found that the were not designed to accommodate various personal objects.cit opinion at,wl.the court also noted that,in view of the limited storage space of the folio,the article interior is not sufficiently large or durable enough to hold books,thick newspapers or other personal items for any extended period without damaging itself or them.id,wl.while acknowledging that customs presented evidence to show that the articles could be used to carry personal items,the court found the testimony of the product designer of its intended use to be more persuasive.id.at,wl.for the foregoing reasons,we see no basis to conclude that the trial court findings are clearly erroneous,particularly in view of the deference afforded to its factual findings based on credibility of witnesses.see anderson bessemer city,d when findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses,rule a demands even greater deference to the trial court findings for only the trial judge can be aware of the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so heavily on the listener understanding of and belief in what is said.
based on these factual findings,the court of international trade concluded that t he articles features do not impart the essential characteristics of a container.cit opinion at.we agree.here,while the may be used to organize and protect small flat items in addition to a writing pad,they have an internal capacity of only inch and lack significant carrying space.these characteristics make them unsuitable to carry newspapers,books,and other objects that are normally carried in containers that are common to heading.moreover,while the articles in question may be generally described as containers,their specific use is limited to facilitation in taking of notes as well as aiding in the organization of print and other visual flat materials.such a specific use,which predominates over the more general description of containers,precludes classification of the under heading.see totes,at stating that the merchandise in sports graphics was not ejusdem generis with the listed exemplars because the imports had a different purpose and the specific use of the imported merchandise was predominant over the more general description of the listed exemplars.
accordingly,the court of international trade correctly concluded that the are neither classifiable,eo nomin
