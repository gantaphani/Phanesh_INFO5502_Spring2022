in,the department of commerce issued a final determination in an antidumping investigation of certain steel nails from the united arab emirates uae finding that precision fasteners,llc had engaged in targeted dumping and imposed a duty.in calculating precision dumping margin,commerce declined to apply a regulation limiting the use of the methodology to sales because the agency asserted that the regulation had been withdrawn in.see f.
the court of international trade trade court held that commerce had violated the administrative procedure act apa by withdrawing the regulation without providing notice and opportunity for comment.on remand,commerce redetermined precision duty by applying the withdrawn regulation and found that no duty was owing.the trade court affirmed.we hold that commerce violated the requirements of the apa in withdrawing the regulation,leaving the regulation in force that its violation of the apa was not harmless and that the agency did not err in applying the regulation on remand.we therefore affirm the final judgment of the trade court.
background 
in,appellant mid continent nail filed a petition with commerce alleging that imports of certain steel nails from the uae were being sold in the united states at less than fair value,and that such imports were materially injuring,or threatening material injury to,an industry in the united states.certain steel nails from the united arab emirates initiation of antidumping duty investigation,fed.reg.commerce initiated an antidumping investigation during which it determined that appellee precision was among the mandatory respondents,an importer whose dumping rate would be individually determined in the course of the investigation see certain steel nails from the united arab emirates preliminary determination,fed.reg.in,commerce issued an antidumping duty order imposing a percent duty on precision.see certain steel nails from the united arab emirates final determination,fed.reg,certain steel nails from the united arab emirates amended final determination,fed.reg,may.
commerce found that precision had engaged in targeted dumping because precision sales reflected a pattern of export prices that differ ed significantly among certain customers,regions,and time periods.fed.reg.at see also d b i steel united states,fed.cir.and,central to this appeal,the agency proceeded to calculate precision dumping margin by applying the methodology to all sales reported by precision,irrespective of whether the agency had deemed a sale to be targeted or not.see fed.reg.at.
the methodology is one of the three methods that commerce may use in an investigation to calculate dumping margins in accordance with the tariff act of,as amended by the uruguay round agreements act uraa,pub,stat.the statute provides that,in general,commerce shall determine whether subject merchandise is being sold in the united states at less than fair value by either comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the weighted average of the export prices and constructed export prices for comparable merchandise or comparing the normal values of individual transactions to the export prices or constructed export prices of individual transactions for comparable merchandise.d a i ii.these two methods are respectively known as the and methodologies.
the statute permits commerce to use a third method the methodology if certain conditions are met.the methodology compar es the weighted average of the normal values to the export prices or constructed export prices of individual transactions for comparable merchandise.id.d b.to calculate dumping margins using the methodology,however,commerce must find a pattern of export prices or constructed export prices for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among purchasers,regions,or periods of time,targeted dumping and explain why such differences can not be taken into account using the first two methods.id.d b i ii.in other words,commerce must first conclude that a respondent is engaged in targeted dumping and explain why the other two statutory methodologies fail to sufficiently account for it.see steel,at.
in calculating dumping margins using the methodology,commerce has historically used a practice known as zeroing in which negative dumping margins,margins of sales of merchandise sold at nondumped prices are given a value of zero and only positive dumping margins,margins for sales of merchandise sold at dumped prices are aggregated.union steel united states,fed.cir.as a result,dumping margins for sales below normal value are not offset by negative dumping margins for those sales made above normal value.corus staal bv united states,fed.cir.this lack of offsetting leads to higher dumping margins when the methodology is used,which has made calculation of margins using this methodology controversial.see union steel,at.
shortly after the enactment of the uraa,commerce promulgated a regulation through rulemaking restricting the agency use of the methodology.this regulation known as the limiting regulation provided that even in cases meeting the statutory criteria for applying the methodology,the agency would normally limit its application to those sales that constitute targeted dumping,as opposed to applying the methodology to all of a respondent sales.see f see also antidumping duties countervailing duties,final rule,fed.reg,may.
in,however,commerce withdrew the limiting regulation,along with several other regulations governing the agency handling of targeted dumping allegations.see withdrawal of the regulatory provisions governing targeted dumping in antidumping duty investigations,interim final rule,fed.reg,hereinafter withdrawal notice.the agency stated that it had originally promulgated the regulations without the benefit of any experience on the issue of targeted dumping,and that the regulations may have established thresholds or other criteria that prevented the use of the methodology to unmask dumping,contrary to the c ongressional intent.id.commerce noted that withdrawal would allow the agency to gain additional experience with targeted dumping through adjudication.id.
commerce acknowledged in withdrawal notice that repeal of the targeted dumping regulations was subject to the requirement to provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment,pursuant to b b,but expressly waive d the requirement by invoking the apa good cause exception to rulemaking.fed.reg.at.
in finding good cause,commerce explained that rulemaking was impracticable and contrary to the public interest because the rescinded regulations were applicable to ongoing antidumping investigations and that immediate revocation was necessary to ensure the proper and efficient operation of the antidumping law s.id.at no point in withdrawal notice did commerce refer to any prior notices proposing to withdraw the limiting regulation,or otherwise suggest that the agency had provided adequate notice and opportunity for comment under the apa.
in calculating precision dumping margin three years later in this proceeding,commerce applied the methodology,having found both a pattern of export prices that differ ed significantly among customers,regions,or by,and that applying the methodology mask ed differences in the patterns of prices between the targeted and groups.fed.reg.at.in this appeal,no party has challenged commerce determination that the statutory criteria for applying the methodology were met.what the parties dispute is the agency decision to apply the methodology not just to those sales that constitute d targeted dumping,as the limiting regulation had previously provided,but to all sales reported by precision.see id.emphasis added.
precision challenged commerce final determination in the trade court.see mid continent nail united states mid continent i,supp.int l trade.in relevant part,precision argued that commerce was required to apply the limiting regulation to calculate precision dumping margin because the agency repeal of the regulation in withdrawal notice was ineffective and contrary to law,as it had occurred outside the basic procedural framework required by congress under the apa.id.at.according to precision,had the agency applied the limiting regulation,application of the methodology to all of precision domestic sales would not have been justif ied because the agency had only found evidence of targeting for less than one percent of precision sales,the exact scenario that had concerned commerce when it adopted the limiting regulation in the first place.id.at 
the trade court agreed that commerce withdrawal of the limiting regulation violated the apa.after concluding that withdrawal of the regulation was subject to rulemaking,the court rejected the argument that the agency had provided adequate notice and opportunity for comment through two earlier federal register notices because those notices had not proposed to repeal the regulation.see id.at.the court also rejected commerce invocation of good cause and found that the agency procedural default was not excusable as harmless error.see id.accordingly,the trade court remanded commerce final determination and instructed the agency to redetermine precision dumping margin by applying the limiting regulation.id.at.
on remand,commerce applied the limiting regulation as ordered by the trade court.as the regulation provided that commerce would normally not apply the methodology to all sales,see f,the agency concluded that application of the methodology to all of precision sales was unwarranted because the record does not contain evidence to suggest that this normal limitation should not be applied.as a consequence of limiting the methodology to only targeted sales,commerce found that precision dumping margin was de minimis,and therefore imposed a duty of percent.id.
mid continent appealed commerce remand redetermination to the trade court,arguing that the agency had misapplied the limiting regulation.see mid continent nail united states mid continent ii,supp.int l trade.the court rejected mid continent argument and affirmed commerce remand redetermination.see id.at.mid continent then filed this appeal,which commerce has not joined.we have jurisdiction under a.
during the pendency of the trade court proceedings,and in light of the court ruling that withdrawal notice was ineffective to repeal the limiting regulation commerce in initiated a new proceeding to accomplish the repeal.the agency published a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm in which it sought comments on a proposal not to apply the previously withdrawn regulatory provisions governing targeted dumping.of previously withdrawn regulatory provisions governing targeted dumping in antidumping duty investigations,proposed rule,fed.reg.in,commerce issued a final rule making withdrawal of the regulations effective may.see fed.reg.no party to this appeal has challenged the withdrawal,or contended that it should be applied retroactively.accordingly,this case solely addresses whether the withdrawn regulations were in effect during the period between december,and may.

we do not defer to an agency interpretation of the apa statutory requirements,although the statute itself presumes that review of agency action under the standard is highly deferential.org.of veterans advocates,sec y of veterans affairs,fed cir.see also collins transp.safety,cir.for generic statutes like the apa,the broadly sprawling applicability undermines any basis for deference,and courts must therefore review interpretative questions de novo.mobil oil dep t of energy,temp.emer.app.we are free to make an independent determination of the legal question as to whether the agency has made a showing of good cause.
we first address mid continent contention that commerce provided adequate notice for the repeal of the limiting regulation through two federal register notices issued in and targeted dumping in antidumping investigations request for comment,fed.reg,hereinafter request for comment and proposed methodology for identifying and analyzing targeted dumping in antidumping investigations request for comment,fed.reg.may,hereinafter proposed methodology.
the requirement that an agency provide adequate notice before altering its regulations is rooted in the apa provisions governing the administrative rulemaking process.under the apa,whenever an agency decides to formulat e,amend,or repeal a rule,it must first publish an nprm setting forth either the terms or substance of the proposed rule,or a description of the subjects and issues involved.b.for the purposes of notice and comment,withdrawal or repeal of an existing regulation is treated the same as promulgation of a new regulation.see tunik mspb,fed.cir.although the notice need not specify every precise proposal which the agency may ultimately adopt,it must be sufficient to fairly apprise interested parties of the issues involved.nuvio fcc,cir.quoting action for children television fcc,cir.adequate notice is crucial to ensure that agency regulations are tested via exposure to diverse public comment,to ensure fairness to affected parties,and to give affected parties an opportunity to develop evidence in the record to support their objections to the rule and thereby enhance the quality of judicial review.int l union,united mine workers of am.mine safety health,cir.quoting int l union,united mine workers of am.mine safety health.cir.
the dispositive question in assessing the adequacy of notice under the apa is whether an agency final rule is a logical outgrowth of an earlier request for comment.long island care at home,coke,veteran justice,llc sec y of veterans affairs,fed.cir.
the logical outgrowth doctrine recognizes that a certain degree of change between an nprm and a final rule is inherent to the apa scheme of rulemaking through notice and comment.see int l harvester ruckelshaus,cir.accordingly,judicial formulations of the doctrine have sought to balance the values served by adequate notice,see int l union,at,with the public interest in expedition and finality.small refiner lead task force epa,cir.we recently stated,for instance,that a final rule is a logical outgrowth of a proposed rule only if interested parties should have anticipated that the change was possible,and thus reasonably should have filed their comments on the subject during the period.veteran justice,at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted 
courts have consistently upheld final rules as logical outgrowths where the nprm expressly asked for comments on a particular issue or otherwise made clear that the agency was contemplating a particular change.csx transp.surface transp,cir.citing owner operator indep.drivers ass fed.motor carrier safety,cir.and city of portland epa,cir.see also,alto dairy veneman,cir.upholding final rule prohibiting paper pooling of milk producers with distant supply plants because agency notice raised the issue of pool eligibility public service commission fcc,cir.final rule was logical outgrowth because board affiliated with the agency asked for comments on the proposal that was finally adopted,even though the agency itself did not.
courts applying the logical outgrowth doctrine have also permitted agencies to drop critical elements of proposed rules even if a resulting final rule effectively abandons an agency initial proposal.in long island care,for example,the department of labor proposed a rule that would have rendered certain companionship workers outside the exemption to wage and hour restrictions under the fair labor standards act flsa.see at.the rule the agency eventually adopted,however,left these workers within the flsa exemption.the court sustained the agency final rule,observing that s ince the proposed rule was simply a proposal,its presence meant that the department was considering the matter after that consideration the department might choose to adopt the proposal or to withdraw it.id.at.because this result was reasonably foreseeable,the court held that the agency had complied with rulemaking.id 
nonetheless,there are limits to how far a notice of proposed rulemaking may be stretched under the logical outgrowth doctrine.in some cases,these limits may be difficult to discern,kooritzky reich,cir,but certain clear lines have been drawn.the logical outgrowth doctrine does not extend to a final rule that finds no roots in the agency proposal because something is not a logical outgrowth of nothing,or where interested parties would have had to divine the agency unspoken thoughts,because the final rule was surprisingly distant from the a gency proposal.envtl.integrity project epa,cir.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
having summarized the principles animating the logical outgrowth doctrine,we turn to whether commerce repeal of the limiting regulation in withdrawal notice was a logical outgrowth of request for comment and proposed methodology.the trade court determined that the notices were insufficient because neither notice made obvious to an interested observer that rule making to withdraw the rule was intended by the agency.mid continent i,supp.at.we agree.
we begin with the statute.the tariff act as amended by the uraa obligates commerce to make two findings before the agency may use the methodology to assess targeted dumping in an investigation.first,the agency must find a pattern of export prices or constructed export prices for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among purchasers,regions,or periods of time.d b i.second,commerce must explain why such differences can not be taken into account using the other two statutory methods.id.d b ii.
once these criteria are met,however,the statute leaves undefined the precise scope of commerce application of the methodology this led to concerns that if a respondent had been found to be engaged in targeted dumping,but only in some limited fashion,application of the methodology to all of the respondent sales would be unreasonable and unduly punitive.see antidumping duties countervailing duties,fed.reg.commerce responded to these concerns by promulgating the limiting regulation,which provided that the agency would normally limit the application of the method ology to those sales that constitute targeted dumping.f.thus,even if the agency had found a respondent to have engaged in targeted dumping a condition precedent to the agency use of the methodology under the limiting regulation,commerce would normally limit the scope of the methodology to the respondent targeted sales instead of all sales.
ten years after promulgating the limiting regulation,commerce published request for comment,in which the agency sought guidance regarding an appropriate test to determine the existence of targeted dumping.in this notice,commerce admitted that it had accrued only limited experience with targeted dumping despite the intervening years that it had yet to develop a standard targeted dumping test and that its experience with regard to the use of the method ha d been very limited.fed.reg.at.by publishing request for comment,commerce hoped to solicit the public views on its development of a methodology for determining whether targeted dumping is occurring in antidumping investigations,and input on standards and tests that may be appropriate in a targeted dumping analysis.id.specifically,the agency sought guidance on how to determine the existence of a pattern of export prices among purchasers,regions,or periods of time how to determine if such a pattern differ s significantly and the appropriate statistical techniques to assess targeted dumping.id.
despite raising these concerns,request for comment was not published in the federal register as an nprm,meaning that the notice on its face did not indicate that commerce was considering a rulemaking.more problematically,request for comment did not propose any kind of rule or raise any question about the scope of the methodology,much less the conditions under which the agency should depart from its normal practice of not applying the methodology to all sales.request for comment did not even include a citation to the limiting regulation.instead,in request for comment,commerce simply sought information on the broad issue of how the agency should determine the existence of targeted dumping a distinct,predicate issue to the problem addressed by the limiting regulation,the scope of the methodology.
the consequence of these deficiencies is that request for comment falls short of satisfying the apa requirements for notice and opportunity for comment.we find the circuit decision in kooritzky to be instructive on this point.at issue in kooritzky was a rule promulgated by the department of labor that prohibited employers from substituting one alien for another with respect to certifications necessary for obtaining visas.see at.in a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement statutory amendments,the agency made no mention of substitution.id.at.in rejecting the agency nprm as inadequate,the circuit observed that the notice contain ed nothing,not the merest hint,to suggest that the agency might tighten its existing practice of allowing substitution,and that the preamble to the agency notice in the federal register offered no clues to a nonexpert reader of what was to come.id.
like the notice at issue in kooritzky,request for comment gave no indication that commerce was contemplating a potential change in the limiting regulation.nor did commentators responding to request for comment perceive the agency to be raising the issue of the regulation repeal or revision,or suggest such repeal or revision themselves we therefore have no doubt that commerce repeal of the limiting regulation was not a logical outgrowth of request for comment because,as in kooritzky,s omething is not a logical outgrowth of nothing.at.
six months after request for comment,commerce still concerned with the appropriate test for determining the existence of targeted dumping proposed a new test addressing the problem in proposed methodology this second notice acknowledged the responses that commerce had received following request for comment,but did not offer the agency response thereto.see proposed methodology,fed.reg.at.in addition to seeking new comments on its proposed test for determining the existence of targeted dumping,commerce also raised several related issues.id.in particular,the agency request ed comment on the application of the methodology and the conditions,if any,under which the methodology should apply to all sales to the target,even if some sales of a control number do not pass the targeted dumping test.id.at emphasis added.
proposed methodology thus presents a closer question under the logical outgrowth doctrine than request for comment.the limiting regulation had provided that commerce would normally apply the methodology only to those sales found to constitute targeted dumping.f.therefore,by seeking public comment on the conditions,if any,under which the methodology should be applied to all sales made by a respondent instead of just the respondent targeted sales commerce effectively raised the general subject of the limiting regulation,perhaps suggesting wholesale elimination of the agency discretion to apply the methodology to all sales.
although courts have found logical outgrowths when an nprm expressly asked for comments on a particular issue or otherwise made clear that the agency was contemplating a particular change,csx,at,we do not think that this principle supports holding proposed methodology to have provided the necessary predicate for withdrawal notice.kooritzky,at.for starters,like request for comment,proposed methodology on its face did not indicate that further action to withdraw the limiting regulation was being considered.instead,proposed methodology merely sought public views on how to interpret the regulation itself which provided that the agency would normally not apply the methodology to all sales that is,how exactly commerce should apply the normally limitation.because the agency had left the circumstances in which it would have applied the methodology to all sales largely undefined,interested persons would have perceived the question regarding the limiting regulation posed in proposed methodology as simply commerce first step in clarifying the scope of its own regulation.indeed,comments that the agency received in response to proposed methodology did not understand commerce to be raising a broader question,whether to repeal the limiting regulation.see note,infra.
posing such a general scope question does not suffice to provide the requisite fair notice for an agency rule to be upheld as a logical outgrowth.see long island care,at.in csx,the circuit confronted a similar problem in addressing a rule promulgated by the surface transportation board stb to resolve railroad rate disputes.the stb had originally proposed a rule allowing such disputes to be resolved using comparison groups drawn from the most recent year of waybill sampling.at.in the rule finally adopted,however,the agency switch ed from one year to four years worth of data.id.the stb argued that the final rule was a logical outgrowth because mention ing the release of data gave notice that the amount of data available might change.id.at.
the circuit rejected this argument for two reasons.first,the court observed that although the stb notice had proposed a number of related regulatory changes,it nowhere even hinted that the agency might consider expanding the number of years from which comparison groups could be derived.id.second,permitting the mere mention of the timeframe for drawing comparison groups to provide adequate notice would allow the agency to justify any final rule it might be able to devise by whimsically picking and choosing within the four corners of a lengthy notice.id.quoting envtl.integrity project,at.such a rule would hardly promote the purposes of the apa notice requirement.id.
the same reasoning applies to proposed methodology.despite mentioning the subject matter of the limiting regulation,commerce primary purpose in the proposed methodology was to propose a new test for determining whether a respondent was engaged in targeted dumping and to seek public comment on this proposal.as a related issue the agency posed a general question of when to apply the methodology to all sales,not just targeted sales.but this question did not raise the particular issue of withdrawing the limiting regulation it sought only to clarify the meaning of the limiting regulation recitation of the word normally.and,as in csx,allowing commerce question in proposed methodology to provide adequate notice for withdrawal notice would permit the agency to adopt a final rule from a limitless continuum of regulatory actions.given this range of possibilities,we can not say that commerce repeal of the limiting regulation was reasonably foreseeable.long island care,at.it follows that neither request for comment nor proposed methodology provided adequate notice and opportunity for comment necessary for compliance with the apa.
mid continent argues that even if commerce did not itself provide the required notice,comments made in response to request for comment and proposed methodology urged commerce to apply the methodology to all sales and thereby effectively raised the issue of repealing the limiting regulation.
although responses by commentators may be relevant to the court inquiry under the logical outgrowth doctrine,as a general matter,an agency can not bootstrap notice from a comment.fertilizer inst.epa,cir.here,the comments relied on by mid continent never urged commerce to repeal the limiting regulation commentators simply asked the agency to construe the regulation more or less broadly many of these comments simply urged commerce to follow the approach the agency had set forth when it first promulgated the regulation in,that in some instances,it may be necessary to apply the methodology to all sales to the targeted area,or even to all sales of a particular respondent,fed.reg.at noting that such cases could encompass respondents engaged in widespread or extensive targeted dumping.see note,supra.and,the fact that comments responding to request for comment and proposed methodology were entirely silent on the issue of repealing the limiting regulation supports the conclusion that these notices were insufficient to render the agency actions in withdrawal notice a logical outgrowth.see,council tree commc ns,fcc,cir.
finally,our conclusion that withdrawal notice is not a logical outgrowth of either request for comment or proposed methodology is further bolstered by four other considerations.first,commerce never referred to request for comment or proposed methodology in withdrawal notice,nor responded to the comments it had received in response to the two earlier notices second,in withdrawal notice the agency did not adopt any of the proposals made by commentators,choosing instead to resolve the scope of the methodology through adjudication.fed.reg.at.third,commerce curiously requested further comments regarding its repeal of the limiting regulation in withdrawal notice,which suggests that the agency believed itself to not have secured adequate comments on the issue.in contrast,commerce did not make a similar request for additional comments in its rulemaking to withdraw the limiting regulation.see fed.reg.at.last but not least,commerce did not suggest in withdrawal notice that it had in fact complied with the apa by issuing the earlier notices.to the contrary,commerce thought it necessary to invoke the apa good cause exception,which implies that the agency did not consider its prior notices to have satisfied the statute procedural requirements.although the inconsistency of simultaneously invoking good cause and arguing post hoc compliance with the apa is not dispositive,the tension between these conflicting positions strongly supports our view that commerce and now,mid continent assertion that the agency had complied with rulemaking is not supportable.
in summary,we hold that commerce repeal of the limiting regulation in withdrawal notice was not a logical outgrowth of request for comment and proposed methodology,and that agency failed to provide adequate notice under the apa.
we must now consider whether commerce failure to provide adequate notice may be excused for good cause,the sole ground commerce cited for dispensing with notice and comment in withdrawal notice.an agency may forgo rulemaking for good cause if it finds and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable,unnecessary,or contrary to the public interest.b b.
as a general matter,exceptions to rulemaking under the apa are narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced.mobil oil,at quoting new jersey epa,cir.in mobil oil,we stated that an invocation of good cause requires an agency to show that delaying the rule at issue would create a significant threat of serious damage to important public interests as the exception would otherwise become an all purpose to the apa rulemaking provisions.id.at.such significant threat s encompassed situations where the announcement of a proposed rule itself would precipitate activity by affected parties that would harm the public welfare,for example,price controls subject to predatory regulatory arbitrage or other market dislocations.id.citing nader sawhill,temp.emer.app.other courts have emphasized the need to find similarly serious threats in order to invoke the good cause exception.see,mack trucks,epa,cir.citing possible imminent hazard to aircraft,persons,and property and rules of importance necessary to stave off any imminent threat to the environment or safety or national security haw.helicopter operators ass faa,cir.citing a recent escalation of fatal air tour accidents.
the requirement that an agency incorporate the finding and a brief statement of reasons for good cause in the rules issued means that we are limited to examining the reasons commerce cited in withdrawal notice to justify its invocation of good cause.see mobil oil dep t of energy,temp.emer.app.see also growers ass n,united farm workers,cir.commerce cited two of the three available statutory grounds for invoking the good cause exception.first,the agency stated that notice and comment were impracticable because the limiting regulation was applicable to ongoing dumping investigations,and immediate revocation was necessary to ensure the proper and efficient operation of the antidumping law and to provide the relief intended by congress.fed.reg.at.mid continent relatedly asserts that dumping investigations are subject to statutory deadlines that can not be extended at the agency discretion.see b a,c,a.
notice and comment on a rule may be found to be impracticable when the due and required execution of the agency functions would be unavoidably prevented by its undertaking public rulemaking proceedings.growers,at quoting nutritional foods ass kennedy,cir.critically,we along with several other courts have held that statutory deadlines in and of themselves do not generally provide a basis for invoking good cause on the ground of impracticability.see,shell oil fed.emer,temp.emer.app.but see phila.citizens in action schweiker.cir.upholding good cause where congress gave the agency only days to promulgate regulations implementing a complex scheme of federally funded state benefits.a contrary rule would encourage administrative gamesmanship because an agency unwilling to provide notice or an opportunity to comment could simply wait until the eve of a statutory,judicial,or administrative deadline,then raise up the good cause banner and promulgate rules without following apa procedures.council of mountains,donovan,cir.in fact,the temporal exigency implied by withdrawal notice appears more theoretical than actual as mid continent observes,commerce did not have occasion to apply the limiting regulation withdrawal until eight months after withdrawal notice,and did not issue a final determination relying on the withdrawal until fifteen months later thus,the fact that commerce would have had to apply the limiting regulation to ongoing investigations can not constitute a basis for good cause excusing its failure to go through notice and comment.
second,commerce invoked the good cause exception on the ground that notice was contrary to the public interest because the agency application of the limiting regulation may have prevented the use of the methodology to unmask dumping.fed.reg.at.this argument,however,is again foreclosed by precedent because an assertion of mere pocketbook or harm to regulated entities is generally not sufficient to establish good cause as nearly every agency rule imposes some kind of economic cost see mack trucks,at contrasting such economic harms with a situation in which an entire industry and its customers are imperiled.as the trade court observed,the denial of regulatory relief in this case is not the sort of pressing urgency of a type that does not always exist in the trade context.mid continent i,supp.at citing gold east paper jiangsu united states,supp.int l trade.thus,commerce did not show a public interest consideration sufficient to support the agency invocation of good cause.
on appeal,mid continent offers a new justification for good cause that commerce did not adopt in withdrawal notice.citing commerce statement that the effect of the agency targeted dumping regulations was to deny relief to domestic industries,and that this effect was inconsistent with the agency statutory mandate to provide such relief,fed.reg.at,mid continent argues that commerce had determined the withdrawal was necessary because the existing regulations were contrary to law,and thus immediate withdrawal was fully justified.in connection with this argument,mid continent cites the doctrine of deference to agency statutory interpretations under chevron,nat.res.def.council,to assert that the limiting regulation was contrary to statute because it was inconsistent with commerce view of the statute in withdrawal notice.mid continent theory,therefore,is that there was no need for commerce to undergo rulemaking because the limiting regulation was contrary to the statutory provisions of the tariff act.
this theory of good cause did not appear in withdrawal notice and therefore can not support a finding of good cause.see growers,at.in any case,we do not agree with mid continent premise that the agency had determined the limiting regulation to be contrary to law.commerce did not state in withdrawal notice that the limiting regulation was contrary to an unambiguous statutory provision and,to our knowledge,no party has ever challenged the validity of the limiting regulation under the tariff act.what commerce actually stated was that the effect of the regulations was inconsistent with its statutory mandate,which the agency broadly framed as provid ing relief to domestic industries materially injured by unfairly traded imports.fed.reg.at.these statements are not tantamount to a determination that a regulation is contrary to an unambiguous provision of statutory law 
nor do we agree that the inconsistency of a regulation adopted under an agency previous statutory interpretation with the agency present statutory interpretation ipso facto renders the regulation contrary to law.by definition,an agency ability to alter its statutory interpretation requires statutory ambiguity,and,under chevron,an agency can only reject a prior interpretation of an ambiguous statute if it explains why it is doing so.see,cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,smiley citibank south dakota,rust sullivan.in this situation,rulemaking under the apa is more rather than less important to lay the groundwork for the agency exercise of its chevron authority.
thus,we agree with the trade court that commerce invocation of the exception did not support its decision to dispense with rulemaking under the apa.
mid continent argues that even if commerce repeal of the limiting regulation violated the apa,the agency actions may nonetheless be affirmed on the ground of harmless error.the apa directs reviewing courts to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error in deciding whether to hold unlawful and set aside agency action.see.the supreme court has dedescribed this provision as an administrative law harmless error rule.shinseki sanders.we must therefore determine whether commerce failure to comply with rulemaking may be excused as harmless error.
mid continent contends that commerce procedural error was harmless because precision can not show prejudice of a sort cognizable under the statute.relying on our decision in intercargo insurance united states,mid continent argues that p rejudice means injury to an interest that the statute,regulation,or rule in question was designed to protect,and that the only injury precision can show that commerce reached an adverse decision in its dumping investigation is not an interest protected by notice and comment,fed.cir.precision counters that it was required to show only that commerce procedural error had some bearing on the substance of the decision reached,and that given the magnitude of the agency error and its inability to participate in a rulemaking,this standard is satisfied.riverbend farms,madigan,cir.
in determining whether a procedural error committed in the course of rulemaking was harmless under the apa,courts have distinguished between an agency technical failure or substantial compliance with the apa procedural requirements on one hand which may constitute harmless error,and its complete failure to do so on the other which may prevent the error from being harmless.united states reynolds,cir.in the first category,the agency has provided some notification and method for commenting but some technical failure in that process violates statutory requirements.in these technical failure cases,the party challenging the agency rule may be required to demonstrate that,had proper notice been provided,they would have submitted additional,different comments that could have invalidated the rationale of the rule.id.at internal citation omitted quoting city of waukesha epa,cir.
