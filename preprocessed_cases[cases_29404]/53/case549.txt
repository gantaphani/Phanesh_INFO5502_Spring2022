discussion 
we review the court of international trade grant of summary judgment for correctness as a matter of law,deciding de novo whether genuine issues of material fact existed and whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.carl zeiss,united states.in reviewing a denial of a motion for summary judgment,we give considerable deference to the trial court,and will not disturb the trial court denial of summary judgment unless we find that the court has indeed abused its discretion.elekta instrument scientific int l.when both parties move for summary judgment,the court must evaluate each motion on its own merits,resolving all reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration.mckay united states.
determining the meaning of a tariff term in the htsus is an issue of statutory interpretation and thus a question of law.nissho iwai am.united states.if an htsus provision is ambiguous and customs issues a regulation that fills a gap or defines a term in a way that is reasonable in light of the legislature revealed design,customs interpretation is entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d.united states haggar apparel,d.however,in the absence of such a regulation,this court has held that chevron deference does not extend to customs interpretation in an ordinary classification ruling.mead united states,cert.granted,d determining whether a particular imported item falls within the scope of the various classifications,as properly construed,is a question of fact.carl zeiss,at.in this case,because the structure and use of the imported camcorders are not in dispute,and customs has not promulgated any regulations interpreting the tariff terms at issue,our analysis of whether the imported merchandise has been properly classified turns on the determination of the proper meaning and scope of the relevant tariff classifications.id.
jvc argues that the court of international trade erred in concluding that customs properly classified the subject merchandise under subheading.jvc argues that camcorders are not classifiable under heading because they do not fall within the common meaning of the term television cameras.jvc asserts that a camcorder is by definition a combined television camera and videocassette recorder.jvc further asserts that because camcorders have two and independent functions,a camcorder is more than a television camera,and therefore is not classifiable as one.jvc also argues that this court previous determination of the common meaning of the term television camera in sears is controlling because the relevant tariff terms under the tsus and htsus are identical.finally,jvc argues that,because camcorders are not prima facie classifiable under heading and are instead described under its proposed alternative headings,they should be classified under either subheading or.
the government responds that the court of international trade correctly affirmed customs classification of jvc camcorders under subheading.the government asserts that camcorders fall within the common meaning of television cameras,and that as an eo nomine provision,heading includes all forms of television cameras.the government also contends that the explanatory notes to heading provide additional support for the classification of camcorders under that heading.the government further asserts that sears is not dispositive in this case,as that decision involved the interpretation of a tariff term under the tsus,not the htsus.the government further contends that the more than doctrine does not apply to cases arising under the htsus,and has been subsumed into the general rules of interpretation gris.finally,the government asserts that,while camcorders may be described by subheadings and,they should not be classified under these subheadings because heading is more specific.
applied in numerical order,the gris of the htsus and the additional united states rules of interpretation govern the proper classification of merchandise entering the united states.carl zeiss,at.according to gri,classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relevant section or chapter notes.thus,a court first construes the language of the heading,and any section or chapter notes in question,to determine whether the product at issue is classifiable under the heading.baxter healthcare of united states,quoting orlando food united states.absent contrary legislative intent,htsus terms are to be construed according to their common and commercial meaning.carl zeiss,at.a court may rely upon its own understanding of the terms used,lexicographic and scientific authorities,dictionaries,and other reliable information.id.
under gri a,when goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings,the court should determine which heading is the most specific,comparing only the language of the headings and not the language of the subheadings.orlando food,at.onl
