this is an interlocutory appeal of a question certified by the united states district court for the southern district of new york jones,under b,calling for interpretation of the jurisdictional provisions of the edge act.in a suit brought in a new york state court,which was removed by defendants to federal court under a,plaintiffs appeal from the district court order denying their motion for remand to the state courts.whether the district court denial of remand was proper turns on whether the dispute falls within,which deems certain civil suits involving offshore banking operations to arise under the laws of the united states,so that the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction.the district court ruled that the case falls within jurisdictional grant.the court accordingly denied the plaintiffs motion for remand,but wisely certified the question for interlocutory appeal so as to avoid the risk of conducting an extensive trial which might be mooted by a higher court subsequent determination that remand to the state court was required.in fact,we conclude that the dispute does not fall within grant of jurisdiction so that removal from state to federal court was not authorized by the statute.we therefore vacate the district court order denying remand 
plaintiffs are american international group,aig and its various subsidiaries,which invested in residential securities rmbss that were underwritten,sponsored,or sold by defendants.defendants are bank of america corporation boa and subsidiaries,including merrill lynch,and countrywide financial corporation.the complaint alleges that defendants engaged in various fraudulent misrepresentations while underwriting or sponsoring rmbss,in which plaintiffs invested approximately billion,eventually suffering large losses when the rmbss fell into default.
rmbss are securities comprised of the rights to cash flows from multiple residential mortgages.they are generally created by placing multiple mortgages secured by residential real property into a trust.the trust issues securities in the form of mortgage certificates which entitle the holders of those securities to the payments received by the trust on account of its mortgage holdings.the trust collects the principal and interest payments made by borrowers under the mortgages,and pays those amounts out to the holders of the rmbss in accordance with the terms established for division of the trust revenues and assets see in re lehman.sec,cir.
a tiny percentage of the mortgages aggregated by defendants into several of the trusts which issued the rmbss that plaintiffs purchased were secured by real property in the united states territories,including puerto rico,guam,the virgin islands,and the northern mariana islands.
discussion 
as this appeal turns on a pure question of law,our review is de novo.bah mukasey,cir.
relying on the fact that some of the mortgages aggregated into the trusts that issued the rmbss in which plaintiffs invested were secured by properties in the united states territories,defendants contend that this dispute comes within the terms of,with the consequence that defendants were expressly authorized by to remove the state court action to federal court,and that the district court correctly denied plaintiffs motion for remand to state court plaintiffs respond that the facts do not come within the scope of.
a.the edge act.
the edge act was enacted in for the purpose of supporting foreign trade,in part by authorizing the establishment of international banking and financial corporations.those corporations would be chartered and supervised by the federal reserve board,and freed from regulation by state and local banking authorities so that they could compete more effectively with foreign banks in offshore banking operations.the act prefatory statement of purpose asserts 
congress declares that it is the purpose of this subchapter to provide for the establishment of international banking and financial corporations operating under federal supervision with powers sufficiently broad to enable them to compete effectively with similar institutions in the united states and abroad 
to achieve these goals,the act authorized the creation of banking corporations chartered by the federal reserve bank,edge act banks or edge act corporations,which could engage in offshore banking operations freed from regulatory barriers imposed by state banking commissioners that hindered other banks in efforts to compete with foreign banks.
section,providing for federal court jurisdiction of certain suits to which these edge act banks were parties,was added fourteen years later,in as part of the glass steagall act.the apparent purpose of was to give edge act banks predictable uniformity of adjudication supervised in the federal courts,and thus better protection against potentially divergent and conflicting strictures imposed by banking authorities of states.
the circuit explained 
looking back to the edge act itself,however,one can divine the likely reasons for the grant by of federal jurisdiction that would follow years later.crafted in the wake of the turmoil that the world war had caused in international financial markets,the edge act called forth a new type of federally controlled institution intended to increase the stability of,and the public confidence in,international markets federal supervision of these financial institutions was seen as essential if they were ever to succeed in the international marketplace.thus a governor of the federal reserve board would tell the senate committee on banking and currency that the time will probably come when the conflict of the dual control exercised by the federal reserve board and by the banking department of a state may be a matter of embarrassment or operate to restrict the activities of the banking corporation,and the benefits and protection of a federal charter would be of great value in competing for business in foreign countries.we infer,therefore,that the substantive federal regulations that the congress placed upon edge act corporations,to be supplemented by the oversight of the federal reserve board,are intended to facilitate and stimulate international trade by providing the uniformity of federal law.

b.the text of in relation to this dispute.
section reads,in relevant part,as follows 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity to which any corporation organized under the laws of the united states shall be a party,arising out of transactions involving international or foreign banking,or banking in a dependency or insular possession of the united states,or out of other international or foreign financial operations,either directly or through the agency,ownership,or control of branches or local institutions in dependencies or insular possessions of the united states or in foreign countries,shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the united states,and the district courts of the united states shall have original jurisdiction of all such suits and any defendant in any such suit may,at any time before the trial thereof,remove such suits from a state court into the district court of the united states for the proper district 
the statute is somewhat confusingly drafted and perhaps ambiguous.what is clear is the following.in order to qualify for removal to federal court 
the suit must be a civil suit at common law or in equity.
a corporation organized under the laws of the united states,an edge act corporation must be a party to the suit.
the suit must aris e out of one of three described types of offshore transactions or operations transactions involving international or foreign banking,or banking in a dependency or insular possession of the united states,or out of other international or foreign financial operations.in the balance of this opinion,for brevity and convenience we use the term offshore banking transaction to refer to the types of transactions specified in this clause of.
what is less clear is whether the offshore banking transaction out of which the suit must arise must be a transaction of the edge act corporation that must be a party to the suit,or whether any offshore banking transaction suffices,regardless of whether that corporation was involved in it.this is the issue on which the appeal turns.
in our view,plaintiffs argument based on the text of the statute is persuasive.their argument depends on the statute inclusion of the phrase,either directly or through the agency,ownership,or control of branches or local institutions in dependencies or insular possessions of the united states or in foreign countries.this clause,which makes good sense if understood as plaintiffs contend,would be a superfluous,meaningless appendage if the necessary offshore banking transaction did not need to be that of the corporation organized under the laws of the united states,which must be party to the suit.
the words either directly or through the agency,ownership,or control of branches or local institutions in dependencies or insular possessions of the united states or in foreign countries necessarily refer to an actor taking some action.the only actor named in the statute to which they could apply is the corporation organized under the laws of the united states,which must be a party,and the only action named is the necessary offshore banking transaction.the statute thus means that civil suits may be brought in,or removed to the federal courts if 
a ny corporation organized under the laws of the united states shall be a party,and the suit aris es out of transactions involving international or foreign banking,or banking in a dependency or insular possession of the united states,or out of international or foreign financial operations,which it has conducted either directly or through the agency,ownership,or control of branches or local institutions in dependencies or insular possessions of the united states or in foreign countries.
the either directly or through the agency clause thus serves the purpose of clarifying that grant of federal jurisdiction applies not only when the federally chartered corporation itself engaged in the offshore banking transaction,but also when that transaction was done by the corporation foreign or territorial agency,branch,or subsidiary.
section,understood in this manner,makes perfect sense when viewed in terms of the edge act objectives.as noted above,the edge act was designed to authorize the creation of federally chartered banks which could compete more effectively in offshore banking operations than banks burdened by regulations.the provision for federal court jurisdiction was designed to assure such banks of access to federal courts to better ensure their freedom from restrictions that might be imposed by state regulators.as the activity sought to be encouraged and facilitated by the act is the engagement by edge act banks in offshore banking transactions,it makes perfect sense that the ambiguous statute assuring them access to federal courts be understood to give that access in suits relating to the activities the act seeks to promote,to wit,the banks engagement in offshore banking transactions.
defendants,in their effort to support removal jurisdiction,argue for an interpretation of which not only violates grammatical rules,but also would result in an arbitrary and illogical meaning.citing a principle of construction which favors reading a limiting clause or phrase as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows,barnhart thomas,d,defendants argue that the phrase either directly or through the agency,ownership,or control of branches or local institutions in dependencies or insular possessions of the united states or in foreign countries should be read to modify only the immediately preceding clause,arising out of other international or foreign financial operations,and not as modifying the other preceding clauses specifying suits that arise out of transactions involving international or foreign banking,or banking in a dependency or insular possession of the united states.we can see no merit,grammatical or otherwise,to the argument.
we address first the grammar.the quotation from barnhart on which defendants rely does not fully state the principle of construction.the barnhart opinion,immediately following the sentence quoted by the defendants,cites and quotes from the sutherland treatise on statutory construction.see singer,sutherland on statutory construction,ed.the statement in the treatise,on which the supreme court relied,is more qualified and nuanced than the statement the defendants quote from the text of the barnhart opinion.the treatise says,referential and qualifying words and phrases,where no contrary intention appears,refer solely to the last antecedent.see barnhart at.emphasis added.
one of the methods by which a writer indicates whether a modifier that follows a list of nouns or phrases is intended to modify the entire list,or only the immediate antecedent,is by punctuation specifically by whether the list is separated from the subsequent modifier by a comma.when there is no comma,as in the statute considered in barnhart,the subsequent modifier is ordinarily understood to apply only to its last antecedent.when a comma is included,as in the edge act provision,the modifier is generally understood to apply to the entire series.see,sir ernest gowers,fowler modern english usage ed.explaining that in the sentence french,german,italian,and spanish,in particular are taught,the insertion of the comma at the end of the list show s that in particular relates to all four languages and not to spanish only see also kahn lucas lancaster,lark int l,cir when a modifier is set off from a series of antecedents by a comma,the modifier should be read to apply to each of those antecedents,abrogated on other grounds by sarhank grp.oracle,cir.for example,the statement,this basketball team has a center,a huge power forward,and two large guards,who do spectacular dunks,differs from the statement,this basketball team has a center,a huge power forward,and two large guards who do spectacular dunks.the first statement conveys that all four players do spectacular dunks.the latter statement conveys that only the guards do so.
the list of offshore transactions in is separated from the subsequent modifier by a comma,indicating,according to the conventions of grammar and statutory interpretation,an intention that the modifier apply to the entire list and not merely to the last item in the list.it lists three types of transactions out of which the suit must arise to qualify those involving international or foreign banking those involving banking in a dependency or insular possession of the united states and those arising out of other international or foreign financial operations.at the end of that list is a comma,and then a modifier,which establishes that the statute provisions apply regardless of whether a qualifying transaction was done directly or through the agency,ownership,or control of branches if there were no comma separating the last phrase in the list from the subsequent modifier,defendants argument would at least be consistent with the barnhart principle.the comma,however,distinguishes the barnhart principle and indicates a contrary intention.
nor is this a case in which the statute grammar is in conflict with the apparent intentions of congress.here it makes perfect sense for the modifier to apply to all three preceding phrases,and it would make little sense for it to apply only to the last of the three.according to defendants interpretation,allows litigation to which an edge act corporation is a party to be brought into federal court if the suit arises out of international and foreign financial operations that are something other than international or foreign banking,regardless of whether the corporation acted by itself or through the agency,ownership or control of a branch.but if the suit arises out of international or foreign banking,or banking in a dependency or insular possession of the united states,the statute would provide access to federal courts only if the edge act corporation conducted the transaction itself,and not if it acted through the agency,ownership or control of a branch.defendants d
