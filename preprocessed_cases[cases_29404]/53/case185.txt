background 
legal framework 
the antidumping statute provides for the assessment of remedial duties on foreign merchandise sold,or likely to be sold,in the united states at less than its fair value.at the conclusion of an investigation,if commerce and the united states international trade commission have made the requisite findings,commerce publishes an order that directs customs officers to assess duties on imports of goods covered by the investigation.id.a.
each year after the order is published,commerce provides interested parties with an opportunity to request an administrative review of the order.if commerce receives a request,it conducts a review of the order.id.a.each review constitutes a separate segment within the same administrative proceeding.see b.
for each review,the statute requires commerce to determine the individual weighted average dumping margin for each known exporter and producer of the subject merchandise.c.a dumping margin reflects the amount by which the normal value the price a producer charges in its home market exceeds the export price the price of the product in the united states or constructed export price.steel united states,citing a footnote omitted.
although commerce has authority to place documents in the administrative record that it deems relevant,the burden of creating an adequate record lies with interested parties and not with commerce.qvd food united states,internal quotation marks,brackets,and citations omitted.the placement of the burden on interested parties stems from the fact that the international trade administration,the relevant agency within commerce,has no subpoena power.see rhone poulenc,united states.accordingly,each interested party that appears before commerce must cooperate to the best of its ability with commerce requests for information,b,which means that each party must do the maximum it is able to do,nippon steel united states.while the standard does not require perfection and recognizes that mistakes sometimes occur,it does not condone inattentiveness,carelessness,or inadequate record keeping.id.
if a respondent withholds requested information,fails to provide such information in the form or manner requested,or provides information that can not be verified,the statute requires commerce to use whatever facts are available to make its determination.u.a.if commerce finds that a respondent has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information,the statute permits the agency to draw adverse inferences commonly known as adverse facts available when selecting from among the available facts.id.b.commerce may employ such inferences to ensure that the party does not obtain a more favorable result by failing to cooperate than if it had cooperated fully.statement of administrative action accompanying the uruguay round agreements act saa,vol,at,reprinted in,in selecting from among the adverse facts available,commerce may rely upon information derived from the petition filed to initiate the investigation a final determination in the investigation a previous administrative review or any other information placed on the record.b.once it selects particular facts,commerce uses them to assign a dumping margin for each respondent that it reviews.
if commerce relies on secondary information rather than on information obtained in the course of the review,the statute requires that the agency shall,to the extent practicable,corroborate that information from independent sources that are reasonably at its disposal.id.c.secondary information is information derived from the petition that gave rise to the investigation,the final determination from the investigation,or any previous review concerning the subject merchandise.saa at,at.secondary information does not include information obtained from the subject segment,which is known as primary information.see c see also gallant ocean thai.united states.
ii.administrative proceedings 
in july,commerce published in the federal register notice of the antidumping duty order covering the subject merchandise.see polyethylene terephthalate film,sheet,and strip pet film from taiwan.dep t of commerce july,antidumping duty order,as corrected.dep t of commerce july.upon timely submitted requests,commerce initiated the subject administrative review in august.see initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews and deferral of initiation of administrative review,dep t of commerce,initiation of review.the review covered three respondents,including nan ya and shinkong materials technology corporation shinkong see id.in december,without providing a reason,nan ya informed commerce that it would not participate in the review.it subsequently submitted no information to commerce.
commerce issued the preliminary results of the review in august.see polyethlene terephthalate film,sheet,and strip from taiwan.dep t of commerce,preliminary results of review.because commerce determined that nan ya failed to act to the best of its ability when it withheld information,and that it significantly impeded the proceeding,it applied an adverse inference to nan ya in selecting among the facts available.id.at.in selecting among the adverse facts available,commerce assigned a rate to nan ya,which represented a rate that commerce calculated for nan ya in the review.id.
in the final results,although commerce continued to find it appropriate to apply adverse facts available to nan ya,it lowered the rate that it assigned to nan ya.commerce determined that data from the current period of review can form the basis for nan ya adverse facts available rate in this review.footnote omitted.it relied upon the highest margin of that it calculated for the other mandatory respondent in the review shinkong.commerce reviewed the underlying transaction that forms the basis of the rate and found it because it falls within a range of margins and it was otherwise not unusual.footnote omitted.commerce also observed that the data from the most recent review in which nan ya participated show that commerce calculated numerous margins for nan ya far above,meaning that the rate reflects prices at which nan ya could have sold the subject merchandise.commerce made these findings but did not corroborate shinkong information pursuant to c,finding the corroboration requirement inapplicable because shinkong data reflected primary,rather than secondary,information.nan ya subsequently appealed to the cit.
iii.cit proceedings 
in february,the cit remanded to commerce so that the agency could address various arguments that nan ya raised for the first time in the litigation.nan ya i,d at.the cit noted that nan ya rate changed between the preliminary and final results,such that nan ya first opportunity to challenge the revised margin arose in the litigation.id.at.it also directed commerce to further explain whether the corroboration requirement under c applied to shinkong information obtained during the subject review in light of this court opinion in de cecco di filippo fara martino united states,id.at.
on remand,commerce rejected nan ya arguments and continued to apply the adverse facts available rate.commerce determined that,under the second step in chevron,natural resources defense council,a permissible construction of any other information placed on the record in b permits it to use the highest margin from the subject review.it also found that it need not corroborate shinkong information and that c corroboration requirement did not apply because the information that it used as adverse facts available came from the record of the subject review,rather than from a separate segment of the proceeding.it also found that de cecco highlights the distinction requiring corroboration of only secondary information.n.
the cit subsequently sustained commerce remand redetermination.nan ya ii,d at.as to the corroboration requirement of c,the cit observed that commerce makes a fairly airtight argument under a straightforward chevron step one interpretation that focuses on the plain meaning of the corroboration requirement as set forth in c.id.at.nevertheless,it observed that in the final results and in its remand redetermination commerce did not simply select shinkong highest transaction specific margin in setting nan ya rate,and leave it at that.commerce went further and measured the rate appropriateness by analyzing nan ya own prior data.id.citations omitted.because commerce followed its standard corroboration playbook to tie the selected adverse facts available rate to nan ya,the cit held that the corroboration requirement of c and de cecco reasonableness requirement appl y after all.id.at citations omitted.
although the cit regarded nan ya arguments as hav ing some merit,it held that they do not render commerce use of the rate unreasonable because other competing record information suggests that the rate was not aberrational.id.at.it held that substantial evidence supported commerce selection of the rate,including the fact that the transaction underlying that rate involved a larger quantity than many of shinkong other sales and differed from other models in the least important physical characteristics.id.citation omitted.it also considered significant the fact that shinkong did not ask commerce to exclude the transaction as aberrational.id.finally,the cit found that nan ya applied its arguments only to shinkong information,leav ing unchallenged commerce corroborative justification for the reasonableness of the rate nan ya was capable of dumping at as evidenced by nan ya own data from the review.id.at citation omitted.
nan ya appeals the cit final judgment.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
standard of review 
the court applies the same standard of review as the cit,upholding commerce determinations that are supported by substantial evidence on the record and otherwise in accordance with law.b b i.although we review the decisions of the cit de novo,we give great weight to the informed opinion of the cit and it is nearly always the starting point of our analysis.ningbo dafa chem.fiber united states,internal quotation marks,brackets,and citations omitted.
the court reviews de novo whether commerce interpretation of the statute is in accordance with law,doing so within the framework established in chevron.under the first step,we must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if congress intent is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.under the second step of chevron,if an agency statutory interpretation promulgated under the authority delegated to it by congress is reasonable it is binding o n the courts unless procedurally defective,arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to the statute.ningbo dafa chem.fiber,at quoting wheatland tube united states,second alteration in original see also united states eurodif,commerce interpretation governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory language to the contrary or unreasonable resolution of language that is ambiguous.
ii.commerce determination accords with law 
nan ya does not contest commerce decision to apply adverse facts available in determining its dumping margin,but principally argues that commerce applied the incorrect legal standard in determining the margin.appellant br.the adverse facts available rate here is contrary to law.appellant reply br.our argument is as to legal standards that commerce must use for a lawful adverse facts available rate.emphasis modified.specifically,nan ya contends that commerce violated b and c when it assigned the rate to nan ya.see appellant br.as discussed below,commerce determination does not conflict with law.
nan ya misunderstands commerce duties under the statutory scheme 
as an initial matter,nan ya bases a number of its allegations on the legal premise that commerce must select an adverse facts available rate that reflects commercial reality and is accurate.appellant br,discussing commercial reality id.at,discussing accurate.nan ya arguments borrow these terms from past decisions of this court.the cit similarly has relied upon these terms in recent decisions,not only in cases involving adverse facts available determinations but also in other areas.see,baoding mantong fine chemistry united states,wl,at.int l trade,discussing commercial reality in adverse facts available context dongguan sunrise furniture united states,wl,at.int l trade,same see also vinh hoan united states,d.int l trade discussing the term accurate in the selection of a surrogate country and surrogate values under c,albemarle united states,d.int l trade discussing commercial reality in the selection of the rate assigned to examined respondents in nonmarket economy antidumping proceedings.our jurisprudence to date has not straightforwardly defined these terms today,we clarify their meaning.
in the early,we began to use the terms commercial reality and accurate in our trade remedy decisions in a variety of contexts.for example,we held that commerce,consistent with the statute in effect at the time,may rely upon a rebuttable presumption that the highest margin calculated in a prior segment of the proceeding reflects a respondent pricing behavior during a later period,rhone poulenc,at using accurately to sustain commerce interpretation of the predecessor to b that commerce must consider a accounting principle in imputing costs and may support its decision by relying upon a respondent records kept in the ordinary course of business,lmi la metalli industriale,united states,favorably quoting commerce use of accurate in calculating a respondent warehousing costs and discussing commercial reality in the context of time value of money that commerce can not assume absolute consistency in prices,but may compare foreign and domestic goods based on shared physical characteristics,united states,discussing commercial reality in the context of consistency of prices and accurate when describing commerce decision to match products with similar physical characteristics and that commerce must account for a particular company sales practice when interpreting a contract,samsung elecs,united states,using commercial reality and accurate to discuss contract terms.we also used the term accurate in maintaining that,when commerce uses secondary information as adverse facts available,that secondary information must reflect an estimate constructed pursuant to the statutory method for calculating dumping margins to meet the corroboration requirement under c.de cecco,at.and we used the terms while observing that a respondent dumping margin may change if the respondent changes its pricing behavior.see parkdale int l united states,using commercial realit y and accurate to describe the attendant changes in a dumping margin following a respondent change in pricing behavior.
since,we began to use the terms with greater frequency.for example,in reviewing a commerce adverse facts available determination made during the first administrative review of an order,we said that the petition rate commerce selected did not represent commercial reality within the industry in light of the dumping margins calculated at the end of the investigation for cooperative respondents.gallant ocean,at see also id.favorably quoting the use of accurate in de cecco.we have repeated that statement when reviewing the same kind of commerce determination in other appeals.see,ad hoc shrimp,at quoting commerce use of commercial reality and favorably quoting the use of accurate in de cecco dongtai peak honey indus.united states,using commercial reality to describe a margin that commerce calculated using another respondent verified information and that commerce applied as adverse facts available in a later segment and holding that accuracy concerns can not overcome ability to enforce its procedural deadlines kyd,united states,favorably quoting use of commercial reality in gallant ocean.we also have stated that the rate commerce assigns to a examined respondent in a nonmarket economy antidumping proceeding should reflect that respondent commercial reality.see bestpak gifts crafts united states,see also id.favorably quoting use of accurate in rhone poulenc and gallant ocean changzhou wujin fine chem.factory united states,favorably quoting use of accurately and accurate in parkdale and gallant ocean,respectively id.at reyna,dissenting explaining that an adverse facts available rate need not reflect a examined respondent commercial reality.
we clarify that commercial reality and accurate represent reliable guideposts for commerce determinations.those terms must be considered against what the antidumping statutory scheme demands.see chevron,at holding that agencies and the courts must follow congress unambiguous directive or the agencies otherwise must provide a permissible construction of an ambiguous statute.the term commercial reality does not appear in the statutes that commerce administers,et.seq,and the term accurate appears only once,id.b explaining that a party that provides factual information to commerce shall certify that such information is accurate and complete to the best of that person knowledge congress has provided specific methods for commerce to employ when it executes its duties,such as in calculating normal value or export price,export price,normal value,or when the agency assigns rates on the basis of adverse facts available,b.when congress directs the agency to measure pricing behavior and otherwise execute its duties in a particular manner,commerce need not examine the economic or commercial reality of the parties specifically,or of the industry more generally,in some broader sense.see eurodif,at explaining that public law is not constrained by private fiction when congress has entrusted commerce to take particular action.the statute,or permissible interpretation of it,provides the backdrop against which we must review the agency determination.chevron,at.
our case law and the statute thus teach that a commerce determination is accurate if it is correct as a mathematical and factual matter,thus supported by substantial evidence and reflects commercial reality if it is consistent with the method provided in the statute,thus in accordance with law.see essar steel united states,sustaining a commerce determination as accurate because it was supported by substantial evidence and determined in accordance with the statutory requirements citation omitted kyd,at discussing same see also gallant ocean,at explaining that a rate did not reflect commercial reality because of concerns that the numbers used in the underlying calculations later proved not to be credible,meaning that commerce had not used a lawful method to assign a dumping margin under b citation omitted.our holding reflects what the statutory scheme already requires of commerce to support its determinations.b b i explaining that commerce determination will be sustained unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.and it reflects the familiar principle that a dministrative decisions should be set aside only for substantial procedural or substantive reasons as mandated by statute,not simply because the court is unhappy with the result reached.yankee nuclear power nat.res.def.council,internal citation omitted.as we have said before about the antidumping law,o ur duty is not to weigh the wisdom of,or to resolve any struggle between,competing views of the public interest,but rather to respect legitimate policy choices made by commerce in interpreting and applying the statute.suramerica de aleaciones laminadas,united states,citation omitted.
the court does not use accurate and commercial reality in some broader sense,such as to require commerce to apply the statutory methods to determine the industrywide commercial realities prevailing during a particular time period.albemarle,d at.nor must commerce prove a negative about a respondent pricing behavior if that respondent fails to provide evidence that would yield more representative calculations of its pricing behavior,see,home meridian int l,united states,for the statute permits commerce to use adverse facts available in that situation to assign the respondent a margin,b see also psc vsmpo avisma united states,explaining that absent constitutional constraints or extremely compelling circumstances,the administrative agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.the statutory scheme measures through specific methods pricing behavior deemed unfair by congress namely,dumping.et.to obligate commerce to account for other market conditions that the statute does not misconceives not only the scope of the agency statutory responsibility,but also the nature of the administrative process.yankee nuclear power,at,and could subject commerce to allegations that it acts ultra vires in future administrative proceedings,see city of arlington fcc,explaining that an agency power to act and how it is to act is authoritatively prescribed by congress,so that when it act s improperly,what it do es is ultra vires.it also would permit courts to reach outcomes not intended by congress.see,viraj grp.united states,a court errs in adopting an interpretation of a statute that would create a tremendous burden on commerce that is not required or suggested by the statute see also jbf rak llc united states,discussing same.indeed,the pursuit of what the court perceives to be the best or correct result would render judicial review totally unpredictable.psc,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
nan ya fails to demonstrate error by commerce 
nan ya alleges that commerce determination does not comport with what b and c demand.appellant br.we discuss each set of arguments in turn.
commerce decision to use shinkong highest transaction specific margin as a total adverse facts available rate is permitted by the plain terms of b 
section b permits commerce to use any other information placed on the record as adverse facts available.u.b.in its remand redetermination,commerce found that language ambiguous because it does not directly address whether the agency may use the highest margin from an ongoing segment as a total adverse facts available rate.nevertheless,commerce found that the statute reasonably could be read to allow such use because it reflects a comparison of a sale price to its home market sale price the quintessential comparison for a dumping margin.finally,it found that the saa supports its interpretation.
we disagree with commerce that the phrase any other information placed on the record in b is ambiguous and,instead,hold that the statute plain terms permit the agency to apply shinkong highest margin as nan ya adverse facts available rate.under the first step of chevron,we must first carefully investigate the matter to determine whether congress purpose and intent on the question at issue is judicially ascertainable,using traditional tools of statutory construction.timex,united states,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.one such canon explains that,in the absence of a statutory definition,we construe statutory term s in accordance with their ordinary or natural meaning.fdic meyer,citation omitted.
the statute does not define the phrase any other information placed on the record.the word any is the key modifier in the phrase in question.any means one that is selected without restriction or limitation of choice.any,webster third new international dictionary of the english language unabridged.the absence of a restriction or limitation means that the statute gives commerce substantial discretion to decide which record information to use and certainly encompasses shinkong single highest margin.that conclusion finds support in the broad reach that the supreme court has given to the word any.see,united states rosenwasser,equating any with all see also barseback kraft ab united states,discussing same.and our conclusion is consistent with what we have said before,albeit not in precise chevron terms.see ta chen stainless steel pipe,united states,i t is within commerce discretion to presume that the highest prior margin reflects the current margins.citation omitted.
our conclusion finds further support in the structure of.as explained below,congress did not require commerce to corroborate information that it uses in the subject review if the agency obtained the information in the course of that segment however,congress required commerce to corroborate information from a prior segment of the proceeding that it uses as adverse facts available in a later segment.b c.that congress decided not to require commerce to corroborate information obtained in this review,such as shinkong,further evinces that commerce has broad discretion to choose among the available record information.see,russello united states,w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.citation omitted.because the statute text answers the question,that is the end of the matter.timex,at citation omitted.
nan ya alleges that commerce unlawfully interpreted any other information placed on the record in b as allowing it to use the highest margin on the record of the review.according to nan ya,commerce interpretation unreasonably incorporates within its ambit a de minimis amount of sales that results in a margin that is many multiples more than all calculated margins,appellant br.capitalization omitted permits the agency to use a margin that is aberrant and otherwise falls outside the continuum of calculated margins in view of various statistical analyses,id.at,relies upon incomplete criteria in light of other statutory and regulatory criteria,id.at relies upon the absence of a request from shinkong to exclude the transaction giving rise to the rate,id.at and creates a per se rule that is inconsistent with agency practice,id.at.
as an initial matter,we observe that nan ya fails to make these arguments within the operative chevron framework.that misstep typically warrants a finding of waiver.see united states great am.ins,it is well established that arguments that are not appropriately developed in a party briefing may be deemed waived.citations omitted carducci regan,finding waiver when counsel has made no attempt to address the issue because t he premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts do not sit as boards of legal inquiry and research,but essentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them see also zhejiang sanhua united states,d.int l trade citing great american insurance and in holding that a party waived its arguments for failing to raise them within the operative chevron framework jbf rak llc united states,d.int l trade citing great american insurance in reaching the same conclusion mtz polyfilms,united states,d.int l trade citing carducci in reaching same conclusion.nevertheless,for clarity,we address nan ya contentions.
nan ya fails to recognize that neither any other information placed on the record in b,nor any other provision in subsection b contains any of the requirements it alleges.section b states 
if commerce finds that an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information from commerce,commerce,in reaching the applicable determination under this subtitle,may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available.such adverse inference may include reliance on information derived from 
the petition,
a final determination in the investigation under this subtitle,
any previous review under section of this title or determination under section of this title,or 
any other information placed on the record.
b.the statute simply does not require commerce to select facts that reflect a certain amount of sales,yield a particular margin,fall within a continuum according to the application of particular statistical methods,or align with standards articulated in other statutes and regulations.congress decided what requirements commerce must fulfill in reaching its determinations,b,and we do not impose conditions not present in or suggested by the statute text.see,jbf,at viraj,at.
nan ya remaining arguments also fail.although nan ya alleges that commerce remand redetermination establishes that commerce may per se use the highest calculated dumping margin as adverse facts available,appellant br,its argument ignores commerce statement in that determination,commerce remand redetermination does not create a per se rule that automatically requires use of the highest margin.explaining that commerce ultimately applied a margin significantly lower than nan ya highest margin from the review that is on the record of this review.commerce articulated that the use of the highest margin will depend upon the facts of a particular case,explaining that,if the highest margins from any segment of the proceeding are insufficient to induce cooperation,then it will use other margins.
finally,nan ya argues that commerce decision to apply adverse facts available impermissibly rest s wholly on deterrence punishment.appellant br.the legislative history belies nan ya argument.the saa explains that 
w here a party has not cooperated,commerce may employ adverse inferences about the missing information to ensure that the party does not obtain a more favorable result by failing to cooperate than if it had cooperated fully.in employing adverse inferences,one factor commerce will consider is the extent to which a party may benefit from its own lack of cooperation.
saa at,at.on remand,commerce explained that,b ecause the highest weighted calculated margin applied in this proceeding is nan ya own previous adverse facts available rate of,a major consideration for commerce was selecting a rate sufficient to induce nan ya to cooperate in the future.see also finding that the rate was calculated for nan ya during the most recently completed administrative review and nan ya still chose to not cooperate emphasis added.thus,commerce consideration of the deterrent effect of its determination reflects the law expectation.
commerce correctly followed the unambiguous terms of the statute and found that the corroboration requirement in c does not apply 
nan ya next argues that commerce determination violates the statutory corroboration requirement because commerce did not corroborate nan ya information from the review that it used to support its selection of the rate.br.capitalization omitted.nan ya argument overlooks the plain language of c.
before we address nan ya argument,we first must determine what c requires.section c states that 
w hen commerce relies on secondary information rather than on information obtained in the course of an investigation or review,commerce shall,to the extent practicable,corroborate that information from independent sources that are reasonably at its disposal.
commerce properly found that c unambiguously does not require the agen
