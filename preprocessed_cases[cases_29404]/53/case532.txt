rocknel fastener,appeals from the decision of the court of international trade upholding the tariff schedule classification by the united states customs service of certain fasteners imported by rocknel.rocknel fastener,united states,d.int l trade.we affirm.
the products at issue in this case consist of a variety of metal fasteners that rocknel imported from japan in.the fasteners,which are fabricated from metal alloys,have bodies and hexagonally shaped heads.their bodies are fully or partially threaded.rocknel has admitted that the fasteners were designed to be installed in holes of assembled parts and that the fasteners were designed to be tightened or released by turning their heads.
the customs service liquidated the fasteners under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus.subsequently,rocknel filed a protest,claiming that the fasteners should have been classified under htsus subheading.
heading of the htsus covers screws,nuts,coach screws,screw hooks,rivets,cotters,cotter pins,washers and similar articles of iron and steel.subheading narrows that category to threaded articles consisting of other screws and bolts.that subheading is further divided into several subheadings,including the two at issue in this case.subheading,which rocknel argues should have been applied to the fasteners in this case,covers bolts.subheading,which customs applied,covers other items having threads with a diameter of six millimeters or more.
after customs denied the protest,rocknel appealed to the court of international trade.the court concluded that the tariff schedule required that the terms bolt and screw be given mutually exclusive definitions.the court further concluded that the definition of the terms bolt and screw found in specification,specifications for identification of bolts and screws,published by the american national standards institute ansi and the american society of mechanical engineers asme the ansi specification accurately reflected both the common and the commercial meaning of those terms.because customs had looked to the ansi specification as the source of the definitions of bolt and screw for tariff classification purposes,and because rocknel had admitted that under the ansi specification the fasteners at issue in this case would be classified as screws and not bolts,the court granted summary judgment to customs upholding the agency classification of the fasteners.this appeal followed.
the meaning of a tariff term,a matter of statutory construction,presents a question of law.bausch lomb,united states.when,as in this case,a tariff term is not defined in either the htsus or its legislative history,the term correct meaning is its common meaning.mita copystar am.united states.the common meaning of a term used in commerce is presumed to be the same as its commercial meaning.simod am.united states.to ascertain the common meaning of a term,a court may consult dictionaries,scientific authorities,and other reliable information sources and lexicographic and other materials.tower sons united states,ccpa simod,at.
the government agrees with the court of international trade that the ansi specification represents the common meaning of the terms bolt and screw.rocknel disputes that the ansi specification embodies the common meaning of the terms and asserts that customs has not satisfied its burden of showing why a meaning should be adopted.see rohm haas united states,one who argues that a term in the tariff laws should not be given its common or dictionary meaning must prove that there is a different commercial meaning in existence which is definite,uniform,and general throughout the trade.
at the outset,we must consider whether,and to what extent,customs classification decision in this case is entitled to deference.the court of international trade,relying on this court decision in mead united states,concluded that no deference was due customs classification.although the court of international trade correctly applied our decision in mead,that decision has been superseded by the supreme court subsequent decision in the mead case.united states mead,d.the supreme court held that when customs has not promulgated a regulation,but has simply issued a classification ruling implicitly interpreting an htsus provision,the ruling is not entitled to chevron deference,see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.nonetheless,the court held that a classification ruling is entitled to some deference in accordance with the principles of skidmore swift.mead,at.at see also.group united states,wl.lexis heartland by products,united states.lexis.as the court explained in skidmore,
the weight accorded to an administrative judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.
at.likewise,mead indicates that when considering the degree of deference to accord a customs classification ruling,a court should consider its writer thoroughness,logic,and expertness,its fit with prior interpretations,and any other sources of weight.at.at.
customs has not issued a regulation regarding construction of the terms bolt and screw in the tariff schedule.however,customs policy of applying the ansi specification has been established in headquarters ruling letters dating back more than years,see headquarters ruling letter june,headquarters ruling letter,and in a customs service publication,distinguishing bolts from screws april.the rulings and the publication contain detailed guidance as to the distinction between bolts and screws,consistent with the ansi specification.because the classification in this case is supported by thorough analysis in customs publications and decisions,and is consistent with prior interpretations of the pertinent provisions of the htsus by customs over a period of years,the supreme court decision in mead indicates that customs decision to interpret the provisions of htsus subheadings and according to the definitions contained in the ansi specification must be accorded some deference by the courts.as the supreme court recognized,the regulatory scheme at issue in this case is highly detailed,and customs can bring the benefit of specialized experience to bear on the subtle questions in this case.mead,at.at.for that reason,while we recognize our independent responsibility to decide the legal issue of the proper tariff classification in this case,we also recognize our responsibility to give some deference to customs interpretation as we do so.
rocknel argues that the court of international trade erred when it assigned the terms bolt and screw mutually exclusive definitions.rocknel asserts that because subheading is an eo nomine classification for bolts,while subheading is a basket category for other products,the correct classification requires only that a particular fastener satisfy the definition of a bolt,regardless of whether it might also be regarded as being a screw.
we agree with the court of international trade that whether or not heading is considered to be a basket category,the structure of the tariff schedule requires that the terms bolt and screw be given mutually exclusive definitions.simply put,because subheading covers bolts and screws,and subheading covers bolts,subheading is necessarily limited to screws.therefore,the proper classification of a particular fastener requires a determination whether the fastener is a bolt or a screw and does not allow for the possibility that the fastener might qualify as either.
the ansi specification that customs adopted as the basis for its distinction between bolts and screws is included in fastener standards ed,which is published by the industrial fasteners institute.the ansi specification begins with two general definitions 
bolt a bolt is an externally threaded fastener designed for insertion through holes in assembled parts,and is normally intended to be tightened or released by torquing a nut.
screw a screw is an externally threaded fastener capable of being inserted into holes in assembled
