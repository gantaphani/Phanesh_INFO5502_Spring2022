ford motor company ford appeals from a final judgment of the court of international trade cit dismissing all of its claims.ford motor united states,d.int l trade ford iii.the cit dismissed some of ford claims as barred by the statute of limitations under i and declined to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief for the remainder of ford claims.
we hold that we need not address the statute of limitations issue because the statute is not jurisdictional.we further hold that the cit did not abuse its discretion in declining to issue declaratory relief.while the cit did not reach the declaratory judgment issue with respect to some of ford claims,we conclude that the cit would have denied all claims on that ground,and that a remand is therefore unnecessary.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
in and,ford imported cars from the united kingdom into the united states.on the cars entry into the united states,ford deposited estimated duty payments with customs and border protection customs.ford later concluded that it overpaid the duty actually owed because its estimates had been too high.ford then filed nine reconciliation entries with customs between june and october,seeking a total refund of about million.
customs may liquidate an entry,which involves a determination of the amount of duty owed,based on any just,impartial,and uniform appraisement prescribed by the secretary of the treasury.customs has one year from the time of filing to liquidate an entry under a.it may extend that period if it needs additional information to properly appraise or classify the imported merchandise or if the importer requests an extension and demonstrates good cause.see b.customs is entitled to a maximum of three extensions.a,d,e.if not extended before the expiration of any period,the entry shall be deemed liquidated at the rate of duty,value,quantity and amount of duties asserted by the importer of record.a.similarly,if customs has not liquidated an entry after the maximum extended period of four years,it is deemed liquidated by operation of law.see b f.when an entry is deemed liquidated,customs forfeits the ability to recalculate the duty owed instead,the duty is calculated based on the importer own asserted rate,value,and quantity.see f.here the rate asserted by the importer is the rate asserted in its reconciliation entries rather than the rate asserted at the time of original entry customs seeks to recalculate the duty owed,urging that the original rate was correct.
on april,ford filed suit in the cit to challenge customs treatment of its nine reconciliation entries,arguing that customs had failed to properly extend the liquidation period in accordance with b and therefore could not recalculate the duty customs contended that it had extended the liquidation periods,which did not expire until between june,and october,four years after entry.at the time ford filed suit,customs had yet to liquidate any of ford nine entries.because there were no liquidation decisions to protest under.a,ford brought its challenge under i.the cit residual jurisdiction provision is available only when jurisdiction under subsections a through h of is not available 
ford sought a declaratory judgment that its entries had deemed liquidated as a matter of law,and,therefore,that it was entitled to a million refund based on its duty calculation asserted in the reconciliation entries.during the pendency of that action,customs liquidated five of the nine entries.the government moved to dismiss ford claims for lack of jurisdiction.the cit granted the government motion as to those entries that had already liquidated,ruling that a,not i,was the proper basis to challenge those entries.ford motor united states,d.int l trade ford i.as to the four entries that remained unliquidated,the cit recognized that i jurisdiction was proper but declined to issue discretionary declaratory relief,explaining that ford would have ample opportunity to assert claims for those entries in a future a action.
shortly after ford i,customs liquidated ford remaining entries,declining to provide ford with any refund.ford protested the merits of all nine of customs liquidations.customs denied the protest for ford entries,and ford commenced a separate court action challenging that denial under a,which is pending as of the time of this appeal.ford motor united states.int l trade.ford protest for its entries is currently held before customs pending the outcome of this appeal.
ford appealed from the cit decision in ford i dismissing its claims for a declaratory judgment that its entries had deemed liquidated as a matter of law at ford asserted rate.see ford ii,at.we reversed the cit dismissal on jurisdictional grounds of those claims relating to the five entries that were liquidated during the pendency of the cit action.id.at.we held that,based on the rule,the government actions in liquidating the entries may have opened up a new avenue for judicial review under a,but the actions can not defeat subject matter jurisdiction under i.id.at.we vacated the cit discretionary dismissal of ford claims that remained unliquidated because the cit analysis extended in significant part from its flawed jurisdictional analysis.id.at.we explained that the cit retains authority,but no obligation,to revisit its declaratory judgment authority on remand.id.
on remand at the cit,the government again moved to dismiss,this time arguing that ford claims directed to its entries were barred by the statute of limitations under i,which governs i actions.the cit again granted the motion to dismiss for all claims directed to the entries except claim,finding that ford action was barred by the limitations period,having been commenced more than two years after ford reasonably should have known about the existence of those claims.ford iii,d at.regarding claim and the claims directed to ford entries as to which there was no statute of limitations issue the cit recognized that i jurisdiction was available but again declined to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction.see id.at.
the cit explained that adjudicating the claims would not be an efficient and effective use of the court time and resources,because ford retains the ability to seek relief for all of its claims in its pending protest and a action.id.the cit further explained that t he a case will allow ford to challenge not only the question of whether the entries in question were deemed liquidated,but the substance of any actual liquidations or reliquidations that occurred,the merits of ford reconciliation claims,an option not available in this declaratory judgment case.id.ford appealed.

discussion 
as to claims and concerning ford entries,we first consider whether the statute of limitations under i is jurisdictional,such that we must address it before considering the merits.see,steel citizens for a better env t.ford argues that our mandate in ford ii precluded the cit from considering the statute of limitations because we reversed the cit dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and the statute of limitations is jurisdictional.the government argues that the cit was powerless to adjudicate ford claims because they fell outside of the cit authority under i,and that the mandate in the original appeal is not a bar even though the statute of limitations is jurisdictional.appellee br.at.we disagree with both parties.section i statute of limitations is not jurisdictional.
section i of title provides that a civil action of which the court of international trade has jurisdiction under section of this title,other than an action specified in subsections a h of this section,is barred unless commenced in accordance with the rules of the court within two years after the cause of action first accrues.
in skf usa,customs and border protection,f d,we assumed without deciding that this statute of limitations was jurisdictional.in recent years,the supreme court has articulated a more stringent test for determining when statutory time limits are jurisdictional.united states kwai fun wong,is the latest in a series of supreme court opinions developing this test the court explained that there is a high bar to establish that a statute of limitations is jurisdictional.in recent years,we have repeatedly held that procedural rules,including time bars,cabin a court power only if congress has clearly stated as much.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.absent such a clear statement,courts should treat a restriction as nonjurisdictional.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.while congress need not incant magic words,it must do something special,beyond setting an deadline,to tag a statute of limitations as jurisdictional.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.this is true even when the time limit is important most are and even when it is framed in mandatory terms again,most are.id.the statutory language,see arbaugh,u.at,placement of the provision within the statutory scheme,henderson,at,and context,including supreme court interpretations of similar provisions in many years past,auburn reg l.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted,are indicative of whether a provision is jurisdictional.
recently in sikorsky aircraft united states,we followed those cases and held that the limitations set forth in a a governing the contract disputes act was not jurisdictional.we explained that the statute,which provides that e ach claim by a contractor against the federal government relating to a contract shall be submitted within years after the accrual of the claim,did not speak in jurisdictional terms,nor did its context suggest that it is jurisdictional.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.because no interpretation by the supreme court counseled to the contrary,we thus held that the statute lacked any special characteristic that would warrant making an exception to the general rule that filing deadlines are not jurisdictional.id.at.
here,i similarly does not speak in jurisdictional terms.id.at quoting auburn reg l.at.while the first clause of i references the cit jurisdiction under section of this title,it does so only to distinguish the reach of i from a h,which covers all actions other than the residual provision of i.the remainder of i,which provides the actual time limitation at issue here,simply provides that i actions are barred unless commenced in accordance with the rules of the court within two years after the cause of action first accrues.i.this does not suggest,much less provide clear evidence,that the provision was meant to carry jurisdictional consequences.henderson,at.like the time limitations addressed in kwai fun wong and sikorsky,i reads like an ordinary,statute of limitations,spelling out a litigant filing obligations without restricting the court authority.kwai fun wong.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.indeed,the text is even clearer here than in kwai fun wong and sikorsky,because the first clause of i provides that jurisdiction has already been established in all cases governed by the limitations provision a civil action of which the court of international trade has jurisdiction under section is barred unless commenced within two years after accrual.i emphasis added.
nor does the placement of i within the statutory scheme provide any indication that the provision is jurisdictional.the court has often explained that separation of a filing deadline from a jurisdictional grant indicates that the time bar is not jurisdictional.kwai fun wong.at.whereas provides the time limitations for civil actions against the united states,a different section of title confers jurisdiction on the cit to hear such actions.see,i the cit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced against the united states,its agencies,or its officers.as in kwai fun wong,n othing conditions the jurisdictional grant on the limitations periods,or otherwise links those separate provisions.at.treating i time bar as jurisdictional would thus disregard the structural divide built into the statute.id.
finally,nothing in the history of the statute suggests that it is jurisdictional.unlike john sand gravel united states,or bowles russel,where stare decisis required following a long line of cases holding that the particular statutes of limitations were jurisdictional,this is not a situation in which longstanding precedent has interpreted the provision as jurisdictional.see sikorsky,at.accordingly,because congress failed to provide anything like the clear statement the court has demanded before deeming a statute of limitations jurisdictional,we hold that i is not jurisdictional.kwai fun wong.at.we thus need not address the limitations issue if the cit properly dismissed the claims on other grounds.
we first address whether the cit abused its discretion in declining to issue declaratory relief for ford claims with respect to claim and all claims directed to the entries.we review a trial court decision to decline declaratory relief for abuse of discretion.wilton,at sony,at.an abuse of discretion may occur when the trial court decision was based on an incorrect conclusion of law or clearly erroneous findings of fact,was devoid of any evidence in the record upon which the court rationally could have based its decision,or was clearly unreasonable or arbitrary.serco servs,kelley,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the declaratory judgment act provides that i n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.trial courts retain unique and substantial discretion in deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief.wilton,at.t here is no absolute right to a declaratory judgment,for the statute specifically entrusts courts with discretion to hear declaratory suits or not depending on the circumstances.serco servs,at.trial courts must determine whether hearing the case would serve the objectives for which the declaratory judgment act was created,namely,allowing a party who is reasonably at legal risk because of an unresolved legal dispute to obtain judicial resolution of that dispute without having to await the commencement of legal action by the other side.capo,dioptics med,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.there must be reasons for declining to entertain a declaratory judgment action.id.
in the original appeal,while we vacated the cit discretionary dismissals of the declaratory claims,we remanded with the understanding that the court of international trade retains authority,but no obligation,to revisit this question on remand.ford ii,at.on remand,the cit again declined to issue discretionary declaratory relief for most of ford claims,explaining that adjudicating the claims would not be an efficient and effective use of the court time and resources,because ford retains the ability to seek relief for these claims in its pending protest and a action.ford iii,d at.the cit further explained that t he a case will allow ford to challenge not only the question of whether the entries in question were deemed liquidated,but the substance of any actual liquidations or reliquidations that occurred,the merits of ford reconciliation claims,an option not available in this declaratory judgment case.id.ford contends that the cit abused its discretion in declining to exercise discretionary jurisdiction because of the general rule favoring actions and because it would be less efficient to defer resolution until the a actions.we disagree.
as ford points out,actions are generally preferred unless considerations of judicial and litigant economy,and the just and effective disposition of disputes,require otherwise.serco,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.accordingly,the trial court discretion tempers the preference for the suit,when such preference should yield to the forum in which all interests are best served.id.internal quo
