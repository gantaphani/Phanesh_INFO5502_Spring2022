catherine broderick filed suit against her employer,the securities and exchange commission sec,alleging retaliation under title vii of the civil rights act of as well as violations of a court order issued in her previous sexual harassment suit against the sec.the district court granted summary judgment against broderick on the retaliation claim and declined to hold the sec in contempt for the alleged violations of the order.broderick now appeals both decisions.
we find the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the sec,as broderick has not stated a prima facie case of retaliation.additionally,we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to hold the sec in contempt of the order.we therefore affirm.
catherine broderick won a sexual harassment suit against the sec in.broderick ruder.after her victory,the district court entered an order entitling broderick to a promotion to,a title commensurate with status,and a 
transfer to a position in the division of enforcement or the office of the general counsel at the level,with appropriate work assignments,training,evaluation standards,and increased responsibilities over time as she acquires the training and experience and as she demonstrates the capabilities to assume such responsibilities.
broderick ruder,wl,at june.the order also specified that the sec would provide two sets of performance standards,one detailing the initial duties and responsibilities assigned to broderick in light of her current training and experience,and the other setting forth the full duties and responsibilities she will be expected to assume after she acquires the training and experience and demonstrates the proficiency necessary to assume those duties and responsibilities.id.at.consistent with this order,broderick who had previously been employed as an attorney at the level was given a position in the appellate group of the office of the general counsel,with the job title counsel to the assistant general counsel.broderick has remained in that position since.
broderick now claims she did not get a fresh start in the appellate group,appellant br.at,because a lot of people from that office attended her sexual harassment trial,and some were associate s of attorneys in her former office,id.at.jacob stillman,head of the appellate group,allegedly said at some point that broderick was here because of the lawsuit.and,you know,we did want her here but she here.and she gets paid at this level and she ca do the work.despite her unique title and higher pay grade,broderick duties,preparing first drafts of briefs,were essentially equivalent to those of a staff attorney.a staff attorney briefs are typically reviewed by an assistant general counsel or a senior litigation counsel,and then by either the solicitor stillman or his deputy.broderick duties were also similar to those of a special counsel a position,except that a special counsel may at times supervise another attorney work and may have his work reviewed directly by the solicitor or the deputy solicitor.
broderick performance evaluations for the years all rated her as outstanding overall,the highest possible rating.in all six of those years,she was rated as outstanding in four of five categories research,oral communications,writing,and compliance with administrative requirements.in the fifth category,analysis,she received an exceeds fully successful rating each year,the possible rating.as of,broderick was still being evaluated according to the initial set of performance standards that were drafted in response to the order.
at least four of broderick supervisors have stated that they do not think she should be in a supervisory position jacob stillman i do think that given those concerns about her analysis that she should be supervising people,katharine gresham i doubt broderick could handle a supervisory role b ecause she still needs to be supervised,mark pennington t o the extent that being a senior litigation counsel required a supervisory role,i think broderick legal analysis would be strong enough,and randy quinn i guess i would not feel completely comfortable with broderick supervising another attorney.in and,broderick applied for vacant assistant general counsel positions but was not selected.on june,broderick sent a memo to her supervisors in the appellate group and to the office of equal employment opportunity,complaining that she had been with the appellate group for ten years without being promoted.she requested a change in job title and position commensurate with her seniority,experience,and outstanding performance appraisals.she also requested that her career ladder be clarified,since it was unclear to her how she was expected to move into the supervisory ranks when the entry level is at the level.
in december,two senior litigation counsel vacancies in the appellate group were announced broderick submitted an application but was not selected.hope augustini and rada potts,two other appellate group attorneys,were chosen for the positions on february.broderick was informed of the decision that same day,and she contacted an equal employment opportunity eeo counselor in order to complain.on june,broderick,jacob stillman,and katharine gresham participated in a mediation session connected with broderick eeo complaint.
broderick allegedly became angry and unfriendly toward gresham after gresham became aware of broderick eeo complaint.on july,stillman sent broderick a memo claiming that when gresham tried to discuss the situation with broderick,broderick became hostile,raised her voice,and made highly inappropriate comments about katharine mother and suggestions to katharine that she seek psychological assistance.the memo cautioned broderick that her recent course of conduct toward katharine gresham was unacceptable and was inconsistent with the requirements of her performance standards.broderick disputes this account,claiming that she merely responded to gresham request that they be friends.the memo was not placed in broderick personnel file,but the incident was subsequently mentioned in her evaluation.
broderick filed suit against the sec on january,claiming retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,as well as violations of the court order.she requested a finding of civil contempt against the sec for violating the order,with compensatory damages of plus interest,as well as additional monetary penalties until the sec complied with the order.broderick also requested a retroactive assignment to a management position with backpay and benefits,retroactive awards and bonuses,and corrections to her personnel file.
the sec moved for summary judgment on broderick retaliation claim the district court granted that motion on september.broderick donaldson,d.the court held that broderick had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to any allegedly adverse actions that occurred before december.id.at.next,the court held broderick had failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of retaliation,because only the previous lawsuit qualified as a protected activity,only the denials of her applications for supervisory positions constituted adverse actions,and broderick had not shown a causal connection between the first two elements.id.at.alternatively,the court found that even if broderick had stated a prima facie case of retaliation,the sec had proffered justifications for its actions,which broderick had not rebutted.id.at.
the court also declined to hold the sec in contempt for alleged violations of the court order.id.at.finding no proof of discriminatory motives,the court held that it could not review the sec determination that broderick had not progressed professionally to the point where she should be given additional responsibilities.id.at.even assuming both that broderick had made the requisite professional progress and that the court rather than the sec should make the determination of such progress,the court found the language of the order too subjective and imprecise for a finding of civil contempt.id.at.finally,the court determined the sec assessment of broderick,as not yet possessing the requisite skil
