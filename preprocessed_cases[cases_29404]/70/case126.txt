by order filed in november,this panel referred hector roman to this court committee on admissions and grievances the committee for investigation of the matters described in that order and preparation of a report on whether he should be subject to disciplinary or other corrective measures.supplemental referral orders were filed in april.
during the committee proceedings,roman had the opportunity to address the matters discussed in the court referral order,to testify under oath at a hearing held in december,and to present supplementary materials.roman represented himself during the committee proceedings.presiding over the hearing were committee chair mary jo white,and the honorable howard levine.in january,the committee filed with the court the record of the committee proceedings and its report and recommendations.thereafter,the court provided roman with a copy of the committee report,and roman filed a response in april.
in its report,the committee concluded a roman was subject to reciprocal discipline,pursuant to second circuit local rule f,based on the prior imposition of discipline by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit and b as a separate matter,roman was subject to discipline for his behavior in this court,based on clear and convincing evidence that he had engaged in conduct unbecoming a member of the bar within the meaning of federal rule of appellate procedure c.see report at.after finding various aggravating and mitigating factors,see id.at,the committee recommended that roman be suspended from practice before this court for a period,based on both the ninth circuit suspension and his conduct before this court,with each basis operating as an independent ground for the recommended suspension,see id.at.in response,roman states that he does not contest the committee recommendation that he be suspended for three months based on the ninth circuit suspension,but asks that the suspension not be based on his conduct before this court.response at.
upon due consideration of the committee report,the underlying record,and roman response,we adopt the committee factual findings concerning roman ninth circuit suspension and his misconduct in this court.we also adopt the committee conclusions that roman ninth circuit suspension warrants reciprocal suspension by this court and that his separate misconduct in this court was sufficiently serious that it warrants independent disciplinary action.however,for the reasons discussed below,we impose disciplinary sanctions that differ somewhat from those recommended by the committee.
reciprocal discipline 
former second circuit rule f governed this court reciprocal discipline procedures until january,when it was superseded by current second circuit local rule c.we need not decide which version of the rule governs roman case,since the same result is reached under both versions.former local rule f,in pertinent part,provided as follows 
in all cases in which an order disbarring an attorney or suspending the attorney from practice has been entered in any other court of record,federal or state,the clerk shall enter an order for the court disbarring the attorney or suspending the attorney from practice in this court upon terms and conditions comparable to those set forth by the other court of record.
within a specified time period,a motion may be filed in this court either by such attorney or the committee for a modification or revocation of the order of this court.any such motion shall set forth specifically the facts and principles relied on by applicant as showing cause why a different disposition should be ordered by this court.
former second circuit rule f.current local rule c,in pertinent part,provides as follows 
reciprocal order.when the court receives a copy of an order entered by an attorney disciplinary authority disbarring or suspending an attorney from practice,the clerk enters an order disbarring or suspending the attorney from practice before this court on comparable terms and conditions.
motion to modify or vacate.within a specified time period,the attorney may move to modify or vacate the order.
second circuit local rule c.
although this court has not yet explicitly ruled on the issue,we now make clear that former local rule f and current local rule c reflect a rebuttable presumption that the reciprocal discipline imposed by this court will be as close to identical as our rules and the circumstances the discipline imposed by the prior court or other disciplinary authority.this presumption,although not explicitly referred to as such,has long guided this court reciprocal discipline practice and is consistent with the practice of other circuits.see in re williams,cir given the limited nature of our inquiry,the norm will be for this court to impose discipline which is substantially similar to that imposed by the state court also noting that the court disciplinary rule requires imposition of substantially the same discipline as was imposed by the original court in re kramer,cir we inquire only whether the punishment imposed by another disciplinary authority or court was so to an attorney adjudicated misconduct that reciprocal disbarment would result in grave injustice in re fallin,cir court presumes,pursuant to explicit language of local rule,that reciprocal discipline will be identical to original discipline in re hoare,cir although a state court disciplinary action is not conclusively binding upon the federal judiciary,federal courts are nevertheless obliged to accord a high level of deference to state court disbarment proceedings.thus,when a district court learns that a member of its bar has been subject to discipline by another jurisdiction,the identical discipline is typically imposed.citations omitted.see also aba model rules for lawyer disciplinary enforcement,d providing that court shall impose the identical discipline as the prior jurisdiction,unless certain criteria are satisfied,and that t he burden is on the party seeking different discipline to demonstrate that the imposition of the same discipline is not appropriate aba model federal rules of disciplinary enforcement,ii d,providing for identical discipline unless certain criteria are satisfied 
furthermore,the disciplined attorney bears the burden of demonstrating,by clear and convincing evidence,that a different disposition would be appropriate unless the committee,or the court itself,moves for modification or revocation.see in re friedman,cir applying burden of proof in context of appeal from district court imposition of reciprocal discipline.an attorney seeking to demonstrate either that reciprocal discipline should not be imposed at all or that the terms and conditions of the reciprocal discipline should not be comparable to those imposed by the other attorney disciplinary authority,second circuit rule c former second circuit rule f,must satisfy the standard set forth in selling radford,which requires the attorney to show 
t hat the procedure used by the prior court from want of notice or opportunity to be heard,was wanting in due process,that there was such an infirmity of proof as to facts found to have established the want of fair private and professional character as to give rise to a clear conviction on our part that we could not,consistently with our duty,accept as final the conclusion on that subject or,that some other grave reason existed which should convince us that to allow the natural consequences of the judgment to have their effect would conflict with the duty which rests upon us not to disbar or impose any other disciplinary sanction imposed by the prior court except upon the conviction that,under the principles of right and justice,we were constrained so to do.
selling,at.in sum,the selling standard bars reciprocal discipline when the court finds absence of due process in the prior disciplinary procedure,substantial infirmity in the proof of lack of private and professional character,or some other grave reason sufficient to indicate that reciprocal disbarment or other reciprocal discipline i s inconsistent with principles of right and justice.in re tidwell,cir quoting selling,supra.
as noted in in re edelstein,cir,several other courts have supplemented the selling criteria with a fourth reason for not imposing reciprocal,that a reciprocal order should not issue if an attorney misconduct warrants substantially different discipline than that imposed by the court that imposed the original discipline.edelstein,at quoting rule of disciplinary enforcement of the court of appeals for the first circuit ii d.we treat the noted fourth category as subsumed by the grave reason category set forth in selling.see id.at noting the fourth ground for relief considered by some courts but relying on selling to conclude that no grave reason warranted revoking an order of reciprocal discipline kramer,at rejecting argument that original disbarment constituted excessive punishment and concluding that reciprocal disbarment would not result in grave injustice see also theard united states,d finding state court disbarment decision brings title deeds of high respect b ut it is not conclusively binding on the federal courts,and concluding that federal court disbarment in that case was foreclosed by the grave reason prong of selling.
although selling addressed reciprocal discipline imposed by a federal court based on a state court prior disciplinary decision,we have found it equally applicable to a federal court imposition of reciprocal discipline based on another federal court prior disciplinary decision.see edelstein,at.thus,it applies here.
since roman does not contest the process he received in the ninth circuit or allege an infirmity of proof,we now consider only whether it has been demonstrated that some grave reason prohibits the imposition of a reciprocal suspension.in doing so,we do not determine de novo what sanction the ninth circuit should have imposed instead,we accord great deference to the ninth circuit determination.see,theard,at.edelstein,at williams,at kramer,at hoare,at.
in the present case,roman raised several arguments in support of his position that this court should not impose the same discipline as the ninth circuit.the committee rejected one of his arguments,agreed with three others,and independently found that five additional mitigating factors warranted a suspension of three months,rather than a suspension matching the term imposed by the ninth circuit.see report at.notably,the committee found that none of the arguments made by roman raised a grave reason justifying a departure from the practice of imposing reciprocal discipline.see id.at.we concur in the committee rejection of roman argument that his purchase of case management software remedied the problems cited by the ninth circuit.see id.however,for the following reasons,we do not believe that the remaining factors constitute a grave reason justifying a different suspension term.
first,many or most of the cited factors were considered by the ninth circuit when it determined that a suspension was appropriate,and there is no indication that the weight accorded to them by the ninth circuit was so inadequate as to present a grave reason justifying departure from that sanction.see in re roman,report of appellate commissioner,at,cir,discussing mitigating factors,order adopting report cir.
second,the fact that the new york state reciprocal order based on the ninth circuit order only imposed a public censure,not a suspension,is of limited persuasive value.although the new york state courts generally give deference to the court that imposed the original discipline,they do not apply the selling grave reason standard when determining the appropriate form of reciprocal discipline.see,in re whitehead,dep t in deciding on the appropriate sanction in reciprocal discipline matters,it is generally accepted that the state where the misconduct occurred has the greatest interest in the sanction imposed.however,when the sanction in the home state deviates significantly from our precedent,this court has departed from that general policy of deference.citations omitted in re lever,dep t although this court in a reciprocal disciplinary proceeding will often defer to the sanction initially imposed by a foreign jurisdiction,our precedents are equally clear that we are not bound by that sanction,and may impose a more severe penalty if the circumstances warrant.in re marshall,dep t this court is not required to adhere to the disciplinary sanction imposed by the foreign jurisdiction and may impose a greater or lesser sanction.in any event,the new york state order contains no facts or reasoning that would justify,under selling,a sanction different than that imposed by the ninth circuit.see in re roman,dep t.
third,we do not consider roman misconduct before the ninth circuit to have occurred at such a remote time in the past that it renders reciprocal discipline at the current time unjust.both the ninth circuit appellate commissioner report and roman submissions in the present matter indicate that the ninth circuit suspension was based on misconduct occurring in and after and that much of the misconduct involved cases filed in,and.see in re roman,report of appellate commissioner,at,in re roman,cir,roman may response to order to show cause,at dating ninth circuit problems to through.
because the mitigating factors in this case,considered together,do not amount to a grave reason justifying a suspension different than that imposed by the ninth circuit,we impose a reciprocal suspension.
roman misconduct in this court 
we concur with the committee recommendation that a period of suspension also is appropriate for roman misconduct in this court.lesser sanctions,such as a public or private reprimand or censure,would require either less egregious misconduct or greater mitigating factors.see,in re liu,cir although conduct at issue generally would warrant a significantly greater sanction,public censure was imposed instead,based on mitigating factors and imposition of other,onerous corrective measures in re flannery,cir imposing,on four attorneys,discipline ranging from monetary sanctions and public censure to suspension for causing dismissal of clients direct criminal appeals by failing to file briefs and ignoring subsequent orders to show cause why discipline should not be imposed.
we acknowledge roman argument that his misconduct in this court stemmed from the same set of facts and circumstances which led to the original suspension in the ninth circuit.response to committee report at.although different cases and courts were involved,we understand this argument to mean that the same case management deficiencies led to roman problems in both circuits.we agree,but only in part.as noted by the committee,several instances of misconduct in this court the ninth circuit november order to show cause why he should not be disciplined for certain similar misconduct in that court.see report at.moreover,neither the ninth circuit analysis nor logic suggests that the ninth circuit sanction was intended to cover,or should cover,any misconduct other than that discussed in the ninth circuit order.in fact,it is quite possible that,had the ninth circuit been aware of roman additional misconduct in this court,a longer suspension would have been imposed.thus,we do not see complete overlap between the conduct addressed by the ninth circuit and that addressed in this order.additionally,the fact that roman continued to engage in misconduct in this court after being put on notice by the ninth circuit about similar misconduct constitutes a significant aggravating factor.
we also are disturbed by roman misrepresentations to this court when he a permitted others to sign his name to pleadings that he failed to review prior to their filing in this court,and b permitted materially inaccurate information to be submitted to the court in those pleadings.although roman stated that he was very aware of what was going on,hearing tr.at,we believe that he either knew of the misrepresentations,or was guilty of reckless disregard,since he knew that the cases existed and knew that they could not proceed to briefing and decision without the input,and signature,of counsel of record.see fed.d every brief,motion,or other paper filed with the court must be signed by the party filing the paper or,if the party is represented,by one of the party attorneys.far too many cases were involved,and far too much time passed,for any reasonable attorney to claim that he did not know how his cases were advancing to final decision.finally,we also find that the other mitigating factors in this case do not present the type of extraordinary circumstances that might warrant divergence from the sanction called for by roman misconduct.
due to the partial overlap between the misconduct in the two circuits,we do not impose a lengthy term of suspension in addition to that imposed by the ninth circuit.however,we find that the lack of complete overlap warrants a consecutive,rather than concurrent,additional suspension.we believe that the additional,consecutive,term of suspension should be one month,for a total suspension term of seven months.
conclusions 
upon due consideration,it is hereby ordered that,except as noted above,the committee findings and recommendations are adopted by the court,and roman is publicly reprimanded and suspended from practice before this court for a period of seven months,based on the misconduct described in the committee report.the suspension period will commence on the date of filing of this order.it is further ordered that roman communicate with his clients in all of his pending cases,as specified in the committee report.see report at,conclusion.
the text of this panel november and april orders and the committee report are appended to,and deemed part of,the present order for the following disclosure purposes.roman must disclose this order to all clients in cases currently pending in this court and to all courts and bars of which he is currently a member,and as required by any bar or court rule or order.furthermore,the clerk of court is directed to release this order to the public by posting it on this court web site and providing copies to members of the public in the same manner as all other published decisions of this court,and to serve a copy on roman,this court committee on admissions and grievances,the attorney disciplinary committee for the new york state appellate division,second department,the executive office for immigration review,the bars and courts listed on page of the committee report,and all other courts and jurisdictions to which this court distributes disciplinary decisions in the ordinary course.

roman is an active immigration practitioner before the court,and the court orders raise several areas of concern regarding his conduct,including frequent defaults on scheduling orders,boilerplate motions,defective briefing,and previous disciplinary sanctions against roman.roman was previously suspended by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit ninth circuit for six months for declining to properly supervise an associate,relying upon inadequate case management systems,failing to prosecute numerous cases and violating court rules and orders as a form of reciprocal discipline,the supreme court of the state of new york,appellate division,second judicial department new york appellate division imposed public censure on roman.

iii.this disciplinary proceeding 
on march,this committee issued an order to show cause regarding roman conduct as alleged in referral order by letter dated march,roman was provided with copies of referral orders ii and iii.after requesting an extension of time on april,which was granted,roman submitted a comprehensive written response to the order to show cause response on may.a hearing was initially scheduled for june,but roman requested a waiver of the hearing.
by letter dated october,the committee requested additional documents from roman concerning his client retainer agreement.in response,roman submitted a second submission to the committee on november,second response.although roman waived a hearing,the committee decided to hold a hearing,which occurred on december,conducted by a consisting of mary jo white and the howard levine.roman appeared pro se,and presented no witnesses,but responded under oath to questions.on december,roman provided a submission to the committee third response.
iv.factual background 
the following facts are taken from court records,roman may,written submissions to the committee and testimony provided at the december,hearing.
roman is currently a managing partner at roman singh llp,located at street,suite,jackson heights,new york.he graduated from hofstra university school of law in,and passed the new york and new jersey bar examinations during that year.roman also passed the california bar exam in.in,roman formed roman singh llp with attorney jaspreet singh.roman has an active practice in bankruptcy,criminal law,matrimonial and family law,residential real estate transactions,commercial transactions and immigration law.roman partner,singh,focuses primarily on immigration law.immigration matters account for percent of the firm total caseload.roman currently has asylum cases pending before the second circuit,which is representative of his average caseload over the past few years.
roman is currently admitted to practice in new york,new jersey and california,and is a member in good standing of the federal district courts for the eastern district of new york,southern district of new york,northern district of new york and northern district of california.
on march,roman was suspended from practice before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit for six months and was required to pay a monetary sanction of.under the ninth circuit suspension order,reinstatement before the court was contingent upon roman submitting the following a written showing that he is familiar with,and willing to comply with,the federal rules of appellate procedure,ninth circuit rules,and the ninth circuit orders evidence that he is in good standing,with no disciplinary actions pending,in all courts and bars to which he is admitted and proof that he has successfully completed six of continuing legal education cle in the areas of immigration law or federal appellate practice,and an additional four of cle in the area of law office management,in addition to the required of all active attorneys.exhibit c,at.
as a result of the disciplinary sanctions imposed by the ninth circuit,roman was reciprocally suspended from the united states court of appeals for the third circuit,the federal district court for the district of new jersey,the department of homeland security dhs,the board of immigration appeals bia and the immigration courts executive office for immigration review,eoir.each of the reciprocal suspensions were for a period of six months and ended in.according to roman,these sanctions were imposed solely as reciprocal discipline roman was not found to have engaged in misconduct before those tribunals.as previously stated,on december,the new york appellate division imposed reciprocal discipline on roman by issuing a public censure.
in his submissions to the committee,roman said that he had not sought reinstatement in any of the jurisdictions from which he was suspended,including the ninth circuit,because his primary practice is in new york state and federal courts.roman emphasized that b y limiting my practice to courts located within new york state,i will be able to better control my caseload and case management going forward into the future.response,at.however,at the hearing,roman explained that he eventually plans to move for readmission to the dhs,bia and eoir.hearing transcript tr.at.roman added that,in order to move for readmission before those tribunals,he must first be readmitted to the ninth circuit.id.roman has complied with two of the ninth circuit conditions for of a fine and attendance at a cle program.tr.roman plans to complete the only remaining requirement for readmission,filing a motion for reinstatement,at some point in the future.id.
legal standard 
under the rules of this committee,
an attorney may be subject to discipline or other corrective measures for any act or omission that violates the rules of professional conduct or responsibility of the state or other jurisdiction where the attorney maintains his or her principal office,or the rules of professional conduct of any other state or jurisdiction governing the attorney conduct.an attorney may also be subject to discipline or other corrective measures for any failure to comply with a federal rule of appellate procedure,a local rule of the court,an order or other instruction of the court,or a rule of professional conduct or responsibility of the court,or any other conduct unbecoming a member of the bar.
rules of the committee on admissions and grievances,rule.
a court of appeals may discipline an attorney who practices before it for conduct unbecoming a member of the bar or for failure to comply with any court rule.fed.c.conduct unbecoming a member of the bar may include any conduct contrary to professional standards that show s an unfitness to discharge continuing obligations to clients or courts,or conduct inimical to the administration of justice.in re snyder,d.for m ore specific guidance,we may look to case law,applicable court rules,and the lore of the profession,as embodied in codes of professional conduct.id.at.
courts have consistently treated neglect of client matters and ineffective or incompetent representation as sanctionable conduct.see,gadda ashcroft,cir,amnesty am.town of hartford,cir,matter of rabinowitz,united states song,cir,matter of kraft,in re bithoney,cir.such conduct is also sanctionable under the applicable professional rules and standards.the american bar association standards for imposing lawyer sanctions aba standards call for a range of sanctions from reprimand to disbarment for various forms of lack of diligence and lack of competence.aba standards.the disciplinary rules of new york lawyer code of professional responsibility require that a lawyer shall not n eglect a legal matter entrusted to the lawyer,a in addition,the code ethical canons require that the lawyer should represent his or her client zealously,canon,and that he or she be punctual in fulfilling all professional commitments,canon.

vi.the alleged misconduct 
defaults on scheduling orders 
the evidence demonstrates that roman failed to comply with court scheduling orders,and failed to prosecute his clients cases diligently.
roman acknowledges wrongdoing in one case,kaur bia,docket.according to roman,he admit s to law office failure in that instance.response,at.roman stated that he explained the dismissal to the client and filed motion to reinstate,the brief and the joint appendix free of charge.however,the motion to reinstate was denied.
with regard to of the petitions that were dismissed for roman failure to comply with the court scheduling orders,roman submits that he lost contact with the clients.according to roman,in several of these instances,the clients did not pay their legal fees or respond to his telephone and written inquiries.with the exception of kaur,discussed above,roman decided not to file briefs in these cases due to his inability to communicate with the clients,but admittedly,roman failed properly to seek to withdraw,or to stipulate to the dismissal of the appeal.accordingly,even if roman clients were not in fact prejudiced by roman failure to file the briefs,roman failure to comply with proper procedures for withdrawal or dismissal of the appeal violated the court scheduling orders and his obligation either to represent his clients or terminate the representation.moreover,roman conduct disrupted the court proceedings and burdened the court staff with additional work.see bennett mukasey,cir a a lawyer shall not withdraw from employment without complying with applicable laws and rules.
in another seven cases,roman asserts that failure to file briefs in a timely manner resulted from circumstances outside of his control,including failure to receive the administrative record,a client actions while he was proceeding pro se prior to roman representation,the court sua sponte dismissal of an action,failure of subsequently retained counsel to file a timely brief,and deportation of the petitioner prior to the due date of the brief.
roman subsequently filed motions to reinstate eleven of the dismissed petitions five of those motions were granted,five were denied and one was withdrawn.in those five cases in which roman unsuccessfully moved to reinstate,the record does not show whether the petitioners were substantially prejudiced.according to roman,he did not believe that the outcomes would have been different in most of the defaulted cases,but he conceded that some clients could have been prejudiced.tr.in any case,it is apparent that roman conduct had the potential to cause significant injury to his clients.
since the defaults and the commencement of disciplinary proceedings against him in the ninth circuit,roman has taken steps to improve his office management,including installing case management and calendaring software.tr.roman believes that these new systems have successfully addressed the firm deadline issues.id.in addition,roman is now aware that,when clients are uncooperative in prosecuting their appeals,he should file motions to withdraw.tr.s ince this investigation has started,i have made the appropriate motion to withdraw on two matters where clients were not responding to me.the committee has confirmed that in,roman did not default on any cases and timely applied for extensions of time in all but one instance 
both aggravating and mitigating factors are present.the aggravating factors considered by the committee include roman prior disciplinary sanctions by the ninth circuit for failure to comply with that court scheduling orders roman pattern of dilatory conduct and the vulnerability of roman immigrant clients.aba standards a,c h.the mitigating factors present are roman good faith effort to rectify the consequences of his misconduct by filing motions to reinstate those cases that were dismissed for failure to comply with the court scheduling orders roman remorse roman cooperation with these proceedings and absence of a dishonest or selfish,although roman may not have intended to neglect his clients,it was roman decision to greatly increase his caseload without making adequate provision to protect his clients from the risks inherent in an practice.aba standards d,i,e b.

in a number of cases,roman submitted boilerplate motions for extensions of time and motions to reinstate stating that he either had not received a copy of the scheduling order or had not received a response to a previous motion for an extension of time.according to the court,roman either knew,or likely knew,that scheduling orders existed in those cases.referral order i,at.for instance,in the case of bia,the petitioner motion to reinstate argues that petitioner counsel never received the briefing schedule.tr.ex.however,the docket shows that the petitioner filed a motion for an extension of time on march,clearly indicating that petitioner counsel was,in fact,aware of the briefing schedule.id.
according to roman written response,all of the extension requests were based upon either a need for additional time to prepare,loss of contact with the client,or delays in obtaining the administrative record.in his response,roman does not explain why,if these were the reasons why he needed extensions,he represented to the court that he had not received scheduling orders or had not received a response from the court to a previous request for an extension.roman also does not explain why he used boilerplate motions,rather than crafting individual motions for each request that he made to the court.
at the hearing,roman admitted that he had not personally prepared the misleading motions to reinstate in the cases listed in the referral order.tr.according to roman,his partner,singh,singh secretary,prepared the motions to reinstate and signed roman initials to the documents.tr.roman explained that,for a period of several years during which the boilerplate motions were filed,he was admitted to practice before the second circuit and the ninth circuit,while singh was not.tr.singh would handle the firm immigration cases before these courts,but roman was officially the counsel of record accordingly,roman name was on all of the documents filed with the courts 
my name went on the ninth circuit cases and my name went on the second circuit cases.i was loosely following these cases,but mainly relying on my partner to handle these cases,and for that i take full responsibility,again.a lot of the work that was performed i relied on my partner,even though i should have said to my partner,if these are your cases and if these are your clients who you taking in these cases,then i think it best if you get admitted into the second circuit and handle these cases in your name.same for the ninth circuit.
during the time that a lot of these problems came,to be honest with you,you honor,i was very aware of what was going on.i relied,and my signature was signed without my knowledge,and without my consent,and it a tough situation.
tr.according to roman,singh is now admitted to the ninth circuit and handles all of the firm cases before that court.tr.roman continues to handle the second circuit cases,and since,has personally overseen the management and filings in those cases.tr.roman no longer permits singh to file documents before the second circuit under roman name.
roman was also asked whether he had omitted any substantive discussion of the boilerplate motions in his response to the committee in order to avoid addressing the issue of whether his partner had filed motions before the court under his name.tr.roman said it was possible that he had omitted a thorough discussion of the boilerplate motions in order to avoid this issue,but he was not certain that he had done so.id.as the committee generally found roman to be credible,there is no clear and convincing evidence that he deliberately misled the committee in his written response.
roman conduct,in allowing motions to be filed before the court that misrepresented that he served as counsel in those cases and had approved such submissions and were misleading with regard to the reasons for moving to reinstate requesting an extension of time,is in clear violation of dr a,which holds that a lawyer or law firm shall not e ngage in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit or misrepresentation.moreover,to the extent that roman was responsible for supervising singh handling of cases for which he was counsel of record,he should have taken reasonable efforts to ensure that singh representations to the court were accurate and did not violate any disciplinary rule.dr b,c d 
the aggravating factors with regard to this conduct are multiple offenses and vulnerability of roman immigrant clients.aba standards d h.a mitigating factor is roman full and free disclosure to the committee of his culpability in this conduct.aba standards e.
fee retainer 
the committee also finds that the standard retainer agreement that roman used for a time was in violation of the disciplinary rules in new york therefore,roman use of such an agreement with his clients is sanctionable misconduct.in his response,roman attaches exhibit j,which he describes as the sample retainer letter which we provide to our clients.response,at.page of exhibit j provides as follows 
you understand and agree that any legal fees paid are not refundable under any circumstances,and that if you wish to terminate this retainer agreement you will first make the next payment following the last payment already made or due according to this retainer agreement,as well as pay all prior payments overdue plus pay all outstanding disbursements expended on this immigration matter.
emphasis added.
it is now that retainer agreements constitute per se violations of the disciplinary rules of new york code of professional responsibility.a lawyer who withdraws from employment shall refund promptly any part of a fee paid in advance that has not been earned.see also a,c prohibiting charging of excessive fees and fees proscribed by law or rule of court see also matter of cooperman,matter of.
by letter dated october,the committee asked roman to submit a supplemental written response detailing his use of the retainer agreement,including a list of cases in which clients had requested refunds of their retainers and were denied refunds pursuant to the agreement.roman was also asked to submit any subsequent retainer agreements used and to provide a statement addressing whether such agreements comply with applicable law,rules and regulations.
in his response,roman stated that he began using a retainer agreement that referred to a retainer in.second response,at.according to roman,in crafting this agreement,he relied upon the language set forth in a sample representation letter posted by the american immigration lawyers association aila on its website.id.at exhibit roman only used the retainer language in the representation letters for clients who sought to tile second circuit appeals.id.at.roman declared that no such clients have ever requested refunds of legal fees.id.roman also emphasized that the retainer language was intended to refer only to legal services already performed,as he would never withhold legal fees for services that were not rendered.id.at see also tr.
roman also said that,upon receiving the committee letter,he had revised his retainer agreement to omit the retainer language.id.he submitted the revised retainer agreement to the committee in his second response,exhibit a.at the hearing,roman also stated that he would further edit the revised retainer agreement in order to make it clear that clients would only be required to pay for services rendered.tr.
an aggravating factor with regard to this conduct is the vulnerability of roman immigrant clients.aba standards h.there are several mitigating factors absence of prior discipline,absence of a dishonest or selfish motive,good faith effort to rectify the consequence of his misconduct,full cooperation with the committee,inexperience in the practice of law,as demonstrated in part by roman reliance on the aila sample retainer,and remorse.
deficient briefing 
the committee has reviewed all of the briefs cited in the referral order,and finds that roman filed defective briefs in at least three cases in and.
in kaur bia,roman brief failed to address the central issues identified by the immigration judge below and included a claim under the convention against torture cat that was not raised before the ij and therefore had not been exhausted.in his response,roman apologized with regard to inclusion of the cat claim,stating i sincerely apologize to the court for having included the cat claim and would like to point out that this was a one time isolated incident and human error it was an oversight for which i am sorry for sic and assure that it will never happen again.response,at.
in kaur bia,roman recycled boilerplate from other briefs,erroneously referred to the female petitioner using male pronouns,referred to persecution by the punjab police though the petitioner was not from punjab,and used the term bia to refer to the court.according to roman,these mistakes were caused by haste and human error,and did not prejudice the petitioner,whose case was remanded in part to the bia for further proceedings.response,at.
in mehmi gonzales,roman failed to address the extensive and detailed concerns raised in the ij decision that was subsequently adopted and supplemented by the bia.according to roman,his failure to do so was caused by the fact that he relied upon an incorrect statement by the bia,and he can not be faulted for basing his brief upon the bia mistake.response,at.roman response does not acknowledge that he was responsible for addressing both the bia and the ij opinions in his brief.see mehmi,cir,t his court reviews the decision of the ij as supplemented by the bia.based upon the court decision,it appears that roman client may have been significantly prejudiced by this omission.id.as an initial matter,the government correctly notes that petitioner never challenged the ij discretionary denial of asylum before the bia.nor has petitioner raised this issue in his brief to this court.therefore,we deem any challenge to such denial abandoned.
at the hearing,roman stated that he had not personally prepared the briefs cited in referral order tr.in fact,these briefs were drafted either by singh or his assistant.tr.roman said that he had reviewed such briefs in order to submit his response to the committee,and concluded that some of the language was subpar in the briefs that roman had not prepared or reviewed prior to filing with the court.tr.now that roman personally handles all of the second circuit cases for which he is counsel of record,he reviews and marks up each and every brief before it is filed.tr.he also instructs the associate who drafts the briefs as to case strategy,format,and appropriate issues to be addressed at the appellate review stage.tr.roman believes that,under the new system,the briefs filed before the court have been of a far superior quality to those cited in the referral order.id.the committee has reviewed a sampling of the briefs filed by roman in and finds that roman latest briefs demonstrate significant improvement upon the defective briefs described supra,and do not exhibit any of the briefing errors cited in the court referral order.nevertheless,roman is responsible for his failure to properly supervise the work of the attorneys in his office with regard to the preparation and filing of the deficient briefs.dr b c.
the aggravating factors concerning roman submission of deficient briefs include roman prior disciplinary sanctions before the ninth circuit on the basis of deficient briefing,roman filing of deficient briefs on multiple occasions,and the vulnerability of roman immigrant clients.aba standards a,d h.the mitigating factors present are absence of a dishonest or selfish motive,a cooperative attitude towards these proceedings,and roman remorse.aba standards b,e l.
vii.recommendation 
reciprocal discipline 
as a result of roman suspension by the ninth circuit,he is subject to reciprocal discipline in this court under local rule f,which provides that 
suspension or disbarment.suspension or disbarment shall be governed by rule,federal rules of appellate procedure 
in all cases in which an order disbarring an attorney or suspending the attorney from practice whether or not on consent has been entered in any other court of record,federal or state,and a certified copy thereof has been filed in this court,the clerk shall enter an order for the court,to become effective days after the date of service upon the attorney unless sooner modified or stayed,disbarring the attorney or suspending the attorney from practice in this court upon terms and conditions comparable to those set forth by the other court of record 
the rule also provides the attorney with an opportunity to move for modification or revocation of the court order.see local rule f.
in evaluating whether to impose reciprocal discipline,the second circuit has relied upon the supreme court decision in selling radford,which addressed the circumstances under which the supreme court should disbar an attorney who had been disbarred from the highest court in michigan.following selling,the second circuit has held that reciprocal discipline should not be imposed under three circumstances absence of due process in the state procedure,substantial infirmity in the proof of lack of private and professional character,or some other grave reason sufficient to indicate that reciprocal discipline was inconsistent with principles of right and justice.in re drew tidwell,cir quoting selling,at.see also in re edelstein,cir same.
roman does not there is no the ninth circuit disciplinary proceedings lacked due process or that the conclusions reached by the ninth circuit were not supported by adequate proof.in asserting that similar discipline should not be imposed by this court,roman argues that there were mitigating factors acknowledged by the ninth circuit the new york appellate division reviewed the ninth circuit order and imposed only public censure,not suspension,as reciprocal discipline the case management problems identified by the ninth circuit from through were remedied by roman purchase of case management software and have not continued and roman main shortcoming in the ninth circuit was a failure to supervise attorneys in his california office who he erroneously and naively assumed were properly handling the ninth circuit appeals.response,at.
the committee finds that the factors cited by roman do not constitute grave reason not to impose suspension as a reciprocal sanction,as contemplated in selling.in particular,roman argument that his case management problems were fixed by the purchase of relevant software is belied by the fact that roman either defaulted or filed late motions for extensions of time in at least eight cases in the second circuit after he represented to the ninth circuit on may,that the case management software had been installed and the firm case management iss
