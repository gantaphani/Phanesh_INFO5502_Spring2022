jeffrey and sherry sneller together,the snellers appeal from a sanction award to the city of bainbridge island the city,meghan mcknight,bob earl,and darlene kordonowy collectively,defendants under federal rule of civil procedure and.the snellers argue that imposition of the sanction was error because they effectively withdrew any claims that violated rule b during the safe harbor period,before defendants filed their motion for sanctions.we agree and therefore reverse 
background 
this case arises from a land use dispute between the snellers and the city over the snellers efforts to develop property which included a wetland.the snellers brought suit in federal court against the city,several of its employees,and other defendants no longer parties to this appeal.
the city,alleging that certain claims were frivolous,requested that those claims be dropped and that the individual city employees be dismissed from the lawsuit.the city prepared a motion for sanctions under rule and and served the motion on the snellers attorney on august.the motion specifically requested that the snellers drop their claim for violations of the washington state constitution,their claim of civil conspiracy,and all claims against the individual defendants.the city also moved for partial summary judgment on the snellers state constitutional law and civil conspiracy claims,as well as all claims against the individual defendants employed by the city.
three days before the end of the safe harbor period,the snellers filed a motion to amend their complaint and submitted a proposed third amended complaint which omitted each of the claims referenced in defendants motion for sanctions.the third amended complaint,however,added two new causes of action.
after the motion to amend was served on the snellers and the period required by rule,see.c,had passed,the city filed the motion for sanctions with the district court.on september,the district court granted the city motion for partial summary judgment,denied the snellers motion to amend their complaint,and granted the city motion for sanctions.the court granted the sanction under both rule and against the snellers and their counsel of record.
on october,the snellers moved to dismiss with prejudice their remaining federal claims and all claims against the individual defendants.they also sought to dismiss without prejudice their remaining state law claims.the district court granted the snellers motion to dismiss,and the snellers now appeal the imposition of sanctions under rule and.
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over the final decisions of the district courts under.ordinarily,a voluntary dismissal without prejudice is not an appealable final judgment.concha london,cir.however,when a party that has suffered an adverse partial judgment subsequently dismisses remaining claims without prejudice with the approval of the district court,and the record reveals no evidence of intent to manipulate our appellate jurisdiction,the judgment entered after the district court grants the motion to dismiss is final and appealable under.james price stern sloan,cir.
here,the snellers suffered an adverse partial judgment when the district court granted the city motion for partial summary judgment,there is no evidence that the snellers moved to dismiss the claims without prejudice in order to manipulate appellate jurisdiction,and defendants do not contend otherwise.instead,the snellers reason for the dismissal,that the remaining claims are state law claims and that any future suit will be in state court,appears legitimate.see am.states ins.dastar,cir noting that the plaintiff in james offered a legitimate reason for dismissal.we therefore have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.
we review the district court imposition of rule sanctions for abuse of discretion.detabali luke,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it applies the incorrect legal standard or bases its ruling on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.cooter gell hartmarx.
rule authorizes a court to impose a sanction on any attorney,law firm,or party that brings a claim for an improper purpose or without support in law or evidence.rule c,however,provides a safe harbor period.under this provision,rule sanctions may not be imposed if the challenged claim is withdrawn within days after service of the sanctions motion.c see also barber miller,cir.the question before this court is whether the snellers challenged claims were withdrawn for purposes of rule within the safe harbor period.
on august,defendants served the snellers with a rule motion requesting that plaintiffs dismiss their claims for violations of the washington state constitution,civil conspiracy,and all claims against the individual defendants.the snellers responded eighteen days later with a motion for leave to amend their complaint so as to satisfy these requests.the snellers proposed third amended complaint omitted each of the claims referenced in defendants motion for sanctions.by filing the motion to amend within the safe harbor period,the snellers withdrew all of the challenged claims as required by rule there is nothing more that the snellers were required to do in terms of withdrawing the challenged claims.see truesdell cal.permanente med.group,cir noting that amendment of a complaint cures a rule defect.although the dissent suggests that there were several other ways,besides a motion to amend,for the snellers to withdraw their offending claims,the availability of those additional suggested methods,even if true,are irrelevant.all that rule required is that the snellers withdrew their claims within the safe harbor period.as explained above,they did.
defendants contend that the snellers did not withdraw their challenged claims as required by rule because they did not dismiss their claims with prejudice under rule a a ii,their proposed amendment to the complaint added new causes of action,and they failed completely to excise the names of one of the individual defendants from their third amended complaint.
the rule safe harbor provision,by its plain language,does not require that a party drop its claims with prejudice all that rule requires is that the offending pleading be withdrawn.rule also does not require that a party voluntarily dismiss its entire case under rule a a ii where the motion for sanctions references only some of the claims or parties set forth in a complaint.filing a motion for leave to amend the complaint under rule thus constitutes effective withdrawal because it is the only procedure available under the rules to withdraw individual challenged claims.see hells canyon council forest,cir noting that rule,rather than rule,controls the situation where a plaintiff desires to eliminate some but not all of its claims.
it is true that the third amended complaint added two new causes of action.however,for rule purposes,it makes no difference that the proposed amended complaint may have included additional offending claims.the rule motion is directed only at the claims made in the second amended complaint.those claims are not the subject of this rule motion.the proper procedure for challenging any offending claims,if the amended pleading is allowed,is to file a new rule motion 
finally,although the third amended complaint mentions city employee meghan mcknight in describing the factual context of the case,she is not named as a defendant in the caption of the complaint,nor does her name appear in any of the sections describing the snellers causes of action,and the third amended complaint seeks no relief against her.because the third amended complaint can not be interpreted as asserting a claim against mcknight or any of the other individual defendants,the mere reference to mcknight in the third amended complaint is an insufficient basis to support the sanction.
at the end of the day,the snellers did all that they were required to do to withdraw the offending claims during the safe harbor period.because their motion was filed within the safe harbor period,the snellers complied with rule requirement that the challenged claim be withdrawn or appropriately corrected.that was all that was required of them in order to receive the benefit of the safe harbor provision 
because the sanction can not be upheld under rule,we must next examine whether it can be affirmed on the alternative basis on which the district court expressly relied,to support the imposition of the sanction.the short answer is that it can not.the sanction here was imposed jointly on counsel and the client,but authorizes sanctions only upon counsel.see ftc alaska land leasing,cir.moreover,the district court made no finding that counsel did,or acted with the purpose to,so multipl y the proceedings unreasonably and vexatiously,or that counsel acted recklessly or in bad faith.see maui police dep t,cir.thus,the alternative basis for the sanction must also be reversed as unauthorized by the statute.
conclusion 
while we agree with the district court that the snellers and their counsel conduct of this litigation in the district court was less than exemplary and understand the district court frustration nonetheless,for the reasons we have explained,the district court order imposing sanctions on the snellers and their counsel under rule and must be and is 
l ess than exemplary is a generous description of jeffrey and sherry mills sneller behavior during the course of this litigation.if there were ever a case in which sanctions were appropriate,this is that case.the snellers improper litigation tactics spanned many months and cost the city of bainbridge island the city tens of thousands of dollars in unnecessary attorney fees.
after a land use dispute with the city,the snellers filed suit against the city,individual city employees,the washington state department of ecology,and several state employees.the city argued that the suit against the individual city employees was brought for an improper purpose and that several of the snellers claims were frivolous and unwarranted by existing law 
sneller own words demonstrate beyond cavil that the suit against the city employees was nothing more than a tactical maneuver designed to harass and intimidate public employees.see.b stating that an attorney must not file a pleading with the court that is presented for any improper purpose,such as to harass,cause unnecessary delay,or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.on october,sneller spoke at the kitsap alliance of property owners meeting.the meeting was videotaped and aired locally on community public television under the title jeffrey sneller man on fire.during his speech,sneller explained why he had brought suit against the city employees 
m unicipalities and government do have weaknesses 
their weakness is individual staff members.and we decided when we filed suit against the city of bainbridge that we were going to those staff members that were responsible individually.
now,you might say,well,what good is that what does that solve because,after all,their government is going to indemnify them and they have a big war chest.well,that is not necessarily the case.these staff members apply for credit cards just like all of us.they apply for home loans and they apply for car loans.and when they have a lawsuit pending,every time you fill out that application,it says,are you a defendant in a lawsuit they better check that box,because it going to be checked in any event by the company issuing the credit.
if you have a two or lawsuit pending against you as a defendant,you not going to get a cell phone.so that was the approach we took 
tellingly,the snellers do not argue on appeal that these claims were appropriate or.
the city repeatedly tried to convince the snellers to withdraw the improper claims,and the snellers refused time and time again.the city also extended every professional courtesy to give them adequate time to respond and to accommodate a change in counsel.months went by without a response from the snellers.the record demonstrates that the city repeatedly requested dismissal of the improper claims in writing on january,march,june,july,and july,before serving the snellers with the motion for sanctions under federal rule of civil procedure rule on july.pursuant to rule safe harbor provision the city did not file the motion with the court at that time.on the eighteenth day of the safe harbor period,the snellers responded by filing a motion to amend the complaint removing the claims listed by the city but also adding new claims,which was noted for four weeks after the close of the safe harbor period.strangely,the snellers still opposed the city motion for partial summary judgment related to the offending claims.the next day,the snellers propounded new discovery requests related to the same claims that were ostensibly withdrawn in the proposed amended complaint.
on august,the city again wrote to the snellers asking them to drop the frivolous and malicious claims against the city.in response,the snellers counsel asked the city to have something drawn up that he could discuss with the snellers.tired of waiting,the city provided a stipulation and order of dismissal,which was sent on august,indicating that if it was not signed and filed by noon on august,the city would file its rule motion.no response was received therefore,the city filed its motion for sanctions with the district court as promised.the district court granted the city motion for sanctions and awarded costs and attorney fees of to the city.
with this background in mind,i turn to the legal questions raised by the snellers appeal.
a n appellate court should apply an standard in reviewing all aspects of a district court rule determination.cooter gell hartmarx,emphasis added noting that distinguishing between legal and factual conclusions in the rule context is particularly difficult and concluding that a unitary abuse of discretion standard of review was therefore proper.a district court abuses its discretion when it applies the incorrect legal standard or its application of the correct legal standard was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.united states hinkson,cir quoting anderson city of bessemer city.
my colleagues craft the snellers argument on appeal far more cogently than was articulated by the snellers themselves.in fact,the successful argument on appeal is not found in the statement of the issue,and is only discussed in a single paragraph at the end of the opening brief.more importantly,the snellers never properly raised the question whether the filing of the rule motion was procedurally proper before the district court.therefore,the argument is waived,and we should not consider it on appeal.see united states childs,cir as a general rule,an issue not presented to the trial court can not be raised for the first time on appeal.quoting united states whitten,cir,abrogated on other grounds by united states perez,cir en banc.
my colleagues nonetheless conclude that the motion to amend was sufficient to notify the district court that the rule motion was essentially moot.op.at.however,the snellers never argued that the motion to amend the complaint rendered the city filing of the motion for sanctions with the court procedurally improper under rule c in fact,they acknowledged in their opposition to the motion for sanctions that not all of the city objections were remedied by the proposed amended complaint.
furthermore,the snellers invited the district court to rule on the rule motion on the merits in their proposed order denying sanctions,stating the motion and request for sanctions pursuant to.is ripe for determination and for an award of sanctions since the defendants have served their motion and waited the requisite days before filing this motion under the safe harbor provisions of rule.if ruling on the motion was procedurally improper as the majority now says,the motion was certainly not ripe for determination for an award of sanctions.thus,the snellers essentially invited any error that the district court might have made in granting the motion for sanctions.see perez,at stating that invited errors involving the relinquishment of a known right are unreviewable on appeal.
on the merits,the district court properly exercised its discretion in determining
