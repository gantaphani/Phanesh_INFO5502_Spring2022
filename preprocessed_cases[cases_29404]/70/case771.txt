iii.discussion 
defendant argues the trial court improperly imposed a restitution fine that included reimbursement to susan for the relocation costs she incurred in purchasing a new mobilehome.
procedural background 
at the time defendant entered his guilty pleas on january,the trial court,continued sentencing and ordered the probation department to prepare a report,including the amount of restitution due susan on march,the trial court requested documentation detailing the economic damages suffered by susan and continued the sentencing hearing.at the april,sentencing hearing,counsel stipulated to the fact that susan sold her mobilehome for and purchased a new mobilehome for.however,defense counsel objected to an award to susan of the difference between the sale and purchase prices of the two residences as part of the restitution order.susan testified she sold her mobilehome to the first available buyer because she wanted to leave the residence where she had been raped and her son threatened.susan stated there a ton of bad memories.i mean,i just ca live like that.susan acknowledged that she might have been able to sell her mobilehome for more money if she had waited and utilized the services of an agent.she further stated she bought a mobilehome of the same size in a gated community because that was all she could afford.a letter prepared by a los angeles county sheriff detective identified only as valentine revealed susan original mobilehome was incapable of being secured from intruders because of its shoddy construction.detective valentine described the flimsy construction of the trailer where susan was sexually assailed as follows,e ven if you secured the doors and windows,it would not take much effort to punch your way through the walls or shimmy the louver windows and gain access to the home.detective valentine further reported the victim is suffering emotional stress as a result of the assault.she is in constant fear of being assaulted again.she has made statements to the effect that she is unable to live a normal life and that she is in fear of her son safety.it is my opinion that the victim and her son would benefit from long term psychological therapy.the sexual assault occurred on may.defendant was not arrested until july.susan completed the purchase of her residence after defendant arrest.
restitution 
in,california voters amended the state constitution by way of initiative which established a new constitutional right for crime victims to obtain restitution for losses suffered as a result of a criminal act and directed the legislature to enact laws empowering the trial courts to issue such orders.article i,section,of the california constitution provides,b restitution.it is the unequivocal intention of the people of the state of california that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer.see also people broussard cal th,d,victim restitution is mandated by the california constitution people young th,d same.section,which implements the constitutional mandate,provides in pertinent part a it is the intent of the legislature that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that crime.f in every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant conduct,the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order,based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim i expenses incurred by an adult victim in relocating away from the defendant,including,but not limited to,deposits for utilities and telephone service,deposits for rental housing,temporary lodging and food expenses,clothing,and personal items.expenses incurred pursuant to this section shall be verified by law enforcement to be necessary for the personal safety of the victim or by a mental health treatment provider to be necessary for the emotional of the victim.this language controls the outcome of the present appeal.
