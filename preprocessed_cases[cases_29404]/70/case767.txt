insureds brought action against broker and employee.the superior court,city and county of san francisco,thomas mellon,denied defendants motion for sanctions.defendants appealed.the court of appeal,parrilli,held that the filing of the action after december,did not preclude sanctions under statute which authorizes sanctions for actions or tactics,including,but not limited to,the making or opposing of motions or the filing and service of a complaint or,only if the actions or tactics arise from a complaint filed,or a proceeding initiated,on or before december,and false answer to an interrogatory,even if the answer is a mistake,can qualify as an evasive response and a misuse of the discovery process within the meaning of statute permitting discovery sanctions for misuse of discovery process including an evasive response.
this case presents the question whether code of civil procedure section applies,after,to actions or tactics that do not involve pleadings,while code of civil procedure section governs pleading abuses we hold that the language of section and the example of federal sanctions law,on which the legislature modelled section,make it clear that the two statutes apply concurrently to different kinds of misconduct

background 
arthur gallagher company,an insurance broker,and its employee vicki sundgren collectively,gallagher appeal from orders denying their motions for an award of attorney fees.gallagher claimed that plaintiffs carleen olmstead and cherie rose engaged in a variety of sanctionable misconduct in their unsuccessful action to recover underinsured motorist benefits.on appeal,gallagher confines its arguments to three grounds for sanctions.
in its first motion,gallagher relied on sections and in an effort to recover of the approximately it had incurred in attorney fees.gallagher complained that plaintiffs had lied about the existence of a fax purportedly requesting personal automobile insurance coverage for olmstead.gallagher also claimed that plaintiffs had failed to produce any documents in response to its request for information on other insurance plaintiffs obtained after the accident,but then attempted to introduce evidence of such insurance at a late stage of the trial.in its reply memorandum,gallagher raised another point.in an interrogatory answer,olmstead had denied making any other claim for compensation for her injuries.at trial,rose and plaintiffs counsel had said the only other claim was one against the owner and driver of the car in which olmstead was a passenger when she was injured.however,just before filing its reply memorandum gallagher discovered that plaintiffs had a pending action against the department of transportation caltrans,in which they alleged that roadway design defect had caused the accident.the same attorneys representing plaintiffs in this case had filed the caltrans action the month before gallagher propounded its interrogatories.
the trial court denied this motion.it ruled that plaintiffs and their counsel may well have engaged in conduct sanctionable under section,but the statute did not apply because the action was filed after december.the court rejected gallagher argument that section applied to reprehensible conduct outside of pleadings,while section applied to pleading conduct.the court also ruled that gallagher could not recover sanctions under section because it had failed to comply with that statute safe harbor provision,subd.c.
gallagher moved for reconsideration,arguing that while it had belatedly discovered and raised the concealment of the caltrans lawsuit in its first motion,it had not had an opportunity to brief the issue of discovery sanctions under section.the court granted reconsideration but denied gallagher request for sanctions,ruling that a false but unequivocal denial did not qualify as an evasive response under section,subdivision a.
discussion 
sections and 
the legislature enacted section in as a response to bauguess paine cal d,in which the supreme court held that trial courts lack the power to impose sanctions in the form of attorney fees without statutory authorization.stats,ch,bauguess paine,supra,cal d at,commercial investors,firmaterr,th,d.section,subdivision a authorizes trial courts to award attorney fees incurred as a result of bad faith actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.in,the legislature decided to try a different approach to sanctions based on rule of the federal rules of civil procedure fed.rules civ,rule,hereafter,rule.to that end,the legislature enacted section.like rule,section makes sanctions,including an award of attorney fees,contingent on violation of the implied certification that pleadings and other papers filed with the court have factual and legal merit and are not being presented for an improper purpose.levy blum th,d barnes department of corrections th,d.

the provisions at issue in this case were enacted as part of the legislation.stats,ch.section,subdivision i states this section shall apply to a complaint or petition filed on or after january,and any other pleading,written notice of motion,or other similar paper filed in such a matter.section,subdivision b,defining the kind of conduct that may lead to sanctions,states actions or tactics include,but are not limited to,the making or opposing of motions or the filing and service of a complaint or only if the actions or tactics arise from a complaint filed,or a proceeding initiated,on or before december,
these provisions have been widely viewed,in dicta from the courts and in treatises,as establishing mutually exclusive sanctions regimes,with section controlling in proceedings initiated before january,and section controlling thereafter.see,garcia mccutchen cal th,fn,d,levy blum,supra,th,d bryan bank of america th,d commercial investors,firmaterr,supra,th at,d witkin,cal.procedure ed.trial,weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.this view was encouraged by the legislative counsel digest accompanying the chaptered legislation in,which stated that section sanctions were limited to proceedings initiated on or before december.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.see commercial investors,firmaterr,supra,th at,d.our supreme court also contributed to this interpretation by making an early comment that the sanctions legislation coming into effect in would suspend the operation of section substituting in its place a statute modelled on recently revised rule crowley katleman cal th,fn,d.
