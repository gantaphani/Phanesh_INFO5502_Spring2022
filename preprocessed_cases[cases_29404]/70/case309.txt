backgrounda.
keck garrett is an illinois corporation with its principal place of business in illinois.it markets communications and provides branding strategies for businesses.from to,it provided product packaging design and related services to nextel.nextel is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in reston,virginia.through its wholly owned subsidiaries,nextel provides fully integrated wireless communication services.
keck garrett dispute with nextel centers on the falcon project,a packaging initiative that nextel was planning for.in,keck garrett worked on nextel condor project,an industrial design and creative design project that supported nextel launch of a new platform of wireless devices developed by motorola.at that time,brian lausch was the nextel representative responsible for managing nextel relationship with keck garrett.at the press release for the condor project in late,lausch mentioned that keck garrett might be assigned to work on the falcon project in.
the falcon project was never assigned to keck garrett.nextel discussed the project with keck garrett in early january,and it to the company a confidential document entitled falcon packaging requirements.the document and the indicated that the industrial design plans were still uncertain and that nextel did not know the scope of its creative needs.
in,nextel informed keck garrett that another company was working with it on the industrial design aspects of the falcon project.it did,however,inform keck garrett that it still planned to assign the creative packaging work to keck garrett.several times,nextel told keck garrett that it planned to prepare a creative brief that would describe its creative needs.nextel indicated that,once it developed the creative brief,keck garrett would be able to determine the amount and type of work that would be required and to inform nextel of how much that work would cost.
in late january,lausch and his supervisor,jim obermeyer,held a conference call with representatives of keck garrett.they gave a powerpoint presentation during that meeting in order to keep keck garrett informed of nextel plan for its brand.nextel regularly kept its marketing partners on its branding strategies,even if nextel was not engaged with the partner in ongoing or upcoming projects.
on january,nextel issued a million blanket purchase order to keck garrett for that year anticipated packaging work.nextel issues written purchase orders to all agencies that work with it.these documents establish the terms and conditions of the relationship between nextel and each of its vendors.the blanket purchase orders generally do not describe any particular work or project instead,they set forth the terms and conditions that will govern any work that the vendor may be asked to complete in a given time period.nextel issues blanket purchase orders in part to expedite payment to vendors by eliminating the need to issue a separate purchase order each time an estimate for work is submitted.a blanket purchase order authorizes particular nextel representatives to assign work to a given vendor,up to the value of the blanket purchase order,without having to seek internal authorization for additional purchase order numbers.even with a blanket purchase order,however,the vendor had to send in an estimate for approval the blanket purchase order only eliminated the need for a separately authorized purchase order for each estimate.
nextel often issued blanket purchase orders to keck garrett over their years of work together.keck garrett understood that nextel would pay only for work that it had approved on the basis of a signed estimate.keck garrett therefore usually began work only after nextel approved an estimate of the costs.if keck garrett was in the middle of an assigned project for nextel and it was determined that the project would exceed the approved estimate,however,keck garrett sometimes continued to work on the project even if it had not yet received a signed approval from lausch.nextel generally refused to move back deadlines for any reason in this way,keck garrett was able to complete nextel projects on time,although at the risk of not receiving approval for the expanded project.
vicki hall,a financial analyst at nextel,forwarded the blanket purchase order to keck garrett by to inform keck garrett of its purchase order number for that year.the blanket purchase order stated that it was a blanket order for phone accessory and listed hall and lausch as the persons authorized to release funds.the delivery date for blanket order for phone accessory packaging,the same type of work that keck garrett had done for nextel in the past,was december.the blanket purchase order also included the terms and conditions to govern their relationship.
keck garrett and nextel agree that the blanket purchase order is an integrated contract that is governed by and subject to delaware law.the parties further agree that,under the blanket purchase order,the supplier must pay nextel costs and reasonable attorneys fees if nextel defends any action brought by a supplier and prevails.
among other incorporated terms and conditions in the blanket purchase order is a provision governing payments and invoices.the provision states that the supplier shall be paid upon the submission of proper invoices or vouchers,the prices stipulated herein for work completed articles delivered and accepted,less any proper deductions or setoffs.at.the provision further requires that invoices include the purchase order number,item number,description of articles or work,sizes,quantities,unit prices,and extended totals.id.the blanket purchase order also permits nextel to make changes in writing to the general scope of the blanket purchase order,including changes to the description,time and performance of services.
shortly after the blanket purchase order was issued,keck garrett submitted to nextel invoices totaling.the invoices used the purchase order number on the blanket purchase order.the invoices were not for falcon project work,but for work that had been assigned under the condor project.nextel paid the invoices.
in the months after the blanket purchase order was issued,keck garrett and nextel exchanged a series of about the falcon project.nextel several documents to keck garrett,including the packaging concept timeline for the falcon project and potential packaging structures that nextel was considering.if nextel had assigned the creative design project to keck garrett,keck garrett would have been placing its creative design on these packages.some of the information was highly confidential.the also clearly stated,however,that the creative requirements for the falcon project were still to be determined.the creative design,the scope of which was still uncertain,was the aspect that keck garrett expected to complete.
in late february,keck garrett lausch about the progress of the packaging structure.keck garrett also asked when it might need to start concepting the designs.keck garrett indicated that the company was trying to plan in advance for scheduling purposes.nextel stated again that it was planning to prepare a formal creative brief for the falcon project in the following weeks,but it had not yet done so.
in,lausch keck garrett to let it know that the creative brief was nearly complete and that he hoped to share it with keck garrett during the first week of april.keck garrett responded that it would get started on the falcon project as soon as it received the creative brief.not having received the brief,keck garrett sent another as late as may asking when nextel would release the falcon project so that keck garrett could get started.
on may,nextel informed keck garrett that it would not need keck garrett creative packaging work on the falcon project.nextel had been in the process of vetting new advertising agencies,and the agency it just had hired had offered to perform the packaging work at no additional cost.nextel did not refrain from assigning work to keck garrett over performance issues the decision was motivated purely by competitive business interests.nextel never assigned the falcon project to keck garrett.keck garrett never received a written change order under the blanket purchase order after it was informed that it would not be assigned the falcon project.
keck garrett asked nextel to reconsider its decision.nextel confirmed that it would not reconsider,and it offered to pay any of keck garrett outstanding invoices.keck garrett then billed nextel for.the invoice,dated august,was for preliminary falcon project packaging and design research.the invoice did not seek recompense for work assigned to keck garrett by nextel.rather,it included salaries for people waiting for the falcon project and some amount for the insult of the termination.
after receipt of the invoice,nextel asked keck garrett to supply documentation to support its charges.on september,keck garrett sent nextel the following internal documents in response the powerpoint presentation nextel had sent keck garrett a few undated internal keck garrett memoranda printouts of between keck garrett and nextel and other general materials,including newspaper articles and publications produced by third parties regarding color and shape.nextel reviewed the materials and,on january,it sent keck garrett a letter denying payment.the letter stated 
this body of work does not provide,nor do we feel it would have provided,any valuable or actionable findings,take aways or insights relative to the falcon packaging project.again,nextel marketing communication did not any preliminary competitive research,design or design research and we were very clear throughout our communications in the first half of that the scope of our creative requirements was uncertain.
keck garrett acknowledges that nextel did not specifically ask it to perform any preliminary work.
in november,nextel again asked whether keck garrett had any outstanding invoices.a month later,keck garrett again requested payment of the invoice plus interest.keck garrett further stated that,if it did not receive the payment,it would pursue legal action.in may,months after it had filed this suit against nextel,keck garrett sent nextel a million invoice that referenced the blanket purchase order.
keck garrett sought recovery against nextel on two theories.characterizing nextel action as a breach of contract,keck garrett sought million,an amount that it characterizes as the value of the blanket purchase order.keck garrett also sought payment on the invoice under the contract.alternately,keck garrett sought recovery in quantum meruit.
after discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment.nextel and keck garrett stipulated that the blanket purchase order is a fully integrated contract subject to delaware law.nextel motion requested summary judgment on both the breach of contract claim and the quantum meruit claim.nextel also maintained that,if the court granted its motion for summary judgment,it was entitled to costs and reasonable attorneys fees under the terms of the blanket purchase order.
in reply to nextel motion for summary judgment,keck garrett responded only to the breach of contract arguments it contended that nextel had repudiated the contract when it gave its advertising work to another company.in its own brief in support of its motion for summary judgment,keck garrett submitted that nextel breached the blanket purchase order when it assigned keck garrett packaging work to another company.
in evaluating the parties positions,the district court first noted that neither keck garrett motion for summary judgment nor its response to nextel motion for summary judgment addressed the quantum meruit claim.it determined,therefore,that keck garrett had abandoned that claim.
second,the court concluded that nextel had no obligation to pay the invoice.the blanket purchase order explicitly stated that nextel would pay upon keck garrett submission of proper invoices or vouchers,the prices stipulated herein for work completed articles delivered and accepted,less any proper deductions or setoffs.at.the court concluded that this provision required keck garrett to submit an invoice for work completed,delivered to and accepted by nextel.the court concluded that,even read broadly,work completed did not include work that was not requested by nextel and was of no value to it 
finally,the court determined that nextel did not breach the blanket purchase order when it decided not to assign to keck garrett any work on the falcon project.the court concluded that the blanket purchase order did not guarantee that nextel would assign any amount of work to keck garrett.the court considered and rejected four sets of reasons,propounded by keck garrett,why it was entitled to recover from nextel the contract terms an alleged oral agreement that predated the blanket purchase order blanket purchase orders that nextel had issued to keck garrett before and the argument that the contract,if found not to have been breached,was illusory.
the district court then granted nextel motion for summary judgment and denied keck garrett motion.keck garrett timely appealed.
during the pendency of this appeal,keck garrett filed a motion in the district court for sanctions against nextel.keck garrett and nextel had participated in a circuit rule settlement conference.thereafter,during a proceeding regarding attorneys fees before the district court,nextel disclosed information that it allegedly had obtained during the settlement conference.keck garrett requested that the district court impose rule sanctions against nextel for violating the confidentiality requirements of the rule settlement conference.
keck garrett also filed a motion for sanctions in this court.that motion incorporated the motion to the district court.keck garrett specifically requested that,as a sanction,we strike nextel motion for attorneys fees that was then pending before the district court.
discussion 
the general principles that guide our review of a case coming to us on summary judgment are.we review de novo a district court decision on a motion for summary judgment and construe all facts in favor of the party.cherry auburn gear,cir.on for summary judgment,the court construes facts and draws inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion under consideration is made.in re united air lines,cir citation omitted.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also in re united air lines,at.
contract interpretation is a matter of law.cherry,at.if a contract is not ambiguous and does not require the court to look to extrinsic evidence,there are no factual disputes to preclude summary judgment.see id.however,summary judgment is not warranted when there are genuine issues of material fact with respect to interpretation of a contract.id.
the invoice 
keck garrett first submits that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment for nextel on the issue of whether it should pay the invoice.in resolving this issue,the district court made three factual determinations,each of which is supported by the record that nextel did not assign any work to keck garrett,that keck garrett did not complete any properly assigned work and that the work it had submitted was of no value to nextel.the district court also correctly determin
