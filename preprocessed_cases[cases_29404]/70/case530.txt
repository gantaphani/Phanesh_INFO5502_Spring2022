in,tina garcia filed this action against her insurer,seeking payment of benefits under a disability policy.over the course of the litigation,the district court concluded that garcia willfully,knowingly,and intentionally fabricated a number of discovery documents in an effort to win her case.mag.dist.as a result,in addition to granting berkshire motion for summary judgment on the merits,the district court separately and independently dismissed the action as a sanction for garcia abusive litigation practices.because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing garcia action as a sanction for her improper actions,we affirm its judgment without reaching the merits of her claims.
background 
in,garcia purchased a disability policy from berkshire,under which she would receive benefits if due to injury or sickness she was unable to perform the material and substantial duties of her own occupation,and she was not engaged in any occupation in which she might reasonably be expected to engage with due regard for her education,training,experience,and prior economic status.aple.
at the time that she purchased the policy,garcia was the ceo of a real estate company called special properties,spi,which held a contract with the united states department of housing and urban development hud.in,hud undertook a criminal investigation of spi and terminated its contract after finding billing irregularities and fraudulent invoices.the following year,spi sued hud in a matter ultimately dismissed without prejudice by stipulation of both parties.
at around this time,garcia first filed for benefits under her policy,claiming that she was suffering from stress disorder and a chronic sleep disorder.she later argued that her disability was aggravated by two subsequent developments.first,the psychiatrist treating garcia admitted to having sex with her.second,garcia suffered multiple injuries from a motor vehicle collision in september.this accident allegedly resulted in cognitive impairment.
berkshire eventually paid full benefits on garcia claim through august,under a reservation of rights until its investigation of her claim could be completed.as of that date,however,berkshire suspended payment of benefits,contending that garcia had failed to comply with certain provisions of her policy requiring her to establish proof of her loss.see aple.although berkshire ultimately approved garcia claim for total disability benefits as of february,it refused to pay benefits for the period between august and february,primarily because of garcia alleged failure to comply with critical policy provisions.amongst other deficiencies,berkshire claimed that garcia had failed to submit to an independent medical examination until,and withheld the authorization berkshire required in order to get access to her medical records.see id.at.
these omissions were important because berkshire questioned the legitimacy of garcia disability claim before.in particular,it noted that during the period before in which garcia had claimed to be totally disabled due to cognitive defects,garcia had obtained a juris doctor degree from the university of denver college of law,where she was named an outstanding law graduate,and subsequently completed a masters program.moreover,berkshire noted that it appeared that garcia had operated a real estate business during,three years after the time she had first claimed total disability.berkshire concluded that because of garcia alleged failure to comply with berkshire requests for an independent medical examination and access to medical records during the period,it could not meaningfully evaluate whether garcia had been totally disabled within the meaning of the policy during that time.
after the dispute proceeded to litigation,both sides filed motions for summary judgment on the merits.in addition,berkshire later filed a motion for sanctions,asserting that garcia falsified or fabricated at least four documents submitted during discovery.the magistrate judge held a hearing on berkshire motion for sanctions on november,at which garcia testified concerning each of the allegedly fabricated documents.the magistrate judge found garcia testimony at the sanctions hearing to be incredible,and refuse d to rely on any of it.id.at.see also mag.stating that plaintiff willingness to lie knows no bounds.the magistrate judge concluded that garcia prepared fabricated evidence willfully,knowingly,intentionally,after careful contemplation,for purposes,and with a full understanding of the impropriety involved.id.at.
the magistrate judge noted that at least two of the falsified documents were directly related to garcia claims.first,garcia submitted a letter,purportedly written by earl schoenborn,a former berkshire claims adjuster,that appeared to be a smoking gun in support of her claims.in the letter,schoenborn is alleged to have written 
i left berkshire after berkshire refused to honor disability claims of several female policy holders.i was distressed and told garcia so,to witness berkshire denial of legitimate claims of disabled and dying women clients.
i can testify based on personal knowledge that berkshire used unfair business practices contrary to policy provisions in order to delay or deny payment of valid claims.berkshire tactics include stall and starve,delay pay on the courthouse steps and manipulate claimant attorney to advocate taking a settlement paying back benefit and lawyers without recovery for the financial damages.
id.at.the letter went on to suggest that schoenborn had contacted a current berkshire employee and learned that berkshire only defense was not a real defense under the policy.id.at.but schoenborn repudiated the letter in full,stating that he a bsolutely,completely,definitively,totally did not write that letter,and that the letter contains false statements that he did not agree with and which should not be attributable to him.id.at.
likewise,the magistrate judge found that garcia fabricated a document allegedly prepared by patrick renfro,garcia vocational rehabilitation expert,and submitted to the colorado board of law examiners cble in support of garcia application for special accommodation double time when taking the bar exam.while renfro actual report described garcia symptoms as occurring secondary to a mild to moderate head injury or a syndrome as well as stress,depression,chronic pain,and possible iatrogenic medication effects,the report garcia submitted to cble and the district court omitted the italicized her head injury appear more severe and minimizing the extent to which depression caused garcia symptoms.vol.iv,doc,at.in addition,the submitted report was doctored to explicitly suggest that garcia required double time for her bar exam when renfro had made no such recommendation.he too repudiated the report attributed to him,testifying that he had absolutely no knowledge of this report in any way,shape,or form.mag.op.at.
the magistrate judge also found that garcia forged two additional documents a letter by robert kooken,garcia neuropsychologist,in which he had supposedly indicated that it was medically necessary that she be treated by another psychiatrist and an email string purportedly between garcia and gene lupia,a former professional colleague,which garcia submitted to the magistrate judge when attempting to justify why attorney fees should not be assessed against her.although the magistrate judge recognized that these latter two fabrications were less directly relevant to garcia claims at trial,he noted that they still bore on garcia credibility and raised substantial doubt as to the authenticity of any document relating to this case.id.at.
the magistrate judge ultimately concluded that this was an especially egregious case,finding that t he fabrications were prepared over a period of years and are calculating,carefully constructed,and.id.at.he recommended that berkshire motion for sanctions be granted and that garcia claims be dismissed with prejudice.id.at.the district court conclude d that the magistrate judge recommendation is correct in all respects.dist.upon de novo review of the record,it agreed that the magistrate judge findings of fact were,at minimum,supported by clear and convincing evidence.id.at.as a result,the court granted berkshire motion for sanctions.separately,the district court granted berkshire motion for summary judgment on the merits,largely premised on the conclusion that garcia did not comply with the proof of loss requirements in her policy,and that therefore berkshire did not breach the insurance policy as a matter of law.id.at.garcia appealed.
ii.the district court dismissal of garcia claim as a sanction 
a district court has inherent equitable powers to impose the sanction of dismissal with prejudice because of abusive litigation practices during discovery.see televideo,heidenthal,cir archibeque atchison,topeka santa fe ry,cir.b a.because of the harshness of dismissal,however,due process requires that the violation be predicated upon willfulness,bad faith,or some fault of petitioner rather than inability to comply.archibeque,at internal quotation omitted.while recognizing that there is no rigid test for determining when such a sanction is appropriate,we have suggested that a district court ought to evaluate five factors before imposing a dismissal sanction the degree of actual prejudice to the defendant the amount of interference with the judicial process the culpability of the litigant whether the court warned the party in advance that dismissal of the action would be a likely sanction for and the efficacy of lesser sanctions.see ehrenhaus reynolds,cir.we review a district court decision to impose such a sanction for abuse of discretion.see archibeque,at.
the district court concluded that almost all of these factors counseled in favor of the sanction of dismissal with prejudice the court first determined that the prejudice to berkshire was overwhelming because it had been forced to defend a lawsuit pervaded by false evidence.as the court noted,t he defendants have been put to enormous additional effort and expense to ferret out plaintiff lies and to double check every piece of information.mag.the court further concluded that it had absolutely no confidence that garcia would not attempt to offer additional false evidence at a trial.id.
the court next found that garcia had interfered egregiously with the court administration of justice and that garcia was culpable for the fabrications.see id.at.specifically,the court determined that garcia acted willfully,knowingly,intentionally,after careful contemplation,for purposes,and with a full understanding of the impropriety involved.id.at.although the court acknowledged that it had not warned garcia of the possible sanction of dismissal,it nevertheless concluded that garcia misconduct required that imposition of a monetary sanction,exclusion of falsified evidence,and exclusion of testimony would have been insufficient to deter those who would manufacture evidence and attempt to cover it up.id.at.
in her appellate briefs,garcia contended that the district court erred in concluding that she was clearly and convincingly culpable as to the claimed fabrications.aplt.br.accordingly,this court devoted significant time prior to oral argument to an examination of the factual record.at oral argument,however,garcia counsel abruptly abandoned any attempt to contest the factual findings regarding culpability,indicating that garcia was not going to challenge the trial court findings that those documents were fabricated.while we appreciate counsel candor during oral argument,we regard this switch in position as unfortunately typical of garcia behavior throughout this case.garcia seems inclined to raise factual smoke screens only to assert,after the facts are revealed,that the truth of the matter was irrelevant.
having closely examined the arguments of the parties,we can not find that the district court has abused its discretion by concluding that the severe sanction of dismissal was warranted.the submission of falsified evidence substantially prejudices an opposing party by casting doubt on the veracity of all of the culpable party submissions throughout litigation.the prejudiced party is forced either to attempt independent corroboration of each submission,at substantial expense of time and money,or to accept the real possibility that those discovery documents submitted by the opposing party are inaccurate.nor is the exclusion of the fabricated evidence always enough to deter discovery misconduct.litigants would infer that they have everything to gain,and nothing to lose,if manufactured evidence merely is excluded while their lawsuit continues.pope federal express.
although garcia did not receive an explicit warning that dismissal would be a likely sanction for fabricating evidence,this is not a prerequisite to the imposition of dismissal sanctions.see,archibeque,at upholding dismissal even though no warning given.in addition,we have noted that where false answers are given under oath,as was the case with the responses to interrogatories here,see.b,additional warnings are superfluous at best.chavez city of albuquerque,cir.once a witness swears to give truthful answers,there is no requirement to warn him not to commit perjury or,conversely to direct him to tell the truth.it would render the sanctity of the oath quite meaningless to require admonition to adhere to it.id.citation omitted.
we have previously authorized the imposition of dismissal sanctions in cases involving discovery violations arguably less egregious than this one.in ehrenhaus,for instance,the district court dismissed ehrenhaus case for failure to appear at a scheduled deposition,when ehrenhaus had asserted that it was essential that the deposition be delayed so that he could attend a business meeting in new york in order to save his business from bankruptcy.at.in that case,there was no suggestion that the party against whom the sanction was imposed had intentionally submitted false evidence or deceived the court.nevertheless,we upheld the sanction.
the facts ofarchibeque are closer to this case.in archibeque,archibeque sought damages from a railway company for personal injuries allegedly sustained while working for the company.in her responses to discovery questions seeking her complete medical records,archibeque withheld information about prior injuries that would have weakened her claim for damages.archibeque,at.although she denied any intent to conceal her prior injuries,and explained her failure to provide the records as a mere oversight,the district court granted the railway company motion for dismissal as a sanction.id.at.we again affirmed.if the omission of discovery evidence was sufficient to justify the sanction of dismissal in archibeque,it seems clear that the affirmative fabrication of evidence is likewise sufficient to justify dismissal here.
ample evidence supported the conclusion that garcia was herself culpable for the fabrications submitted in this case.numerous inauthentic documents were submitted over a several year period,counseling against an explanation of mistake.moreover,the fabrications were carefully constructed to look like authentic documents.letters were made to look as though they were printed on authentic letterhead emails were carefully spliced together so as to appear accurate fax banners were added to documents to disguise their origin.see mag.see also aple.br.finally,garcia evasive,inconsistent answers and inability to provide an explanation for the fabrications during the hearing cast further doubt on her accounting of events.see,mag.we give the district court determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses great deference.wessel city of albuquerque,cir.accordingly,the district court was well within its discretion to determine that the evidence clearly and convincingly supported the conclusion that garcia intentionally fabricated the documents.
garcia,however,attempts to argue that a dismissal sanction here is inappropriate for a variety of reasons.garcia first argues that even if the documents were fabrications,they can not provide a basis for a dismissal sanction,because they had absolutely no materiality or relevance to the substantive issues of this case.aplt.br.as an initial
