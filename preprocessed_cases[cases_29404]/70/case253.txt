this case involves allegations of anticompetitive behavior in the market for burial monuments in the state of michigan.three independent monument builders and a nonprofit trade association of monument michigan division of the monument builders of north america collectively,the builders filed the present lawsuit against cemetery operators and the michigan cemetery association collectively,the cemeteries.the lawsuit alleges that the cemeteries are engaged in an illegal tying arrangement,in violation of of the sherman act,an illegal conspiracy to restrain competition and monopolize trade,also in violation of of the sherman act,an illegal conspiracy to restrain trade,in violation of of the sherman act,and violations of the michigan prepaid funeral and cemetery sales act.
the district court dismissed the builders claims after concluding that the proposed geographic market as set forth in the complaint was too narrow as a matter of law.subsequently,the district court denied motions for sanctions against the builders that were filed by several of the cemetery operators.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court on the merits of the antitrust claims,but vacate its denial of sanctions and remand the case for further proceedings on that issue.
background 
factual background 
the builders allege that the cemeteries have been engaging in a continuing unlawful combination and conspiracy to unreasonably restrain trade and engage in unlawful tying arrangements in cemeteries in the sale and installation of memorials and monuments and related items.according to the builders second amended complaint the complaint,the cemeteries employ various tactics to prevent the independent monument builders from competing in the market.these tactics form the basis of the alleged sherman act violations.three independent monument builders have brought claims on their own behalf against the named defendants only,while the monument builders trade association seeks relief on behalf of a class of all monument builders in michigan against a defendant class comprised of all cemeteries in the state that engage in one or more practices that restrict free trade for monuments.monetary damages are sought by the independent builders and injunctive relief is sought by the trade association.the builders collective claims are identical,however,with respect to all of the legal and factual issues.
the cemeteries are individually identified in paragraph of the complaint,but the complaint contains no specific allegations of wrongdoing by the individual cemeteries.instead,the complaint alleges generally that each of the defendants,and each member of the defendant class,has engaged in all or certain of the following anticompetitive actions and activities.the builders then assert four claims against the cemeteries,although each claim is presented twice,once as a claim by the three independent builders counts i through iv and once as a claim by the trade association counts v through viii.the relevant geographic market for all four claims is defined in the complaint as each individual cemetery in the state of michigan.each cemetery is its own market,according to the builders,b ecause of the uniqueness of land and the fact that once a grave is purchased,the owner or his or her family who wish to memorialize the deceased must install the memorial or monument in that cemetery.
count i and count v allege an illegal tying arrangement in violation of section of the sherman act.specifically,the builders allege that the cemeteries have sufficient economic power in the tying cemetery burial impose restrictions in the tied product or service,monuments and memorials and related products and installation of monuments and memorials and related products and a substantial volume of commerce in said market was in fact restrained.
in count ii and count vi,the builders allege that the cemeteries are engaged in an illegal conspiracy to restrain competition and monopolize trade,also in violation of section of the sherman act.the alleged conspiracy is designed to drive plaintiffs out of business by engaging in the predatory practices set forth in paragraph,in particular,by exclusion of plaintiffs from defendant cemeteries and by price fixing,thereby impeding plaintiffs ability to sell or install monuments,memorials,foundations,benches,mausoleums,and other related items for the memorialization of the dead.according to the builders,this conspiracy is part of a historical practice by cemeteries to eliminate competition by adopting practices that violate the antitrust laws.the builders explain that t his avowed position to pursue illegal practices in violation of antitrust laws was articulated by shackelfold,past president of the american cemetery association,in his speech in february,in san antonio,texas.in that speech,shackelfold said 
the cemeterian is not going to give up the installation rule until he is told to do so by the supreme court that he has to.if it reaches that point,you and i are going to have a lot more problems than we have now.cemeteries will figure out other ways to collect these charges through maintenance,supervision and bookkeeping charges.
the complaint makes no allegation,however,that shackelfold is involved in the present litigation.
according to the builders,h aving secured the agreement from major private cemeteries that sell monuments and memorials,defendants,individually and through the aegis of the michigan cemetery association,have attempted to bring smaller cemeteries into the conspiracy.the attempts to bring in smaller cemeteries are allegedly demonstrated by a letter from leonard krawczyk,president of hillcrest memorial gardens and a director of the michigan cemetery association,that was sent to jeff davis of great lakes monument in december of.a copy of the letter is attached to the complaint as exhibit.the letter discusses a dispute between hillcrest and great lakes regarding the costs associated with placing two monuments in hillcrest cemetery.in addition to being sent to davis at great lakes,the letter was sent to the shiawassee county prosecutor,suzanne jolicour of the state cemetery commission,and a number of other cemeteries and monument builders.
count iii and count vii alleges a conspiracy to restrain trade attempt to monopolize in violation of section of the sherman act.the builders allege that because of their proposed geographic each individual cemetery being a market unto cemeteries have sufficient market power to come dangerously close to monopolizing the defined market in burial memorials and monuments.
finally,in count iv and count viii,the builders allege a number of violations of the michigan prepaid funeral and cemetery sales act.among the alleged violations is a failure to comply with price disclosure rules.
procedural background 
the builders filed their initial complaint in december of.in january of,and again in august of,the builders were allowed to amend their complaint.most of the cemeteries then filed a joint motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the others filed their own separate motions to dismiss.
finding that the builders proposed geographic market was inadequate as a matter of law,the district court granted the cemeteries motions to dismiss the federal antitrust claims in october of.the court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the builders claims,thereby dismissing them without prejudice.a timely appeal was filed by the builders,with the issues limited to the federal antitrust claims.
meanwhile,four of the individual cemeteries filed motions for sanctions against the builders pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,and the court inherent authority.the district court denied the motions without explanation.that decision has been by the individual cemeteries seeking the sanctions.

in the antitrust context,the supreme court has noted that although district courts must be cautious before dismissing an antitrust complaint in advance of discovery,they must not forget that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive.bell.at.it specifically commented that a district court must retain the power to insist on some specificity in pleading before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed.id.at quoting associated contractors of,carpenters,d.
b.the tying claim and the relevant market 
the builders allege that the cemeteries are using improper tying arrangements to require consumers to purchase a burial memorial from the cemeteries once they have purchased a burial plot.these allegedly improper sales practices form the basis for all three of the builders claims arising under the sherman act.in granting the cemeteries motions to dismiss,the district court concluded that the builders antitrust claims fail because the geographic market,as proposed by the builders,was too narrow as a matter of law.on appeal,the builders argue that the district court erred in granting the motions to dismiss on the basis of alleged infirmities in the proposed geographic market.the builders claim that they have satisfied the pleading requirements of the federal rules of civil procedure and are entitled to proceed to discovery in an attempt to prove that the geographic market they have proposed is sufficient to sustain an antitrust action.
a tying arrangement is defined as an agreement by a party to sell one product only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different or tied product,or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier.pac.ry.united states,d.in other words,a supermarket that will sell flour to consumers only if they will also buy sugar is engaged in tying.flour is referred to as the tying product,sugar as the tied product.jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,d,concurring emphasis in original.the typical tying case involve s a seller attempt to exploit its economic power over one product or in one market to force a less desirable,tied product on a buyer.highland capital,franklin nat.bank,cir.illegal tying therefore occurs only if the seller has appreciable economic power in the tying product market and if the arrangement affects a substantial volume of commerce in the tied market.psi repair,honeywell,cir quoting eastman kodak image technical,d.
a ny inquiry into the validity of a tying arrangement must focus on the market or markets in which the two products are sold,for that is where the anticompetitive forcing has its impact.jefferson parish,at.requiring proof of market power regarding the tying product is important because,without market power,a seller can not engage in the forcing necessary to establish a violation.psi,at.even though market power is normally established by controlling a substantial share of the market,market power also exists when the seller offers a unique product that competitors are not able to offer.id.at quoting jefferson parish,at.
the idea that all land is unique,however,is insufficient to support a finding of market power.in northern pacific,the supreme court concluded that specific real estate holdings were sufficient to give the defendant market power because the land was strategically located in checkerboard fashion amid private holdings and within economic distance of transportation facilities t his particular land was often prized by those who purchased or leased it and was frequently essential to their business activities.at.
the holding of northern pacific has been interpreted to mean that uniqueness of location is not in itself adequate to establish market power there must be other evidence showing that the location lends the defendant a competitive advantage others can not meet.monuments,am.cemetery ass n,cir.in a more recent case relevant to whether uniqueness alone is sufficient to presume market power,the supreme court reiterated that in all cases involving a tying arrangement,the plaintiff must prove that the defendant has market power in the tying product.tool works indep.ink,d abrogating the presumption that the simple possession of a patent automatically conferred market power upon the patentee.
in addition to defining the relevant product market and demonstrating the defendant power in that market,the plaintiff in an antitrust case must also define the relevant geographic market and demonstrate that the defendant actions produced anticompetitive effects in that defined area.found.for interior design educ.research savannah coll.of art design,cir.the selected geographic market must both correspond to the commercial realities of the industry and be economically significant.brown shoe united states,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.what this usually boils down to in practice is the area of actual or potential competition between the parties involved in the case.city of cleveland cleveland illuminating,cir.
the geographic market includes the geographic area in which consumers can practically seek alternative sources of the product,and it can be defined as the market area in which the seller operates.double d spotting,supervalu,cir quoting tampa nashville coal,d.as we have previously noted,m arket definition is a highly analysis that generally requires discovery.found.for interior design,at.but the fact that market definition generally requires discovery has not prevented this court,and others,from affirming grants of motions to dismiss on the basis of an insufficiently pled or totally unsupportable proposed market.
in double d,for example,the plaintiff alleged that the defendants engaged in anticompetitive behavior by requiring truck drivers to use a certain unloading service at a specified storage facility.based on the plaintiff complaint,the product market is defined as unloading services and the geographic market is alleged to be the supervalu warehouse in urbandale,iowa,which is a suburb of des moines.at.the district court,in dismissing the plaintiff complaint,concluded that the proposed geographic market was too narrow as a matter of law.in affirming the dismissal of the plaintiff claim,the eighth circuit explained its rationale as follows 
at issue is one contract between the owner of one particular warehouse within the des moines metropolitan area and one unloading service provider.the contract provides that this one unloading service provider has the right,subject to an agreed upon price schedule,to provide all of the unloading services at this particular warehouse.supervalu one warehouse in urbandale does not amount to a relevant market for unloading services of this type.rather,the market for unloading services would seem to be more properly defined as including all warehouses within,at least,the entire des moines,iowa,metropolitan area,if not an even larger area.
the fifth circuit similarly affirmed a rule b dismissal on the basis of an inadequate geographic market in apani,enterprises,cir.in apani,the plaintiff alleged that had illegally conspired with the city of lubbock,texas to obtain an exclusive contract to supply all nonalcoholic beverages to facilities owned by the city.apani contended that the relevant geographic market consisted of only the facilities owned by the city.id.at.in affirming the dismissal of apani claims,the fifth circuit concluded that the alleged geographic market did not correspond to the commercial realities of the industry and was not economically significant.id.at.the court explained that apani has simply attempted to artificially narrow a broader economic market,the city of lubbock,to specific venues.such pleading maneuvers may not be used for the purpose of creating a fictitious market.id.
the district court below relied heavily on foundation for interior design,a case from this circuit.although that case did not involve an insufficient geographic market per se,we affirmed a rule b dismissal because of an inadequate definition.the defendant antitrust counterclaims in foundation for interior design were premised on the allegation that the plaintiff abused its market power in the market for accredited interior design programs by restricting output and suppressing competition.id.at.we affirmed the dismissal of the counterclaims because the defendant competes with schools that have interior design programs and with schools that have accredited programs.thus,the relevant market in this case includes all interior design programs.id.
the builders define the tied product market as granite and bronze grave monuments,memorials,foundations,benches,mausoleums,and related items for memorialization of the dead,and the installation of the same.with respect to the tying product,the burial lots,and the geographic market,the builders position is as follows 
because of the uniqueness of land and the fact that once a grave is purchased the owner or his or her family who wish to memorialize the deceased must install the memorial or monument in that cemetery,each cemetery constitutes a unique and separate market.therefore,the relevant geographic market is each individual cemetery in the state of michigan.
the builders further contend that a cemetery lot,being real estate,is unique,and cemeteries are distinct enterprises and have a unique public function.
but the builders argument ignores the fact that each individual cemetery has nothing close to exclusive control over burial lots outside of the four corners of its own land.moreover,the uniqueness of land is insufficient to serve as support for defining a geographic market absent a showing of competitive advantage on the basis of the land particular characteristics.monuments,am.cemetery ass n,cir concluding that although cemetery lots are unique,as all land is unique,the plaintiffs had failed to show that the uniqueness provided them with a competitive advantage.counsel for the builders in fact acknowledged during the district court hearing on the cemeteries motion to dismiss that of itself,the uniqueness of land does not make for a tying case.it did at one time.it does not anymore.
furthermore,the acceptance of the builders proposed geographic market would make any proof of market power unnecessary.there can be no competition for the sale of burial lots within a market that contains only one provider of burial lots.market power under these circumstances would be unavoidable.the builders appear to acknowledge this aspect of their argument when they state that there are no real substitutes for the tying product,interment rights within a particular cemetery.they in essence are urging us to merge the analysis and the analysis into one determination,rendering one or the other unnecessary.
in a final attempt to explain their argument,the builders state in their reply brief that competition between cemeteries for the sale of interment rights is not relevant to the market issues in this case.with respect to the tying market,plaintiffs rely upon the uniqueness of the tying product,not market share,to establish the requisite power.but this argument seems to contradict their previously cited arguments,based on each cemetery exclusive control over its own interment rights.moreover,the only allegations of uniqueness in the complaint are the uniqueness of land,the fact that after a grave is purchased,the purchaser must place the memorial in that cemetery,and that cemeteries are distinct enterprises and have a unique public function.
the builders have acknowledged,however,that the uniqueness of land is insufficient by itself to support the builders proposed market.focusing on what happens only after a grave site is purchased also ignores the competitive market for the initial sale of burial lots.and finally,the fact that cemeteries have a unique public function is a comment on the general role of cemeteries in society,but does not support the conclusion that each individual cemetery in michigan is in some way unique from every other cemetery in a way that can be recognized by the antitrust laws.
moreover,even if we were to accept the truth of all of the builders claims,we would still find that their prosed geographic market is too narrow as a matter of law.we have no doubt that the market for burial plots is heavily influenced by personal preferences religious,geographic,and familial,but to conclude as a result of such personal preferences that each individual cemetery is its own geographic market removes any chance of defining a geographic market that correspond s to the commercial realities of the industry.see brown shoe united states,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the builders also assert that the district court incorrectly limited the analysis to a question of market share,thereby avoiding the supreme court recognition that market power may exist when the seller offers a unique product that competitors are not able to offer.jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,d.but the complaint,even when its factual allegations are taken as true,does not support a conclusion that each of the individual cemeteries in the state of michigan truly offers a unique product that can not be realistically offered by one or more of the other cemeteries.moreover,the cases cited by the builders in support of their argument that the uniqueness factor requires a market defined as each individual cemetery make clear that uniqueness,in the antitrust context,serves as an alternative method for proving product market share,not as a method of defining a geographic market.see see also pac.ry.united states,d concluding that specific real estate holdings were sufficient to give the defendant market power because the land was strategically located in checkerboard fashion amid private holdings and within economic distance of transportation facilities t his particular land was often prized by those who purchased or leased it and was frequently essential to their business activities.
the cases that both parties cite regarding antitrust claims against cemeteries support the conclusion that the builders proposed geographic market is deficient as a matter of law.in each case,the plaintiffs identified an economically realistic geographic market,and any discussion of uniqueness was in the context of determining product market share,not the relevant geographic market.for example,in monument builders of greater kansas city,american cemetery association of kansas,cir,the plaintiffs alleged that approximately of interments each year in the kansas city area take place in the defendants cemeteries.the geographic market was the kansas city area rather than each individual cemetery.if the builders proposed geographic market here had been applied in monument builders of greater kansas city,there would have been no need to allege the market share,because each cemetery fully controls the interments within its own boundaries.
the builders borrowed the line in their complaint that cemeteries are distinct enterprises and have a unique public function from rosebrough monument memorial park cemetery association,cir.in rosebrough,the eighth circuit explained that a cemetery lot,like any piece of real estate,is unique.id.yet that court also focused on a defined geographic.noted that the defendants accounted for percent of the burials performed in the market area in.id.likewise,in moore jas.matthews,cir,the plaintiffs focused on lane county in oregon,where the defendant cemeteries accounted for of all interments.
one district court has commented that in both rosebrough and moore,the courts of appeal referred to the uniqueness of individual cemetery plots as providing the defendants with the necessary market power in that market however,the opinions also note that in both cases,the defendants controlled a substantial share of the cemetery market within a limited geographic area.monument builders all faiths mem l gardens,emphasis in original.no similar geographic area
