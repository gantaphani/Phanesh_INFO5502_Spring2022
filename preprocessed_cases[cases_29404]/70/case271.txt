the district court held ricardo arredondo in criminal contempt of court after finding that he gave fabricated evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel to support his petition for postconviction relief from a federal sentence for drug trafficking.arredondo appeals from this contempt conviction and from the district court accompanying denial of relief from his drug sentence.for the reasons explained below,we reverse the conviction for contempt but affirm the denial of postconviction relief.
arredondo was convicted in of three counts of distribution of heroin and conspiracy to distribute heroin,and sentenced to years in prison.in,with the assistance of another inmate,he filed a pro se petition under seeking relief from the sentence.as relevant here,the petition asserted that his appointed attorney,thomas plachta,provided constitutionally ineffective representation at sentencing by failing to communicate two alleged government plea offers to arredondo for approval.arredondo claims he would have accepted either of the offers if given the chance,and would thereby have obtained a lighter sentence than the one imposed on him.however,he stated,plachta never advised him of any plea offer.
arredondo trial judge had fixed a pretrial deadline of august,after which no plea offers could be extended.it is undisputed that assistant united states attorney michael hluchaniuk made one plea offer to plachta before this deadline,which would have involved a recommended sentence of five to ten years,and that plachta rejected this offer.the disputed issue regarding this offer is whether plachta first communicated it to arredondo for approval.
arredondo petition further alleged that hluchaniuk made a second offer of a sentence to plachta on the day of trial,and that plachta also rejected this offer without conveying it to his client.arredondo supported this allegation with two affidavits.one affiant,maria teneyuque,stated that her sister mary jane dietrich a material witness in arredondo trial had overheard plachta and hluchaniuk discussing a plea before the trial.arredondo also filed his own affidavit testifying that he had seen his lawyer talking with hluchaniuk on the day of trial,and had seen plachta shake his head no.
both plachta and hluchianiuk denied that any second offer was made.plachta did not squarely deny arredondo claim that plachta had failed to communicate the first offer.instead,plachta filed an affidavit stating that he could not specifically remember the events of that day,but that my practice has always been to communicate any plea offer made by the prosecution to my client regardless of my personal view as to the merits of the offer.
the district court denied arredondo section petition without an evidentiary hearing.arredondo then retained a different inmate paralegal to assist him and filed a pro se motion for reconsideration of the denial,pursuant to.e.this motion was accompanied by a new affidavit from arredondo that included new allegations that arredondo had himself heard some snippets of the alleged plea conversation between plachta and hluchaniuk on the day of trial,including a reference to a sentence.in this affidavit,arredondo stated that he had seen the prosecutor shake his head no.the new affidavit also alleged that plachta advised arredondo in words on the day of trial that he had rejected a government plea offer,in tension with the statement in the earlier affidavit that plachta had never advised him of any offer.however,in the same paragraph of the second affidavit,arredondo affirmed that plachta never made arredondo aware of a plea offer prior to trial.it is thus fairly clear that by made aware arredondo meant communicating the offer before rejecting it.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration and arredondo appealed to this court.
we reversed in part and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the petition.arredondo united states,cir.we agreed with the district court that arredondo was not entitled to a hearing on his allegations concerning the supposed second plea offer id.at.however,we held that he was entitled to a hearing on the circumstances surrounding the first plea offer.id.at 
in closing,we noted that the inconsistent accounts in the affidavits of plachta,hluchaniuk,and arredondo suggested that someone was not telling the truth 
arredondo has lodged serious claims that attack his attorney professional competence.if true,his petition deserves our attention if false,arredondo has 
lied in a endeavor that could have caused unwarranted discipline of his attorney.the courts should not encourage such actions by refusing to punish demonstrably false claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.
the district court held an evidentiary hearing on arredondo petition on january.arredondo repeated in court the allegations of his second affidavit plachta had failed to secure his client permission to reject two plea offers,and arredondo had personally heard fragments of the discussion concerning the second offer being discussed.assistant united states attorney hluchaniuk again testified that he made one plea offer to plachta prior to the court deadline,but no second offer.plachta testified that he did not specifically recall the plea discussions in arredondo case,but that it was always his practice to pass on such offers to his clients for approval.
the district court denied arredondo section petition.it rejected his testimony about the existence of the second plea offer and about plachta handling of the first offer the court went further,ordering a hearing on whether arredondo had committed criminal contempt of court by knowingly offering false evidence to support his petition.
after briefing and a hearing on the contempt issue,pursuant to.a the court found arredondo guilty of criminal contempt and imposed a sentence of six months in prison,consecutive to his prior sentence,and a fine.the court found that arredondo had engaged in a series of fabrications.it noted that arredondo story had changed materially from his first affidavit to his second one after the district court rejected the teneyuque affidavit as hearsay,arredondo introduced an assertion that he had heard part of the plea discussion,without explaining why this seemingly important fact was not included in his first affidavit.the court concluded that arredondo second affidavit had learned from the testimony that had come to light,suggesting a deliberate fabrication.the court deemed the affidavit particularly incredible in light of hluchaniuk denial of making any second plea offer.it also discounted arredondo claim that plachta failed to pass on the first plea offer.drawing on its own knowledge of plachta fastidious work habits,the court found that he had duly passed on the first plea offer to arredondo,and that arredondo had simply fabricated his testimony to the contrary.
the district court went on to hold that the fabrications it identified had significantly obstructed the administration of justice,thereby amounting to a contempt of court.it described arredondo testimony as involving egregious,blatant,and transparently false perjuries.it also noted that the perjured allegations of misconduct were integral to arredondo section postconviction litigation,which had consumed a significant amount of judicial and public resources,had been founded chiefly on falsehoods.finally,the court reasoned that arredondo false testimony about plachta had threatened to impose unwarranted professional discipline on an attorney,which also revealed a tendency to obstruct the administration of the justice system.
arredondo timely appealed from the contempt conviction and the denial of postconviction relief.
we find no basis for disturbing the district court factual findings that arredondo willfully fabricated the allegations about plachta misconduct in his affidavit and oral testimony.the record plainly supports the finding that arredondo statements about the alleged second plea offer were willfully false indeed,arredondo has not meaningfully challenged this conclusion.however,arredondo does contest the finding that he lied about plachta failing to pass on the first plea offer.while the evidence for this conclusion was controverted,it was sufficient to support the district court finding.plachta testified that he always passed on plea offers to clients.he had already represented five to fifteen criminal defendants in federal court at the time of arredondo trial,and had undertaken more representations since then.in light of plachta experience,his habit testimony was admissible under.to show that he acted in conformity with that habit in this case we can not say the district court decision to credit plachta testimony about the first plea offer and its finding that arredondo willfully fabricated his contrary testimony were clearly erroneous,especially in light of arredondo established lack of credibility in other matters such as the second plea offer.
these findings eliminate the factual basis for arrendondo claim that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to pass on plea offers to him.since that is the only ground on which arredondo has appealed the denial of his section petition,we affirm the denial of his petition without further discussion.
the remaining question is whether arredondo falsifications constituted contempt of court under.
the power to punish contempts is inherent in all courts,young united states ex rel.vuitton et fils,d quotation marks omitted,allowing them to protect themselves against assaults on their authority.however,because this power may be exercised without many of the normal procedural protections of a criminal trial,it is subject to constitutional and statutory limitations.a federal court has the power,codified in and,to punish such contempt of its authority,and none other,as the following m isbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice.this statutory language originated in the federal act of,and represented a drastic curtailment of the contempt power previously recognized.bloom illinois,d.
the narrow category of contempts committed in the actual presence of the court may be punished immediately by the judge who saw or heard the offending conduct.b.this summary power is reserved for exceptional circumstances such as acts threatening the judge or disrupting a hearing or obstructing court proceedings.vaughn city of flint,cir.other contempts,which need only be in or near the court presence,must be adjudicated according to the more developed procedure of.a,the procedure followed in this case,which mandates notice and an adversary hearing.even so,the rule a procedure is pretty summary,united states oberhellmann,cir,since the offended judge may initiate the proceeding without indictment,may impose sentence on the convicted contemnor,and,in a nonjury case like this one,may try the case himself.for this reason,contempt liability under rule a should be circumscribed as narrowly as is consistent with the maintenance of order and decorum essential to the effective operation of the judicial system.id.at.
a witness misconduct must obstruc t the administration of justice in order to be punishable as contempt.vaughn,at.arredondo main argument for reversal is that even if he gave knowingly false oral and written testimony in support of his section petition,this was legally insufficient under the circumstances here to constitute an obstruction of justice under.we review this mixed legal and factual question de novo.see united states baggett,cir applying this standard of review to obstruction of justice enhancement under sentencing guidelines.
two supreme court decisions provide important guidance.in ex parte hudgings,the court granted a writ of habeas corpus to a federal witness who had been imprisoned for contempt after giving implausible testimony that he could not verify the handwriting of his own business partners.the court held that in order to punish perjury in the presence of the court as a contempt there must be added to the essential elements of perjury the further element of obstruction to the court in the performance of its duty.id.at.emphasis added.cautioning against mistakenly attribut ing a necessarily inherent obstructive effect to false swearing,it emphasized the potentiality of oppression and wrong that would arise if courts could summarily punish witnesses for giving testimony with which the court disagreed.id.at.
the court reaffirmed hudgings in in re michael,upon which arredondo principally relies.a grand jury subpoenaed michael,a bankruptcy trustee,to testify about numerous checks that had been written from the bankrupt assets.he gave direct,unequivocal responses to questions before the grand jury,but the district court found that his answers were lies the lower courts held michael guilty of contempt,reasoning that he had block ed the inquiry of the grand jury by giving false testimony about the purposes of the checks.id.at.the supreme court unanimously reversed.it emphasized that the natural tendency of all false testimony is to mislead the finder of fact,but this does not,as such,render it contemptuous 
all perjured relevant testimony is at war with justice since it may produce a judgment not resting on truth.therefore it can not be denied that it tends to defeat the sole ultimate objective of a trial.it need not necessarily,however,obstruct or halt the judicial process.for the function of trial is to sift the truth from a mass of contradictory evidence,and to do so the factfinding tribunal must hear both truthful and false witnesses.
we applied michael in united states essex,cir,to reverse the obstruction of justice conviction of a witness who had filed a perjured affidavit.after the trial court disbelieved essex written testimony that she had sexual relations with several jurors in the trial of jimmy hoffa,see united states hoffa.denying hoffa a new trial,she was prosecuted and convicted under the federal obstruction of justice statute.essex,at.we noted that had grown out of the same act as the federal contempt statute,and therefore concluded that the dispositive issue was whether essex act of filing a false affidavit constitute d a contemptuous act within the meaning of.essex,at.we held that it did not.ibid 
michael and essex together make clear that false testimony alone,whether written or oral,will not amount to contempt of court.ibid.the government argues that several grounds distinguish arredondo conduct from the conduct at issue in michael and essex.upon consideration,however,we must reject each of these arguments for upholding arredondo contempt conviction.
first,the government argues that because arredondo false allegations concerned the performance of his attorney in his criminal trial,they obstructed the operation of the justice system in a way that routine perjuries do not.while the government cites no authority for this proposition,the supreme court upheld a contempt conviction for false swearing under a somewhat similar theory in clark united states.clark was a venire member who lied her way on to the jury with representations that she was unbiased,despite the fact that she was an ally of the defendant who would have voted for an acquittal regardless of the evidence.id.at.the supreme court held that she had trifled with the court of which she was a part,and made its processes a mockery,which was contempt,whatever else it may be besides.id.at.however,clark and its progeny,in re brogdon.upholding contempt conviction of juror who lied about his bias and prior knowledge of events at trial,are distinguishable from arredondo case.jurors and veniremen are officers of the court.their conduct is governed by a separate section of the federal contempt statute,prohibiting misbehavior by a court officer,as well as the generally applicable contempt provision of.here,arredondo was only a party,not an officer of the court.clark is also distinguishable from arredondo case in that clark falsehoods interfered with the machinery of the very trial in which she participated.as the supreme court later explained,clark perjury prevent ed the formation of a proper judicial tribunal.michael,at.in contrast,while arredondo falsehoods could be said to be about the administration of justice,inasmuch as the subject mat
