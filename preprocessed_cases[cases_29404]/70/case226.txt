appellant,douglas baum baum,appeals the modification of an injunction issued by the district court that enjoins baum from directly or indirectly filing claims in any federal or state court or agency in texas without the express written permission of judge lynn hughes.baum argues that the district court had no jurisdiction to sua sponte modify the permanent injunction,or alternatively,that the modification was too broad and an abuse of discretion.
factual procedural history 
douglas baum purports to run an asset recovery business.he researches various unclaimed funds,tries to locate the rightful owner,and then gets paid either with a finder fee or by taking an assignment.although he claims to work alone,the district court has determined that douglas baum acts in concert with his brother,brian baum,and his father,sheldon baum the baums.
in september,the baums injected themselves into a federal district court case styled clark mortenson,by recruiting sue a receiver,the receiver attorney,other investors,and those investors attorneys.d,the mortenson case.the district court,judge hughes presiding,determined that the baums pleadings were gratuitous,malicious attacks with legal propositions that were wholly disconnected from the facts of the defendants behavior.id.at.the district court admonished the baums for wrongfully interfering in the case,wrongfully holding themselves out to be attorneys licensed to practice in texas,lying to the parties and the court,and for generally abusing the judicial system.the district court stated 
this case is an example of guerilla warfare through litigation.the baums brought this suit to satisfy their illusion of hidden funds or to extort deals for their other clients.these claims were fraudulent.once instituted,the baums maintained them with singular ineptitude.when asked to explain their anything and sheldon baum did not tell the truth.
mortenson,d at.
the baums have wasted the time and money of the defendants and the scarce resources that the taxpayers entrust to the judiciary.they have flouted the authority of this authority they invoked.they have no concept of the purpose and function of the courts.they must compensate,and they must be excluded.
the district court sanctioned both brian and sheldon baum to ten days in jail and ordered them to pay in attorney fees to the defendants.id.at.the court also issued a permanent injunction against all three baums.id.douglas baum was prohibited from fil ing claims,directly or indirectly,in courts or with agencies in the state of texas without the express written permission of judge lynn hughes.id.at.december injunction.
the baums appealed the sanctions and december injunction to this court.in march,this court upheld the sanctions order in an unpublished opinion,but it limited the scope of the december injunction.clark mortenson,cir.this court noted that the december injunction made permanent a preliminary injunction that forbade the baums from making any claims against the mortenson defendants and related parties.id.at.therefore,this court determined that the december injunction was intended to only apply to the mortenson defendants and related parties,and not act as a bar to all future filings unrelated to the mortenson case.id.at.thus,this court limited the scope of the december injunction by interpreting it narrowly.id.march injunction.however,this court did not rule out the possibility that a broader injunction may be necessary in the future.this court stated the following 
we note that our statement in farguson mbank houston,cir,that a broader injunction,prohibiting any filings in any federal court without leave of that court may be appropriate if a litigant is engaging in a widespread practice of harassment of different people,could potentially apply to the baums.if the baums persist in a widespread practice that is deserving of such a broad sanction,then such an injunction could be appropriate.but here,as of now,we interpret this injunction as more narrow and appropriate based on the baums actions in relation to the mortenson case.
mortenson.at.
a little over a year later,in june,the baums entered an appearance in another bankruptcy case,in re zouhair danny hilal,cause the hilal case.prior to bankruptcy,danny hilal owned and operated several limited liability companies,including appellee,blue moon ventures blue moon primary business was purchasing real property at foreclosure sales and leasing those properties to residential tenants.most of the assets of the hilal estate consisted of interests in these limited liability companies.after danny hilal individually filed for bankruptcy,randy williams the trustee,the other appellee,was appointed chapter trustee over the hilal estate.
sheldon baum claimed to be a secured,judgment creditor in the hilal case,but he would not identify his claim.brian baum was again misleading the parties and the court as to being a licensed attorney in texas,and douglas baum participated in the scheme by posting a fake notice of federal tax lien on property related to the estate.
at the same time,appellee blue moon was involved in litigation in texas state court over its right to receive a deed to certain real property,referred to as the kelliwood property.the baums took an assignment of a right of redemption for the kelliwood property and,based on this alleged right,took up residence on the property.blue moon believed that the right of redemption was expired or invalid,so it filed a trespass to try title suit in state court to clarify ownership to this property.a second suit was simultaneously proceeding in state court in which the baums used linda chepolis,the girlfriend of brian baum,to file suit against the taxing authority,the constable,and an individual claiming to own an interest in blue moon the chepolis suit.
in the bankruptcy court,counsel for the trustee filed a motion to show cause to identify the creditors that the baums represent and for explanation of the basis of the baums claims.in august,after a hearing,the bankruptcy court,judge steen presiding,issued a memorandum and order imposing corrective sanctions,which described the similarity between the baums conduct in the mortenson case and the hilal case.the bankruptcy court concluded the following 
both in judge hughes case and in this one,the baums had no apparent connection to the parties or to the events until after the filing of legal proceedings.the baums injected themselves into both cases by recruiting,or seeking to recruit,defrauded creditors.the baums recruit by asserting that the efforts of the receiver trustee are insufficient.in judge hughes case,the baums promoted a suit against the state court receiver.in this case,the baums seek to bypass the efforts of the bankruptcy trustee to promote a proposal that apparently is designed to benefit the baums.
brian baum letter to creditors,douglas baum notices posted on property related to the estate,and sheldon baum preliminary outline of a chapter plan of reorganization are a continuation of a pattern of conduct identified by judge hughes that are materially misleading to creditors and parties in interest in this case.the court concludes that the following corrective sanctions are appropriate at this time,but reserves imposition of more severe sanctions if the pattern of conduct does not stop.
judge steen ordered that all three baums were not to interfere further with the administration of the hilal bankruptcy estate.judge steen also ordered that the clerk forward his memorandum and order to the district court for consideration of matters related to judge hughes case and for such further action as that court deems appropriate.
the district court,judge hughes presiding,then issued on its own motion,an order to show cause,directing the baums,including douglas baum,to appear and show why they should not be prohibited from,directly or indirectly,entering the court house,filing papers of any nature,or representing to anyone that they are playing any part in a proceeding in or related to this court.the baums were also ordered to appear to show why they should not be held in contempt for violating the permanent injunction of december.
the court conducted two hearings in which the baums all testified,as well as counsel for the appellees collectively referred to as blue moon.the court concluded that the baums had continued in their abusive litigation practices,and thus a modification of the march injunction was necessary.on april,the district court specifically enjoined douglas baum from directly or indirectly filing claims in courts or with agencies in the state of texas without the express written permission of judge lynn hughes.april injunction.thus,the district court modified the march injunction so that it was identical in scope to its original december injunction.the district court qualified the modification with the following statement because he has been consistently and swore that he intends to separate himself from his brother and father,after january,the court will revisit the portions of this injunction that apply to douglas baum.the district court order also stated that douglas baum had agreed to vacate the kelliwood property and dismiss the chepolis suit in state court in exchange for blue moon dismissing their state court claims against him.
douglas refused to agree to any modification of the march injunction on the grounds that it would impede his business.three days after the district court modified the march injunction,blue moon and the trustee filed a motion to be added as real parties in interest.the district court granted this motion and entered an order designating the appellees real parties in interest nunc pro tunc.douglas baum filed a timely notice of appeal.
to summarize,the december injunction was issued by the district court and references the injunction that barred douglas baum from filing any claims with any federal or state court or agency in texas without the express written permission of judge hughes.the march injunction was issued by this court and limited the scope of the injunction to the mortenson defendants and related parties.the april injunction was issued by the district court and expanded the scope of the injunction to its original dimensions.these three labels refer to the same injunction at different points in time.

baum does not dispute that the district court had jurisdiction to issue the december injunction.baum only argues that the district court could not sua sponte modify the march injunction when no party from either the mortenson case or the hilal case filed a motion to modify that injunction 
baum argues that the district court sua sponte modification of the march injunction violated the principles of res judicata,law of the case,and double jeopardy.baum cites to united states swift,for the proposition that a court is not allowed to reverse itself under the guise of modification.id.at.swift stands for the proposition that the availability of modification is not a substitute for a direct appeal from a judgment and modification is not a means by which a losing litigant can attack the court decree collaterally.charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane federal practice and procedure ed see swift,at.the injunction,whether right or wrong,is not subject to impeachment in its application to the conditions that existed at its making.in swift,justice cardozo held that changed factual circumstances did not warrant modification to alleviate or eliminate restrictions contained in the original consent decree.id.at.the crux of baum argument is that the district court had no jurisdiction to sua sponte attempt to reverse the ruling of the fifth circuit,the march injunction.in support of this argument,baum observes that the district court modification of the march injunction resulted in a injunction that was identical in scope to its original december injunction.
this court previously stated that the scope of the injunction could be broadened in the future based on changed factual circumstances.icee,at.if the district court had reinstated the original december injunction after the mortenson appeal without a change in the factual circumstances,then baum argument might have some merit,but the facts clearly indicate that baum continued to engage in abusive litigation practices after the december injunction was narrowly construed by this court in.baum reliance on swift is misplaced because the district court did not attempt to reverse or modify the march injunction in the absence of changed factual circumstances.swift does not indicate whether the district court may sua sponte modify the permanent injunction or whether changed factual circumstances support a modification that imposed additional restrictions on douglas baum.
furthermore,in swift,the supreme court acknowledged that the lower court had jurisdiction to review and modify the consent decree in question.see swift,at.we are not doubtful of the power of a court of equity to modify an injunction in adaptation to changed conditions,though it was entered by consent a continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as events may shape the need.swift supports the proposition that the district court had jurisdiction to modify the injunction based on changed factual circumstances.although the december injunction did not expressly reserve a power to modify,swift held that if the reservation had been omitted,power to modify still exists by force of principles inherent in the jurisdiction of the chancery.id.at.
blue moon argues that the district court retained jurisdiction over the injunction insofar as necessary to effectuate the purpose of that injunction.in support of this argument,blue moon cites to exxon texas motor exchange of houston,which recognized that an injunction may be modified to impose more stringent requirements on a defendant when the original purposes of the injunction are not being fulfilled in any material respect.at internal quotations omitted.blue moon argues that the purpose of the injunction was to prevent waste of judicial resources,and because the baums continued their vexatious filings after the mortenson appeal was decided,the district court modification of the march injunction was proper.in exxon,this court did not address whether modification can be sought on the district court own motion when no other party has sought redress.
blue moon observes that other circuits have expressly allowed district courts to sua sponte impose injunctions if the party enjoined is given notice and a hearing.in re oliver,cir notice and hearing required before the district court imposes a injunction against prisoner litigant,at.in,the second circuit has held that w here the jurisdiction of the federal courts is in need of protection,we need not await the arrival of a litigant able to show private relief a history of litigation entailing vexation,harassment and needless expense to other parties and an unnecessary burden on the courts and their supporting personnel is enough.at internal quotations omitted.we have previously cited in support of the proposition that the district court has authority to impose a injunction.day,at.we agree with the second circuit conclusion that a district court may sua sponte impose a injunction to deter vexatious filings,and we agree with its rationale for this conclusion 
federal courts have both the inherent power and the constitutional obligation to protect their jurisdiction from conduct which impairs their ability to carry out article iii functions.if such power did not exist,or if its exercise were somehow dependent upon the actions of another branch of government or upon the entitlement of a private party to injunctive relief,the independence and constitutional role of article iii courts would be endangered.
at.because the district court has jurisdiction to sua sponte impose a injunction to deter vexatious filings,it also has jurisdiction to sua sponte modify an existing permanent injunction to accomplish the same goal.
in determining whether it should impose a injunction or should modify an existing injunction to deter vexatious filings,a court must weigh all the relevant circumstances,including the following four factors 
the party history of litigation,in particular whether he has filed vexatious,harassing,or duplicative lawsuits whether the party had a good faith basis for pursuing the litigation,or simply intended to harass the extent of the burden on the courts and other parties resulting from the party filings and the adequacy of alternative sanctions.
cromer kraft foods,cir.we agree that the traditional standards for injunctive relief,irreparable injury and inadequate remedy at law,do not apply to the issuance of an injunction against a vexatious litigant,at.
notice and a hearing are required if the district court sua sponte imposes a injunction or sua sponte modifies an existing injunction to deter vexatious filings.in western water management,brown,the defendants complained of the district court sua sponte modification of a permanent injunction,which imposed additional restrictions on the defendants,cir.without addressing whether the district court had the authority to sua sponte modify the injunction,we vacated the injunction as an abuse of discretion because the modification was not preceded by appropriate notice and an opportunity for hearing.id.brown implies that the district court may sua sponte modify a permanent injunction if the parties are given prior notice and an opportunity for hearing.
we agree with the second circuit holding in that a district court has jurisdiction to sua sponte impose a injunction,and we believe that the rationale of that decision is equally applicable to a modification.although and brown imply that a district court may sua sponte modify an existing injunction to deter vexatious filings,they do not explicitly adopt this holding.based on our precedent,we conclude that the exercise of this power is permitted by rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
rule b states the following on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party from a final judgment or order when it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.see agostini felton,d holding that a party may obtain relief from a district court permanent injunction pursuant to rule b.the limitation period applicable to some of the grounds of relief in rule b is not applicable to the federal courts power to modify a continuing decree of injunction.ridley phillips petroleum,cir.b.a rule b motion is the appropriate vehicle for modifying a permanent injunction that has prospective effect,regardless of whether the modification expands restrictions or eliminates restrictions in the injunction.cook birmingham news,cir see brown,at a district court retains jurisdiction to modify an injunction to the defendants detriment under certain circumstances.we have previously held that the motion requirement of rule b can be satisfied on the district court own motion.mcdowell celebrezze,cir see jose belaval,cir noting circuit split on whether rule b bars a district court from sua sponte issuing relief from judgment.rule b need not necessarily be read as depriving the court of the power to act in the interest of justice in an unusual case in which its attention has been directed to the necessity for relief by means other than a motion.united states jacobs,cir.
in this unusual case,the district court concluded that the interest of justice required the modification of the march injunction to deter vexatious filings.we hold that if the modification is preceded by appropriate notice and an opportunity for hearing,the district court may sua sponte modify an injunction pursuant to rule b in order to deter vexatious filings because the issue is not before us,we express no opinion on whether the district court may sua sponte modify a permanent injunction that does not involve vexatious filings.
b.the district court did not abuse its discretion in modifying the injunction.
a district court modification of an injunction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.icee,at.modification of an injunction is appropriate when the legal or factual circumstances justifying the injunction have changed.id.
federal courts have the power to enjoin plaintiffs from future filings when those plaintiffs consistently abuse the court system and harass their opponents.see farguson,at.however,an injunction against future filings must be tailored to protect the courts and innocent parties,while preserving the legitimate rights of litigants.id.at.based on this principle,this court previously limited the december injunction to only enjoin baum from filing any additional claims against the mortenson defendants and related parties.however,this court cautioned baum that i f the baums persist in a widespread practice that is deserving of such a broad injunction,then a broader injunction could be appropriate.mortenson.at.
both judge hughes and judge steen determined that baum continued in his abusive litigation practices in both federal and state court.specifically,judge steen found that douglas baum posted notices that are deceptive in that they suggest that a notice of federal tax lien has been posted by the irs related to property that is,or may be,claimed by the hilal bankruptcy estate.at the hearing,douglas baum did not deny that he posted this fake notice of federal tax lien,and counsel for the irs informed the bankruptcy court that the irs had not authorized the posting.judge steen ordered the baums not to interfere with the administration of the hilal bankruptcy estate,including without limitations the publication of misleading information regarding tax liens lis pendens and the publication of false or misleading documents concerning the estate.furthermore,judge hughes found that douglas baum had conspired with his father and brother to wrongfully interfere in the hilal bankruptcy.
the district court could consider baum conduct in the state court proceedings in determining whether his conduct before the bankruptcy court was undertaken in bad faith or for an improper motive.see travelers ins.jude hosp.of kenner,cir regarding sanctions under.limiting the injunction to any particular defendants did not stop baum from repeating his pattern of abusive litigation practices therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that a broader injunction is necessary to protect both the court and future parties.see sierra club,lone star chapter cedar point oil,cir generally,a court should only modify an injunction to achieve the original purposes of the injunction,if those purposes have not been fully achieved.the remaining issue,however,is whether the modified injunction is too broad and not tailored so as to protect the legitimate rights of litigants.baum makes thr
