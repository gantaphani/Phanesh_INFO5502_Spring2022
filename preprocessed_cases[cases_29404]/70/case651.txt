introduction 
in this employment case,plaintiff and appellant nathalie thuy van van challenges a trial court order sanctioning her and finding her in contempt.the trial court found that van had disobeyed a prior court order by refusing to attend a deposition noticed by defendant and respondent language line,language line and had engaged in other discovery violations relating to her deposition.however,the prior court order van was found to have disobeyed did not order her to attend a deposition and it was not issued as a result of a motion to compel.it was instead only a denial of van own ex parte application to have her deposition stayed.language line did file a motion to compel van attendance and van filed a motion to quash the deposition notice but these were never ruled upon before the case was dismissed.there was,therefore,no prior court order which van disobeyed and no determination as to whether van had a substantial justification for not attending her deposition or whether she had a valid objection to the various deposition notices served by language line such as van claim that the location was more than miles from her home.
van asks that we reverse the order finding her in contempt and sanctioning her.as explained below,we will exercise our discretion to treat van appeal as a writ of prohibition insofar as the trial court found her in contempt and we will annul that finding.we will also reverse and remand for recalculation the trial court order sanctioning van in the amount of.
factual and procedural background 
this discovery dispute arose from a lawsuit filed by van against her employer,language line,in which she alleged several wrongful employment practices,including discrimination because of her vietnamese background,harassment based on her race,and a variety of wage and labor law violations.although both parties raise a host of arguments relating to the complicated procedural background of this case,we recount here only those that are relevant to our analysis.
starting in may language line began trying to take van deposition.the first deposition notice,served on may,called for van to appear on june and june at language line offices in monterey.a few days later,on may,van objected,stating,among other things,that the location set for the deposition was more than miles from her residence in milpitas in violation of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,that language line had not yet produced certain documents in response to her discovery requests,and that the deposition notice was oppressing her.van also notified language line that she would be filing an ex parte application on may,requesting a stay of her deposition until a pending motion she had already filed to compel language line to produce documents could be heard.
after some discussions between the parties which did not resolve matters,language line served an amended deposition notice,changing the dates of van deposition to begin on june van responded by essentially repeating,in writing,her previous objections,but this time noting that she would file an ex parte application on june asking for an order compelling mediation and again staying her deposition pending her motion to compel the production of language line documents.
van filed her ex parte application on june.the trial court denied it in an order signed and filed the same date.the text of the order reads as follows having reviewed plaintiff ex parte application for an order to mediate and for an order to stay deposition of plaintiff nathalie thuy van,and good cause appearing,it is hereby ordered that the parties denied.it is so ordered.the disjointed language,which we point out with no intended criticism,is explained by the fact that the trial court simply crossed out van proposed order granting her ex parte application and wrote denied across it.
on two more occasions,van objected to the pending deposition,still scheduled to begin on june.on that date,counsel for language line appeared for the deposition at the location in monterey but van did not attend more deposition notices were sent and each was met with essentially the same objections.the last notice,served on july,requested that van appear on august and at the same location as noticed before in monterey.
on july,language line filed the motion that gave rise to the order we are called upon to review.it was titled a motion for osc re contempt of court,monetary sanctions,and for terminating sanctions or,in the alternative,to compel plaintiff appearance.language line argued that van failure to appear for her deposition on june was in defiance of the court june order denying van ex parte motion to stay.language line sought fees and costs associated with its counsel appearance in monterey on june and terminating and monetary sanctions for what it argued were van defiance of the june order.as an alternative to the terminating sanctions,language line sought an order compelling van appearance at deposition on august and.language line also sought sanctions in the form of attorney fees for preparation of its motion.
on july,one day after language line filed its motion,van filed a motion to quash language line latest deposition notice,arguing,among other things,that the noticed location for the deposition was more than miles from her residence and that the taking of the deposition was unfair in light of what van viewed as language line delays in producing documents.van also filed an opposition to language line sanctions motion on august.
language line motion was heard on august the written order was signed on september and filed on september in general,it consists of three main parts.first,the court sanctioned van as attorney fees to language line for her unsuccessful ex parte application,which was found to be without substantial justification.
in the second part,the trial court recounted that even after entry of the june order,van kept objecting to language line deposition notices,asserted that she would not appear until language line had produced documents,submitted a notice of unavailability,and claimed that she was confused by the information she had received from the court.but,the court noted,it was more likely that van kept repeating her objections because she fully appreciated that the june order was entirely valid and she was refusing to comply with it.finding that van had failed to submit to an authorized method of discovery,disobeyed a court order to provide discovery,and failed to comply with a deposition notice,the court granted sanctions in the amount of attorney fees to language line in the amount of.
in the third part of the order,the court delayed ruling on language line request for terminating sanctions and alternative motion to compel van appearance at deposition all of which was included in language line motion until august,which was also set as the date that the court would hear van motion to quash.
on august several days after the hearing on language line motion but before a written order was signed or filed,van submitted a request for dismissal,which was entered by the clerk on the same day.on september,van filed the notice of appeal giving rise to our review of this matter.subsequently,in an order signed on september,the trial court granted judgment to language line awarding it costs as the prevailing party in the amount of.the judgment also reiterated that,consistent with the september order,van was to pay language line,for a sum total of.
