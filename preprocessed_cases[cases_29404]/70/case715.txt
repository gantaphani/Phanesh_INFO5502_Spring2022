our opinion today results in a partial win for appellant john luckett.as we explain below,courts do indeed have the statutory authority to lift a prefiling order entered against an individual adjudicated to be a vexatious litigant.and,while we affirm the trial court order declining to lift a prefiling order against john luckett this time,we also provide a roadmap as to how luckett,or any other a person already adjudicated to be a vexatious litigant,can succeed in having that determination lifted.
i.the issue of the perpetual vexatious litigant 
two cases have previously touched on though not directly tackled the general issue of the permanency of a vexatious litigant determination see code civ,subd.b,a determination which can entail a prefiling order requiring a vexatious litigant to obtain permission before he or she may file any further litigation see,subd.a.the two cases are wolfgram wells fargo bank th,d and pba,llc kpod,th,d.
wolfgram is a sustained examination of the general operation of the vexatious litigant statutes in light of the right to petition for redress of grievance under the state and federal constitutions.the case squarely held that the operation of california vexatious litigant statutes do not offend the right to because a vexatious litigant still retains the right to bring lawsuits even after a vexatious litigant determination.adopting professor tribe analogy of the vexatious litigant statutes as a kind of license or permit system to manage competing use of public facilities,the wolfgram court explained that the vexatious litigant statutes are narrowly drawn and reasonable in promoting the conservation of public judicial resources.see wolfgram,supra,th at,d.being narrowly drawn,california vexatious litigant statutes allow a vexatious litigant to continue to file lawsuits.they simply provide that the litigant may be required to post a bond in cases where there is not a reasonable probability that the vexatious litigant will prevail.id.at,d.given the standard,the bond requirement is not even as onerous as,say,a person who had been determined by the national park service to be a chronic litterer being required to post a deposit before being allowed to check in to a national park.if the parallel were exact,the park service would also have to make a showing that there was no reasonable probability that our chronic litterer would leave the campsite reasonably tidy.in perhaps the opinion most memorable passage,the wolfgram court stated that when a vexatious litigant knocks on the courthouse door with a colorable claim,he may enter.id.at,d.
as noted,the issue of possibly rescinding a vexatious litigant determination was only touched on,but not squarely addressed,in wolfgram.the vexatious litigant there,apparently as part of a shotgun blast of constitutional contentions,asserted that vexatious litigant status was a form of attainder in that the vexatious litigant status supposedly deprived him of his civil rights in perpetuum.wolfgram,supra,th at,fn,d.but that assertion was not developed in a proper heading or with any analysis,so the court considered the point waived.ibid.
on the other hand,there is nothing in the wolfgram analysis that suggests any constitutional problem with a vexatious litigant determination being permanent.if the vexatious litigant is still being afforded his or her right to petition in the immediate aftermath of a vexatious litigant determination and imposition of a prefiling order,he or she necessarily will retain those same constitutional rights for the indefinite future thereafter.the vexatious litigant status simply subjects the person in that category to the possibility of a reasonable restriction on his or her right to sue in propria persona,namely the possibility of a bond requirement.
pba,on the other hand,arose out of the specific context of one judge entering an order rescinding a previous judge vexatious litigant determination,so the issue was more squarely presented.the pba court appears to have read wolfgram for the proposition that a vexatious litigant determination may indeed be constitutionally permanent a natural,though only implicit,reading of wolfgram.but the pba court clearly found that proposition troubling.pba,supra,th at,d.the pba court said although section does not absolutely exclude the pro per litigant from the courts,we believe fundamental fairness requires the vexatious litigant brand be erasable in appropriate circumstances.id.at,d,italics in original.the pba court cited no authority for its belief.
strictly speaking,though,it would be an incorrect reading of pba to say that the case stands for the blanket proposition that a vexatious litigant determination is,in that court word,erasable in appropriate circumstances.first,in the very next paragraph after the fundamental fairness sentence,the court recharacterized what it had just said was a requirement into a mere conditional possibility,with a sentence that cast doubt on its fundamental fairness declaration.see pba,supra,th at,d even if it is theoretically possible to remove the brand of vexatious litigant.in that same vein,within three paragraphs of the fundamental fairness statement,the pba court devalued what it had said was a requirement of erasability to a mere assumption of a possibility.see ibid.assuming judge gale had the power to reverse judge morgan order declaring kennedy to be a vexatious litigant,he would at least have had to find a change in facts or circumstances showing the finding was no longer appropriate.
in any event,building on the assumption that a vexatious litigant brand could be erased,the pba court analogized the vexatious litigant statutes to an injunction under section.that analogy logically required the vexatious litigant to make a showing of a change in facts indicating a mending of his ways or conduct to support a reversal of the original determination.pba,supra,th at,d.in the case before the pba court,however,the latter judge rescinding order was not based on anything that amounted to a change in facts or circumstances sufficient to reverse the vexatious litigant order.id.at,d.
in light of the court subsequent hedging of its fundamental fairness language,the rule to be properly derived from pba is a conditional one while a vexatious litigant determination may,or may not,be erasable,if it is erasable,erasure requires substantial evidence that the vexatious litigant has mended his ways or conduct.see pba,supra,th at,d.
which brings us to the specifics of the case at hand.this appeal has its origins,ironically enough,in a vexatious litigant own reading of pba,which prompted a trial court motion on his part to rescind a prior vexatious litigant determination.the forum he selected for his motion was this case against wilma panos,as executor of the estate of a deceased attorney who once represented the vexatious litigant the trial court denied the motion,and this appeal is from the order of denial.
it falls our lot to complete the arc that pba least for the first time in a published opinion 
first,we note that the vexatious litigant statutes have a real world effect in only two possible ways either the vexatious litigant is required to post security in litigation already ongoing and will lose if he or she does,or is required to obtain permission of a presiding justice of the court where new litigation is to be filed,or both.
the first requirement of posting wholly dependent on some affirmative action taken by the defendant.the defendant must make a motion to have the court require the plaintiff to post security.if the defendant takes no action,any prior determination that a person is a vexatious litigant is nothing more than a tree falling in a forest with no one around to hear the crash.
the second way a vexatious litigant determination may actually have a real world requirement of a prefiling different.it can be initiated by the court on its own,or by a party,subd.a.thus a court may,even upon its own motion,enter a prefiling order requiring a person to first obtain permission of the relevant presiding justice before filing any litigation in that presiding justice court,and if it does so,disobedience to that order by the person may be punished by contempt,subd.a.further,the judicial council is charged with maintaining a list of persons against whom prefiling orders have been made,sub.e.
we should note here that there is nothing in the vexatious litigant statutes which requires the judicial council to maintain a list of persons who were,in the process of the adjudication of a defendant motion to require security,adjudged to be vexatious litigants.with,subd.e.under the statute,the official list of vexatious litigants is taken from prefiling orders made pursuant to section,as distinct from trial court orders requiring the furnishing of security pursuant to section et.
the definition of an injunction is found in section an injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to refrain from a particular act.it may be granted by the court in which the action is brought,or by a judge thereof and when granted by a judge,it may be enforced as an order of the court.in mcdowell watson th,d,the court also noted that injunctions can include the requirement to do an act,as well as not do an act in short,an injunction may be more completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to perform or to refrain from performing a particular act.see also comfort comfort cal d,passing reference to injunction as being an order to do or desist from certain action.most litigation over injunctions does not involve the definition of an injunction as such,but is over the need that injunctions be sufficiently definite to be enforceable.see pitchess superior court d.importance of injunction being definite enough to provide a standard of conduct for those whose activities are to be proscribed,as well as a standard for the court to use in ascertaining an alleged violation of the injunction.
by these standards,there is no question that the prefiling order contemplated by section,subdivision a is an injunction.it is,literally,an order requiring luckett to refrain from doing a particular any new litigation without certain permission.it is punishable by contempt.and it is sufficiently definite to be punishable by contempt.therefore,as an injunction,the prefiling order may be modified as provided in section,which articulates three independent bases on which a modification of an injunction may be predicated change in the facts,change in the law,or ends of justice.
the exact language of section is in any action,the court may on notice modify or dissolve an injunction or temporary restraining order upon a showing that there has been a material change in the facts upon which the injunction or temporary restraining order was granted,that the law upon which the injunction or temporary restraining order was granted has changed,or that the ends of justice would be served by the modification or dissolution of the injunction or temporary restraining order.
this is the completion of the arc which pba began.it turns out that there is no need to rely on any brooding fundamental fairness in the sky for the proposition that a vexatious litigant determination may be erased.at least in regards to prefiling orders,the legislature has already provided for erasure by a combination of statutes,read together,and taken as a whole.
we note further since,under section,the official list of vexatious litigants kept by the judicial council is wholly dependent upon the entry of a prefiling order by a california court somewhere,the official status of being a vexatious litigant,as reified on the official judicial council list,is therefore also erasable under section least when done in conjunction with an application for the lifting of a prefiling order pursuant to section 
throw a couple metaphors into a blender here,just because a vexatious litigant can change his spots does not mean he or she has turned a new leaf.take this case,for example.as in pba,where the vexatious litigant did not provide substantial evidence of a mending of his ways,neither is any such evidence present here.more particularly,as we shall explain below,mere success in some litigation by the vexatious litigant after a determination of vexatious litigant status under section is not evidence of a mending of the ways.
ii.this case 
this case orange county superior court case number is the same litigation as was the subject of this court unpublished opinion in luckett panos,nonpub,wl,hereinafter luckett ii.because luckett ii is relevant to the present case as a matter of law of the case and collateral estoppel,we may cite the opinion now in this case.see cal.rules of court,rule b.
in luckett ii,this court reversed the trial court order refusing to set aside a default judgment obtained by plaintiff john luckett against a now deceased nevada lawyer.luckett ii,supra,nonpub.opn.wl at.basically,the nevada lawyer,bill andrews,was never properly served,because the letter mailing the complaint to him was misleading,suggesting that he was being served as a corporation agent for service of process and not as an individual.id.at.we also noted that the default judgment was for,yet that judgment was based on a legal malpractice claim derived from the lawyer handling of luckett bankruptcy such that luckett lost his car.the high amount of claimed damages indicated a serious overinflation of damage claims.id.at,fn.we may take it as given that the car which the lawyer alleged malpractice cost luckett was not one in which luckett had a great deal of equity.as a matter of law of the case,luckett is now bound by that set aside order.he did get to keep that judgment later inflated to more than by assertion of interest and attorney fee claims.as a matter of collateral estoppel,he may not challenge this court earlier determination that he obtained a default judgment against a defendant who was never properly served.
after the january luckett ii decision was final,the default judgment obtained by luckett was apparently vacated.the clerk register of actions report in this appeal,however,contains no entries after the january,entry for any judgment.apparently,andrews estate was content to let well enough alone,and in this appeal now andrews estate informs this court that after the january order vacating the default and default judgment,nothing further occurred as regards the estate 
the case was getting so old,however,that the clerk of the superior court contemplated the destruction of the files.in july,then,luckett filed ex parte for,in substance,an order vacating the finding he was a vexatious litigant and also for an order instructing the clerk of the court not to destroy files.the points and authorities supporting the order to vacate the vexatious litigant finding made a number of references to the pba case.judge mceachen,sitting in that day for judge brenner,found no basis for granting the ex parte application.luckett then wrote a letter to judge brenner asking for reconsideration.on july,judge brenner heard argument from luckett and granted the request to re consider,but,having reconsidered it,stated the court lack ed jurisdiction and ha d no basis to grant the ex parte request.
however,the very next week,on july,judge brenner heard further argument to allow the court to review case law as cited in the ex parte papers.the record indicates that judge brenner heard argument again on august,this time on a request by luckett to stay vexatious litigant status in santa monica court.that specific request was denied,but the court set for a hearing for further review of the ex parte to vacate the vexatious litigant finding and to prevent destruction of the files.that further review was apparently actually heard the following month,and both issues were taken under submission.
nothing happened in the case during the year.the very next event in the litigation confirmed by the clerk register of actions in this appeal was a february filing,headed ex parte application for an immediate ruling s on motion s to vacate finding s of john luckett having been declared a vexatious litigant req.for order to clerk to preserve entire files from destruction.we will discuss the facts below,when we discuss the supporting declaration.
on march judge brenner heard argument on the application.only luckett was present.judge brenner granted the request to prevent the destruction of the file in the case.he denied the motion to vacate the finding that luckett was a vexatious litigant,but without prejudice.the denial without prejudice is an implied recognition of the pba paradigm that vexatious litigant status should be erasable in appropriate circumstances.the minute order denying the request was filed that very day,and luckett notice of appeal from that order was filed on march,less than two weeks later.
iii.luckett prior appellate cases 
before confronting the issues raised by luckett appeal,we take this opportunity to recount all previous appellate decisions involving john luckett.
in in re luckett d,hereinafter luckett i,this court,acting on its authority under section,found that john luckett is a vexatious litigant,and,acting on its authority under section,imposed on luckett a prefiling order barring luckett from filing any new litigation without leave of the presiding judge of the court where that new litigation is to be filed.the finding that luckett was a vexatious litigant was based on the fact that he had filed at least different appeals or writ petitions in this court while acting in propria persona,and that in of those proceedings he had filed unmeritorious motions,pleadings or other papers,or engaged in other tactics that were frivolous.id.at.we specifically noted that luckett had been relieved of the obligation to pay filing fees because of his statutory right to forma pauperis relief.id.at.
in the early came the unpublished decision in luckett ii,which we have described above.luckett ii is significant to our purposes in this case because it involved some initial obtaining of a large default though that success later evaporated when this court learned that luckett had served the defaulted defendant in a misleading manner.
last year,our colleagues in the second district had occasion to decide luckett keylee th,d,hereinafter luckett iii.luckett iii is likewise significant to our purposes in this case because it involved some preliminary procedural success on luckett part in litigation.
in luckett iii,luckett sued a group of nevada lawyers for improperly trying to enforce a nevada judgment against him the trial court initially determined that the action lacked merit because the complaint did not allege that luckett was affected by the nevada judgment,hence concluded that the action lacked merit,and,accordingly,required that luckett post a bond.however,on a reconsideration motion,luckett produced documents showing that he was indeed affected by the nevada judgment.while the trial court still denied the reconsideration motion,luckett soon met with the success of having that determination reversed in a writ petition.specifically,the appellate court reversed the order denying reconsideration.in response,the trial court lowered the bond amount to.that particular order,however,was not reversed,and luckett never posted even that bond,so the case was dismissed.luckett iii,supra,th at,d.then the nevada attorneys sought costs and attorney fees for their default win,which were both granted.luckett scored his second success in the litigation when,in an appeal from the cost and attorney fee order,the appellate court reasoned there was no authority to award fees,even though it upheld the cost order.id.at,d.
iv.appealability 
as noted above,there is no final judgment in this case.ironically,it is a reasonable inference that andrews estate apparently decided that obtaining one would itself only engender an appeal.
the absence of a final judgment creates a problem in terms of this court jurisdiction to hear luckett appeal.we do not,strictly speaking,have an order after a final judgment,as might otherwise make the order appealed from appealable under section,subdivision a.
however,we do have an order refusing to dissolve an injunction,which is also appealable under section,subdivision a.as demonstrated above,a prefiling order against a vexatious litigant meets the definition of an injunction the status of being a vexatious litigant insofar as it entails being on the official list of litigants against whom prefiling orders have been entered as maintained by the judicial council pursuant to section,subdivision e,is an incident to the entry of the prefiling order.
therefore,under the rule of liberal construction of notices of appeal cal.rules of court,rule a the notice is sufficient if it identifies the particular judgment or order being appealed,we deem luckett appeal to be from an order refusing to dissolve the permanent prefiling injunction this court issued in luckett i,which was necessarily in front of the trial court when it denied luckett request.we thus have appellate jurisdiction over the denial of the request to dissolve that injunction.
whether a change of circumstances was shown 
john luckett trial court application to have the finding of his being a vexatious litigant rescinded was based on the following points 
the passage of time.luckett was a mere years old when this court declared him to be a vexatious litigant just a kid then in the words of his he did know as much about the law,and the rules of court then as he knows now.
he won a default judgment in the very case before us 
back in,this court let him file separate writs and appeals in the period of one and one half years before declaring him to be a vexatious litigant,and in fact waived the filing fee for all those writs and appeals.
during the past and one half years,the orange county superior court has granted luckett requests to file at least lawsuits or more and he had prevailed on all of them,or settled out of court except for a few here and there,which were dismissed because luckett could not post the required bond under the vexatious litigant statutes.
a determination of being a vexatious litigant is,in luckett opinion,a medical finding for which no competent doctor ever made.rather,the original decision in luckett i declaring him to be a vexatious litigant was a decision made by court of appeals judges,as an attempt to blockade him from coming to court.in his brief on appeal,luckett elaborates on this point,asserting that vexatious litigation requires a medical opinion,because it is a disease,such as a compulsive gambler 
we must conclude that none of these reasons show a change of circumstances from those circumstances that first prompted this court entry of a prefiling order,or otherwise show that the interests of justice would require a vacation of that order.
to take the most obvious point first,luckett analogy to vexatious litigation being a mental disease if we were to take the argument at face an argument,under these circumstances,against lifting a determination of vexatious litigant status because it shows no change of status.if a propensity to vexatious litigation were indeed a mental disease,then once a person were adjudicated a vexatious litigant,under luckett logic,a doctor certificate would be required to erase the determination.
of course,that not luckett point at all.his point is that a doctor certificate should have been necessary before he was declared a vexatious litigant in the first place.but that argument also fails,because it suggests that vexatious litigation is the exclusive province of the mentally disordered.
to be sure,of course,many vexatious litigants probably do suffer from some sort of mental disorder,a fact that trial court staff around the state would appear to have first hand knowledge on the other hand,there is nothing in the statutes,either the definitional categories of section or in the prefiling statute,section,that necessarily confines vexatious litigation to those with mental disorders.and it is perfectly imaginable that a very sane,if doyle fictional moriarty comes to would be perfectly willing to pursue a course of vexatious litigation in the course of some ulterior purpose 
returning to the other facts in luckett supporting declaration,we find that his first listed passage of not show a mending of the ways at all.all luckett declaration shows is that,instead of devoting his life to something productive,he has spent the last years suing people.that fact only confirms the very trait of character on which the determination of vexatious litigant was first based.
the second obtaining of a default a blatant attempt to mislead the trial court.luckett did not mention that his default judgment was ordered set aside in luckett ii,and that it was set aside precisely because he had misled the defendant into thinking he had only been served in his capacity as agent for service of process.
a similar lack of regard for the true facts is shown in the third point,concerning the fact that this court did not require luckett to post filing fees in the spate of appeals that led to the initial determination of vexatious litigant status in luckett i.the luckett i opinion explicitly noted that the reason luckett was able to file writs and appeals before we could stop him was because he was using his in forma pauperis status to avoid paying filing fees.if luckett actually had to pay his own filing fees,we doubt that he would have filed so many cases in the first place.
the fourth point,like the first,only confirms the correctness of the original vexatious litigant determination,because it shows that luckett has spent a good portion of his time over the last years suing people.to be sure,his declaration avers that he was able to obtain permission from presiding judges to file litigation,but that fact does not show a mending of the ways.rather,it only shows that the vexatious litigant statutes are operating the way they are supposed to operate.by the same token,the fact that some of the litigation which luckett has brought resulted in settlement proves nothing,because some defendants may have paid token amounts to make the litigation go himself acknowledged that very fact at oral luckett may have dismissed it as part of a settlement.indeed,one legal commentator notes that settling suits brought by vexatious litigants has the effect of preventing judges later on from realizing just how frivolous those earlier suits might have been.rawles article,supra.at.
vi.how a change of circumstances may be shown in the future 
relevant criteria 
so,the trial court was clearly correct to deny the application.
however,as noted,the denial was without prejudice,and,as we have explained,a prefiling order under section,being an injunction,is not ipso facto permanent.luckett might yet be able to show a change of circumstances under section justifying the lifting of the section prefiling order.for the benefit of any future trial judges faced with such an application from luckett or a similar litigant,let us offer these observations as to some of the factors that necessarily bear on whether a vexatious litigant had mended his ways.
first,it goes without saying the applicant must show a propensity for honesty in his or her application.that means an accurate confrontation with the facts on which the prior vexatious litigant finding was made,as well as intervening facts that might not put the application in a favorable light.
honesty also means,in those cases where a vexatious litigant claims in forma pauperis status,that the applicant must have,as he or she is required to do by statute,notified the court of any change in financial circumstances or settlements received that would enable him to pay even a portion of the fees otherwise waived by the in forma pauperis status.see,subd.d a litigant proceeding in forma pauperis shall notify the court within five days of any settlement or monetary consideration received in settlement of this litigation and of any other change in financial circumstances that affects the litigant ability to pay court fees and costs.italics added.
second,the applicant should show some genuine remorse for the costs of litigation inflicted on the defendants who were the object of previous lawsuits.let us here note the major costs that obsessive,vexatious litigants inflict on others they force their opponents to incur unnecessary expense defending themselves one insurance company spent defending itself against a vexatious litigant while a public university spent defending itself against the same litigant see rawles article,supra.at and consume public judicial resources better devoted elsewhere id.at.
third,in the same vein as section,subdivision d requirement that in forma pauperis litigants notify the court within five days of any changed financial circumstances allowing them to pay part or all of their filing fees,an applicant to erase vexatious litigant status should,consistent with his or her financial situation,show some genuine effort at restitution toward the previous victims of his litigation,including actual payment of cost orders made by the courts in that litigation.
it should be noted here that the combination of in forma pauperis status,which can make a person,to use the lawyer phrase,the sort of mindset that leads to a declaration of vexatious litigant status,and the inclination to file cases in pro,is a truly horrific combination.it means that an individual who fits within in forma pauperis status may use a typewriter as a weapon,filing lawsuits even if he or she has to obtain permission first at virtually no cost to himself or herself,and without fear of ever being required to pay sanctions or an adverse judgment.
fourth,the applicant must actually give up the habit of suing people as a way of life.it is not some success in litigation,even after a person is adjudged to be a vexatious litigant,that shows a change of circumstances.just the opposite is the case.even some interim procedural success may simply encourage the habit of litigation as a way of spending one free time.
we emphasize this point of law as the wolfgram court demonstrated,the vexatious litigant statutes already make ample provision to protect the vexatious litigant right to petition and obtain redress in the courts.a vexatious litigant who has a genuinely meritorious lawsuit will not be subject to an order to post security,and will have no problem obtaining a presiding judge permission in the first place.
daytime television in the early century has been full of judge shows,where ordinary people bring a dispute for decision before a celebrity jurist.if nothing else,those shows illustrate that life is full of occasions when a a legally meritorious be brought over the pettiest of circumstances.people with too much time on their hands and a propensity to sue people will always find occasion to bring a lawsuit.a real change of circumstances may entail efforts at obtaining gainful employment 
as the court in wolfgram cogently noted,most people never sue anybody.wolfgram,supra,th at,d.
b.the problem of the correct venue 
we now come to the final problem as regards the possible lifting of a vexatious litigant prefiling order under section at oral argument at the trial level,judge brenner openly speculated as to whether his court,in this case,was the correct forum for luckett to bring his motion to have his vexatious litigant status lifted.nevertheless,despite his doubts,he entertained the motion,patiently heard oral argument,and ruled.
for the benefit of future cases,however,we observe that the statutes,read together and as a whole,indicate that any attempt to erase a vexatious litigant prefiling order should be brought in the forum that originally entered the prefiling order.
first,the text of section indicates that a court a might enter such a prefiling order in the ordinary course of some given litigation involving a given defendant or b might,as this court did in luckett i,enter such an order on its own motion,in response to many cases brought by a vexatious litigant in the latter situation,though,there is no traditional adversarial proceeding between two litigants generating the section prefiling order.rather,there is an administrative proceeding action by the court itself.
second,the text of section opens with the qualifying clause,in any action and section,subdivision a indicates that action at least for purposes of the vexatious litigant any civil action or proceeding in any state.now,to read in any action in section to refer to any civil case at all would be absurd,no mat
