background 
in april,the securities and exchange commission sec commenced a civil securities enforcement action based on allegations of fraud and wrongdoing by lynn smith husband,david smith,and his business partner,timothy mcginn.the two men operated an financial services company,mcginn,smith,and a number of related entities,through which they are alleged to have defrauded investors of more than million in violation of,inter alia,section a of the securities act of,a,and section b of the securities exchange act of,b.specifically,the complaint states that timothy mcginn and david smith deceived investors in four funds by telling them that their money would be invested when instead it was funneled into various mcginn smith companies where it was used to make unauthorized investments,to support mcginn and smith lifestyles,and to cover the payroll at mcginn,smith.
simultaneous with the filing of the initial complaint in this action,the sec sought a preliminary injunction appointing a receiver to take possession of the defendants assets directing defendants to provide verified accountings freezing the defendants assets,including those held in the name of lynn smith and prohibiting the destruction,alteration or concealment of documents.sec mcginn,smith,cv gls drh,docket.magistrate judge homer held a hearing on the sec motion in june.because david smith had already consented to the preliminary injunction by the date of the hearing,the central issue for the hearing was the extent to which assets held by lynn smith,as a,could be subjected to a freeze.
at that hearing,lynn smith testified that the assets held solely in her name consisted primarily of a stock account inherited from her father,a vacation home in new york,a vacation home in florida,which had initially been owned jointly by david and lynn smith,and a checking account lynn smith had opened in her own name in.sec mcginn,smith,cv gls drh,at,july,docket.the magistrate judge rejected lynn smith testimony,instead concluding that even though the stock account was technically in lynn smith name,the smiths were joint owners of the account because david smith had unfettered control over the account for years,deposited money into it,and used it to loan money to mcginn smith companies to cover operating expenses.in reaching this conclusion,the magistrate judge declined to credit lynn smith testimony,noting that it was improbabl e lacked credible corroborating evidence and was inconsisten t and incredible.sec mcginn,smith,cv gls drh,at july,docket.
with respect to the checking account and the florida house,for two principal reasons,the magistrate judge concluded that both assets were jointly owned by david and lynn smith.first,lynn smith opened the checking account and transferred the house into her sole name only after the commencement of financial industry regulatory authority finra proceedings investigating david smith.second,both assets were used jointly,and in particular,the house was treated no differently after it was transferred into lynn smith sole name.id.at.the magistrate judge directed lynn smith to hold and retain within her control,and otherwise prevent,any encumbrance dissipation or other disposal of any assets including money,real or personal property.sec mcginn,smith,cv gls drh,at july,docket.the new york vacation home was exempted from the freeze,because the magistrate judge found that it was never controlled by david smith.at that time,the magistrate judge also declined to freeze the assets of a trust created in the early for the benefit of david and lynn smith two children,concluding that the trust benefits did not flow to david smith and he did not exercise control over them such that he treated the corpus as his own.sec mcginn,smith,cv gls drh,at july,docket.
the sec later discovered a annuity agreement relating to the trust that required the trustee to make annual payments of approximately to david and lynn smith beginning in and continuing until their deaths or until the trust was exhausted.sec mcginn,smith,cv gls drh,at,docket.in light of this agreement,which david and lynn smith had failed to disclose,the sec filed a motion to reconsider the magistrate judge earlier order and requested that the magistrate judge the trust.in november,the magistrate judge granted the sec request.the magistrate judge further determined that lynn smith of the annuity agreement satisfie d the requirements for fraud,misrepresentation,and misconduct,and authorized the sec to seek sanctions against her.id.at.
one month later,the magistrate judge denied a motion filed by lynn smith for release of assets filed.lynn smith had sought the release of per month for her continued,which included expenses surrounding the maintenance of the smiths primary residence located in new york attorneys fees in the amount of and per month for necessary expenses associated with the florida home,including mortgage payments.the magistrate judge concluded that lynn smith had failed to demonstrate the financial need required to obtain this relief.sec mcginn,smith,cv gls drh,at,docket.specifically,the magistrate judge noted that lynn smith received at least from the july sale of her new york vacation home,which should allow payment of all reasonable legal and living expenses for the foreseeable future without the necessity of lifting the asset freeze for her in any respect.id.at.lynn smith has never provided any documentation of her expenditure of the funds received from the sale of the new york vacation home.
after the magistrate judge denied lynn smith motion,the sec moved to modify the asset freeze to permit the sale of the florida vacation home.at that time,the mortgage was more than days past due and had an amount owing of.the sec filing indicated that in november,lynn smith attorney had contacted the sec to suggest the sale of the florida house,because the bills were piling up.the sec had agreed to the sale but sought to have a receiver,and not lynn smith,oversee it.shortly thereafter,lynn smith told the sec that she no longer supported the sale.
in support of its motion to lift the asset freeze in order to liquidate the florida house,the sec argued that the value of the house would continue to decline sharply every month as mortgage costs,taxes,and other expenses continue to accrue and remain unpaid,and the only option that would preserve the equity in the p roperty for the benefit of investors was a sale.the sec argued that the magistrate judge had authority to order the sale because lynn smith was in violation of the preliminary injunction directing her to prevent any encumbrance or dissipation of any assets including real or personal property.the sec also argued that the magistrate judge had inherent authority under section d of the securities exchange act of,d,to order the sale of the property in order to preserve the status quo.
on february,the district court entered an order granting the sec motion to amend the asset freeze to permit the sale of the florida house.the magistrate judge determined that the securities laws authorized the court to exercise broad equitable discretion to fashion the appropriate injunctions when faced with alleged violations of securities laws.sec mcginn,smith,cv gls drh,at,docket quoting sec fischbach,cir.the magist
