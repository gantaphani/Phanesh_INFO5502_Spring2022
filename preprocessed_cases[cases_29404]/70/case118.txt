kristan peters,an attorney admitted to the bars of both new york and connecticut and formerly a partner at the law firm of dorsey whitney,appeals from an order of the committee on grievances for the united states district court for the southern district of new york the grievance committee suspending her from practicing before that court for a period of seven years.the grievance committee found that she had engaged in the following misconduct 
instructing a junior attorney,jordan brackett,to deface transcripts in order to render them,under the guise of the attorney privilege,unreturnable to the district court the brackett allegation and 
violating a confidentiality order issued by the district court by filing,in a massachusetts action,transcript excerpts encompassed by that order the confidentiality order allegation 
see in re peters,d,interim suspension order in re peters,m,doc.at,disbarment order,based on the findings and reasoning of the interim suspension order in re peters,m,doc.at,order reducing penalty from disbarment to suspension,based on mitigating factors.the grievance committee concluded that peters misconduct had violated new york disciplinary rule dr a,which prohibited conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice dr a,which prohibited a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation and dr a,which prohibited a lawyer from disregarding,or advising a client to disregard,a ruling of a tribunal made in the course of a proceeding see peters,d at peters,m,doc.at.
in her brief,peters argues,inter alia,that the grievance committee failure to hold an independent hearing,and its reliance on a prior sanctions hearing conducted by judge baer in the underlying litigation,violated her due process rights and the district court local rules.she also argues that the two charges of misconduct now at issue do not,as a matter of law,support the grievance committee imposition of discipline.although this court already has affirmed the underlying sanctions order entered by judge baer to the extent he reprimanded peters,the two charges upon which the grievance committee suspension is based were not addressed in that prior appeal,since this court limited its review of judge baer order to three other charges.see wolters kluwer fin,scivantage,cir,affirming,in part,d judge baer sanctions decision.except as discussed below,we assume the parties familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.
this court review of an original disciplinary order entered by a district court is governed by the abuse of discretion standard,although the issue of whether a disciplinary rule prohibits the conduct in question is reviewed de novo.see in re edelstein,cir.a district court has abused its discretion if its imposition of sanctions was based on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.wolters kluwer,at internal quotation marks omitted.however,when the district court is accuser,fact finder and sentencing judge all in one,as was essentially the case here,this court review is more exacting than under the ordinary standard.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,even under the deferential standard of review,this court must be careful to ensure that any decision to impose sanctions is made with restraint and discretion.schlaifer nance estate of warhol,cir.
because an attorney disciplinary proceeding is in nature,the due process clause entitles the charged attorney to,inter alia,adequate advance notice of the charges,and the opportunity to effectively respond to the charges and confront and witnesses.see in re ruffalo,erdmann stevens,cir a court disciplinary proceeding against a member of its bar is comparable to a criminal rather than to a civil proceeding.
in examining the grievance committee decision not to hold a full evidentiary hearing,this court consider s the private interest affected by the action of the grievance committee in following judge baer sanctions decision without holding an independent evidentiary hearing,the risk of erroneous deprivation of that private interest,and the grievance committee interest in foregoing an evidentiary hearing.in re jacobs,cir citing mathews eldridge.this court has held that a district court grievance committee decision not to hold a full evidentiary hearing did not violate the charged attorney due process rights when the risk of erroneous deprivation of the attorney interest in practicing before the district court was extremely low,and there was an important public interest in not expending judicial resources on a proceeding that would largely duplicate a prior proceeding,given that the attorney had made no showing that such a hearing would reveal an infirmity of proof or lack of due process in the prior proceeding or risk of grave injustice from suspending the attorney on the basis of a prior order.id.at holding that a district court grievance committee reliance on a state court findings,without holding an independent hearing,did not violate the attorney due process rights.
with respect to the brackett allegation,an independent evidentiary hearing would not have been duplicative of judge baer sanctions proceeding since,in that prior proceeding,peters was not provided adequate prior notice of that allegation or adequate opportunity to respond and to adverse witnesses.with respect to the confidentiality order allegation,although peters had adequate notice and opportunity to respond to the allegation during the prior proceeding,the evidence concerning the allegation was not adequately developed during that prior proceeding so as to permit the grievance committee to forego an independent evidentiary hearing in the present matter.we therefore vacate the grievance committee suspension order and remand the matter for the committee to hold further proceedings consistent with our decision.
brackett allegation 
collateral estoppel,res judicata,and law of the case 
first,this court never reviewed the particular charges on which the committee based its discipline.instead,in the appeal from judge baer sanction order,this court stated that it need only review a sampling of peters conduct to affirm the district court imposition of sanctions,and then discussed three charges not now at issue.wolters kluwer,at.the court then concluded as follows 
having reviewed these three instances,we see no need to consider the other sanctions for which the district court issued reprimands.no likely argument has been advanced as to why the other nineteen sanctions are defective,and because the sanctions are all,the subtraction of one or another from the whole course of conduct would not alter the nature or tenor of the district court rulings.
id.at.although the court saw no likely argument concerning the sanctioned conduct presently at issue,the court nonetheless made clear that appellate review had been limited to the sampling of conduct explicitly discussed in the opinion.we therefore disagree with the grievance committee statements that judge baer conclusions regarding the incident involving brackett have been affirmed by the second circuit,in re peters,m,doc.at,and that t he second circuit affirmed all of the sanctions on peters,id.at.thus,the committee was incorrect to rely on such preclusion doctrines as collateral estoppel and res judicata in finding that it need not hold its own hearing.see niagara mohawk power tonawanda band of seneca indians,cir it is a principle of federal law that if an appellate court considers only one of a lower court alternative bases for its holding,affirming the judgment without reaching the alternative bases,only the basis that is actually considered can have any preclusive effect in subsequent litigation.gelb royal globe ins,cir i f an appeal is taken and the appellate court affirms on one ground and disregards the other,there is no collateral estoppel as to the unreviewed ground.restatement second of judgments cmt.o.
the committee also relied on the law of the case doctrine in finding that it need not hold its own hearing.the law of the case doctrine,although not binding,counsels a court against revisiting its prior rulings in subsequent stages of the same case absent cogent and compelling reasons,including,inter alia,the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.ali mukasey,cir quoting united states tenzer,cir.we need not address whether the present matter is the same case as judge baer sanctions proceeding because,even assuming arguendo that the doctrine could apply,the present issues are sufficiently compelling to warrant revisiting the brackett allegation.see id.
notice and opportunity to respond 
second,this court due process analysis in wolters kluwer is of limited aid in the present appeal because the notice peters received in judge baer sanctions proceeding concerning the brackett allegation,and her opportunity to respond,differed significantly from the notice and opportunity to respond she had concerning the three charges discussed in this court wolters kluwer decision.as an initial matter,the brackett allegation was not included in the defendants sanctions motion,see peters app.app.at,although judge baer noted in his sanctions order that he had specifically reiterated at the beginning of the hearings that the district court was only considering the same issues raised by the sanctions motion,wolters kluwer,d at see also app.at letter from judge baer,copied to all attorneys,concerning sanctions hearing the scope of the hearing will encompass the relief requested by defendants in their motion for contempt,sanctions,and fees,similar statement by judge baer at beginning of the hearing.while that description of the scope of the sanctions hearing may not be controlling,since an attorney may receive adequate notice of a misconduct charge by means other than a sanctions motion served prior to the sanctions hearing,see mullane cent.hanover bank trust,explaining that due process requires only notice of such nature as reasonably to convey the required information,it does not appear,on the present record,that peters received adequate notice of,and opportunity to respond to,the brackett charge by any means 
the sanctions motion charged peters with,inter alia,failing to deliver all deposition transcripts to the district court,in violation of judge baer protective order,which required her firm to deliver all of the transcripts to him.see app.at.although the brackett allegation was related to peters alleged intention to retain transcripts in violation of judge baer order,the sanctions motion contained nothing that would suggest to a reasonable person that the brackett allegation might be a basis for sanctions.there is a simple explanation for this the sanctions motion was signed and served on april,see id.at docket cv,doc,item at cert.of service while the brackett allegation concerned an event that occurred on april,see app.at brackett decl.
the brackett allegation did not surface during the sanctions proceeding until september,the third day of the five days of hearings before judge baer,when a witness testified that he had been told that peters had directed brackett to write attorney notes on clean copies of deposition transcripts.see id.at.however,the focus at that point remained whether the law firm or peters had possessed transcripts that previously should have been delivered to the court.see generally id.at.in fact,peters of that witness barely touched on his mention of the brackett allegation in that regard,peters simply asked if the witness had himself heard the conversation between brackett and peters,and whether the witness had participated in the decision not to call brackett as a witness in the sanctions hearing,at which point judge baer stated,we can fix that.id.at.at that time,it appears that the brackett allegation was regarded as evidence relevant to whether peters intended to deliver all of the transcripts covered by the protective order to the district court,and not as a separate charge of misconduct.
by letter dated september,judge baer requested brackett to submit a declaration regarding his involvement in the litigation,particularly regarding his involvement in activities relating to the allegations that he had been directed to alter transcripts provided to the district court.doc,item.judge baer also stated that,after reviewing brackett declaration,he would decide if brackett would be called as a witness.id.the declaration itself is dated september,see app.at it was emailed to judge baer law clerk and peters attorney,among others,on september,see doc,item and both peters and her attorney acknowledged receipt of the declaration on that day,see id.at items,app.at.
upon peters receipt of the brackett declaration,one arguably might conclude that she was then on notice that the transcript defacement allegation constituted a disciplinary charge that could subject her to sanctions.however,judge baer did not explicitly characterize it as such,and other attorneys intimately involved in the proceedings apparently still did not recognize it as a charge.after peters responded to brackett declaration by requesting an opportunity to brackett and several other persons,see doc,item,an opposing attorney objected to peters and blatant effort to protract the proceedings,and listed the six issues that the attorney believed were before the district court,a list which did not include the brackett allegation,see id.at item.despite these ambiguities,for purposes of this decision,we assume that peters had notice of the brackett charge as of september,but find that,for the reasons that follow,she nonetheless did not have adequate time to respond to that charge.
it is not clear how much time peters had,after receipt of the brackett declaration on september,to prepare for her of brackett on september.while peters may have had some preparation time on september,she and her counsel were occupied for substantial portions of the next two days by the hearing itself on september,the hearing ran from approximately to approximately,see app.at,and,on september,it began at,see id.at.additionally,any preparation time peters may have had on september and also had to cover four witnesses other than brackett who were to testify on september and,and peters own testimony on september.peters also may have spent some of her available time preparing for several other possible witnesses who ultimately did not testify.see id.at peters requesting testimony of three attorneys,plaintiff counsel noting possible need to call three defendants,peters requesting testimony of five witnesses.however,even if we assume that peters had to prepare only for four potentially adverse witnesses,and not for her own testimony,those four witnesses were relevant to a number of the charges in the sanctions motion,and not simply the brackett allegation.
furthermore,judge baer informed the attorneys on september that the september hearing would run from to,see id.at,with brackett taking no more than or minutes,id.at,clearly requiring peters to prioritize her preparation time,presumably giving greater priority to the witnesses and allegations directly relevant to the known charges.but,as discussed above,it is not clear when the brackett allegation became a known charge one that independently exposed her to possible sanction in that proceeding or,if it was a known charge by september,a charge important enough to warrant reallocating scarce resources and time away from the issues that,up to that point,had been treated as the central issues.
since the brackett allegation was,at the very least,an important basis for the suspension,we assume that peters would have him on it if she had had unlimited time for.see id.at peters requesting another witness to provide the exact words used by brackett for impeachment purposes,mem.of law in supp.of mot.to compel discovery filed,objecting to,inter alia,the truncated opportunity for cross examination of witnesses such as jordan brackett who have brought what judge baer has indicated he deems the most serious allegations against peters.of course,no lawyer is permitted unlimited rather,t he scope and extent of are generally within the sound discretion of the trial court,and the decision to restrict will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.united states rosa,cir see also united states elfgeeh,cir.although the trial court may,under proper circumstances,impose a time limit on,see united states casamento,cir upholding time limit when defense counsel had adequate time to elicit evidence of witness motive for testifying falsely and counsel had not identified other areas of inquiry they wished to pursue,such limits should be imposed with caution,united states vest,cir stating that a trial judge rigid adherence to time limitations would prevent the judge from making the necessary particularized judgment as to the proper length of.
here,we are not directly reviewing judge baer decision to limit peters of brackett instead,we are reviewing the grievance committee reliance on the procedures employed by judge baer,which included that limitation.that distinction may be highly relevant here since judge baer only imposed a reprimand,and specifically declined to suspend peters,finding it more appropriate to refer peters to the grievance committee because of the procedural protections inherent to that process.wolters kluwer,d at.it is not known which specific procedural protections judge baer had in mind however,that statement suggests that the very judge who conducted the hearing did not believe that the procedures employed were necessarily sufficient for purposes of a suspension.
during the september,hearing,judge baer stated that peters would have fifteen minutes to brackett,see app.at,and then kept a close eye on the clock,announcing when only five minutes remained,id.at,and when only two minutes remained,id.at,and stopping peters id.the transcript defacement issue,which was not covered by peters,was first mentioned during opposing counsel redirect examination of brackett,with judge baer asking the only question relevant to the present proceeding soliciting from brackett that he did not believe that peters statement that he should scribble on the transcripts was said in jest.id.at.after that,judge baer immediately excused brackett from the stand.id.
under these circumstances,we do not agree that peters chose not to directly brackett about the defacement allegation.in re peters,d at quoting wolters kluwer,d at.instead,the record strongly suggests that peters simply ran out of time as a result of the strict time limit imposed by judge baer.furthermore,although the grievance committee noted that the brackett spann ed pages of the transcript and that one of peters lawyers was present,neither of those facts suggests that peters had adequate time to question brackett on the defacement issue,given that his declaration covered a number of topics relevant to several of the misconduct charges.
additionally,the limited advance notice of the brackett allegation severely restricted peters ability to investigate and obtain impeachment evidence relevant to that charge,beyond the evidence and witnesses already scheduled for presentation to judge baer.we do not,however,comment on whether peters was prejudiced by that particular limitation,which may be mooted in whole or part by the further proceedings to be held by the grievance committee.
in light of the more exacting standard that applies to this matter,wolters kluwer,at quoting perez,at,we conclude that peters was denied due process with respect to the brackett allegation and vacate the grievance committee suspension order to the extent it was based on that allegation.however,the grievance committee is free,on remand,to hold further proceedings concerning that charge,providing peters with sufficient opportunity to respond and adverse witnesses.in those further proceedings,the grievance committee should decide,in the first instance,what evidence peters should be permitted to present in her defense,and,if the grievance committee declines to consider particular proffered evidence,it should provide detailed findings in support of that decision.for example,regarding the committee finding that peters had unreasonably delayed in presenting certain evidence from peters former secretary,see in re peters,m,doc.at spa,it is not clear to us what prior opportunity peters had to present that evidence,or how it substantially altered her position.however,since the scope of any new proceedings will be decided by the grievance committee,any further discussion of potential evidence would be speculative.
we also decline to consider,at this juncture,whether peters suspension may be based on a conclusion that peters statements to brackett evidenced,at a minimum,a reckless disregard of the prohibitions of the new york disciplinary code.in re peters,d at see peters br.at.if that issue remains relevant on remand,peters should present her argument on that point to the grievance committee for its consideration in the first instance.
ii.confidentiality order allegation 
notice of charge 
we reject peters argument that she had inadequate notice of the confidentiality order allegation prior to judge baer hearing see peters br.at.first,peters argument that this allegation was not included in any way,shape or form in the sanctions motion,id.at,is incorrect.although the defendants did not,in a separate count,charge peters with violating the confidentiality order,that allegation was made in several sections of the motion 
as part of the charge that peters had improperly refused to return discovery and had attempted to use discovery from the new york action in the massachusetts action,see app.at the unmistakable inference from plaintiff conduct is that it intends to use the discovery it tricked the defendants into providing in this matter in the massachusetts action or otherwise,for its own improper benefit now that the new york action has concluded,the only reason for plaintiff counsel request for leave to share transcripts with its client is to misappropriate defendants information,either in the massachusetts action or for plaintiff business purposes.meanwhile,the complaint in the massachusetts action clearly utilizes information gleaned from the depositions in this case,in further violation of the confidentiality order issued in this case.emphasis in original,stating that,after the plaintiff argued that plaintiff needed to retain a copy of the discovery documents for the massachusetts action,the district court indicated that the plaintiff would have to take discovery anew in any such action and ordered plaintiff to return all discovery to the court this directive also was consistent with the confidentiality order issued in the case,which unambiguously prohibited the use of material marked confidential or highly confidential in connection with any other proceeding.citations omitted 
as part of the request that the district court bar the use in any other action of any materials covered by the confidentiality order,see id.at plaintiff and its counsel breached the confidentiality order express prohibition on using discovery information in other cases by utilizing information gleaned from attorneys eyes only depositions in the massachusetts complaint and necessarily sharing it with their massachusetts counsel.the court should thus enforce the confidentiality order and bar plaintiff,its affiliates,its employees,and its counsel,from using discovery from this case in the massachusetts action.
as part of the request that plaintiff counsel be disqualified from prosecuting the massachusetts action,see id.at pursuant to the confidentiality order,the parties were required to treat confidential information or information exchanged on an attorneys eyes only basis as protected material,as defined therein.as such,this material was ordered not to be used in any other litigation proceeding.confidentiality order a at.despite this confidentiality order,plaintiff counsel has already shown its willingness to use such information in the massachusetts action.and 
as part of their argument that the plaintiff should be held in civil contempt,see id.at stating that plaintiff massachusetts complaint utiliz ed information obtained in discovery in this action designated as attorneys eyes only,despite this court confidentiality order on april,which provides,inter alia,that material so designated shall not be used in any other litigation proceeding.protective order a at.
through the portions of the defendants sanction motion,a reasonable person would have been on notice that the confidentiality order allegation,if proved,could lead to sanctions.see mullane,at in re jacobs,at.peters herself appears to have reached that very conclusion as of may,when she signed an affidavit and a memorandum of law in support of her firm opposition to the sanctions motion.see app.at mem.of law,peters aff.in that affidavit and memorandum,peters explicitly treated the confidentiality order allegation as an asserted ground for sanctions.id.at.the relevant portion of the memorandum begins as follows 
defendants contend that sanctions are warranted in this case due to plaintiff use of the deposition transcripts from the new york action,which defendants had designated as attorneys eyes only,in motion papers filed under seal in the massachusetts action.defendants assert that this use of the transcripts constituted a violation of the confidentiality order warranting sanctions.dorsey strenuously opposes this grounds sic for sanctions.
in her brief,peters argues that the sanctions motion could not have included the confidentiality order allegation,because the transcript excerpts were filed in massachusetts after the sanctions motion was delivered to dorsey offices on april.peters br.at emphasis in original.however,the allegations in the sanctions motion concerning violation of the confidentiality order were broad enough to encompass both violations that had already occurred and violations that were anticipated.see app.at the unmistakable inference from plaintiff conduct is that it intends otherwise.in any event,a reasonable person could not read the defendants request for sanctions based on the prior filings in massachusetts violating the confidentiality order without realizing that similar subsequent filings in massachusetts would likely also be at issue.additionally,a defense against sanctions for the filings in massachusetts did not require different preparation than a defense against sanctions for the filings the primary issue was not whether particular filings were improper,but whether the massachusetts action was the same action as the new york action for purposes of the confidentiality order.
peters also received adequate advance notice of the charge through the district court may order,in which the district court made clear that the confidentiality order allegation constituted a ground for sanctions that would be considered during the sanctions proceeding.see wolters kluwer fin,scivantage,cv,wl,at may,plaintiff counsel also suggested that following plaintiff voluntary dismissal,this court repeated orders to return discovery forthwith concomitantly modified the confidentiality order and granted her the ability to use transcripts of these attorneys eyes only depositions in the massachusetts action.such a contention strains credulity.i will address plaintiff actions,however,in a future opinion regarding defendants motion for contempt and sanctions,once such motion is fully briefed i will decline,at this time,to direct plaintiff to redact from its filings in the massachusetts action the attorneys eyes only transcripts of depositions taken in this action i will reserve decision on that sanction,as well as the more serious sanctions,including contempt,requested by defendants these sanctions,as well as the branch of defendant motion that seeks disqualification of plaintiff counsel from the massachusetts action,will abide the fully briefed motion and any hearings that are warranted.internal citations and footnote omitted.
thus,peters had ample notice of this charge prior to the commencement of judge baer sanctions proceeding.
b.the confidentiality order was violated 
although we do not find the confidentiality order to be,in all relevant respects,crystal clear,in re peters,d at,we conclude that it barred the use,in the massachusetts action,of new york discovery materials covered by the order.
the confidentiality order states,in various provisions,that it governs the handling of confidential documents in this action used at least nineteen times,the action used once,this lawsuit used twice,the litigation used thrice,this litigation used once,the litigation used once,and this case used once app.at confidentiality order.the order also references these actions and each action,id.at,which appear to be errors and,in any event,are not relevant to the present issue.although use of these different phrases introduced a degree of ambiguity,the context makes apparent that all of these phrases were meant to be synonymous and refer to the same legal proceeding.however,we agree with peters that such phrases may,depending on the circumstances,refer to a group of separate,but related,legal proceedings before more than one court or judge,rather than a single action with a single docket number in a single court.since these phrases are not defined in the order,and are susceptible to different definitions,most of them are of little use in interpreting the scope of the order.
we focus on two portions of the order.first,paragraph of the order contains the following language 
b access to confidential information.in the absence of written permission from the producing party or designating party,as applicable,or an order of the court,any protected material consisting of or containing confidential information shall be used solely for purposes of the prosecution and defense of the litigation.
confidentiality order b.paragraph c is identical to b,except that the phrase,attorneys eyes only information,is used in place of confidential information.although one can argue over the precise meaning of litigation,there is no plausible definition of that phrase that would encompass both the new york action and the massachusetts action.refers to the title appearing on the first page of the confidentiality order itself however,every conceivable part of that litigation title differs from the comparable portion of the massachusetts action title a the names of the parties differ,in that the massachusetts action involved one additional plaintiff and one additional defendant b the name of the court differs and c the docket number differs.
second,after defining court as referring to the united states district court for the southern district of new york,see confidentiality order l,the order states that the court may overrule a party confidentiality designation,id.a the court may permit the use of confidential material for purposes beyond the litigation,id.b c court employees owe no duty to the parties to maintain the confidentiality of documents filed with the court,id.a applications and motions to the court appending confidential materials are to be filed under seal with the caption of this case appearing on the outside of the envelope,id.b the parties may move the court to resolve disputes over the sealing of documents,id.c the party challenging a confidentiality designation may seek relief from the court,id.and t he court shall retain jurisdiction,even after termination of this lawsuit,to enforce this order and to make such amendments and modifications to this order as may be appropriate,id.these procedures and remedies,limited exclusively to the southern district of new york,would make no sense if the order were read as a permitting any party,without leave,to file confidential documents in any other court,b giving the southern district authority over filings and other proceedings in other courts.the order clearly anticipates that the southern district,and no other court,would control all matters of confidentiality covered by the order.an essential component of that control is the requirement that confidential documents be used only in that case in that court 
to the extent that peters argues that the confidentiality order was orally modified by judge baer in some fashion relevant to the present issue,see peters br.at,we reject the argument.although judge baer addressed the treatment of discovery materials on several occasions,peters has not cited any o
