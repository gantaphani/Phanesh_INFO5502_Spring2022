this case arises out of a grade crossing accident in which frank stevenson was injured and his wife was killed.in this diversity lawsuit against the union pacific railroad company union pacific or the railroad,a jury awarded damages to stevenson and rebecca harshberger as administratrix of mary stevenson estate on claims of negligence.union pacific appeals,and stevenson cross appeals.we affirm in part and reverse and remand for a new trial.we affirm on the issues raised in the.
on november,a union pacific train struck the stevensons vehicle as it crossed the tracks on highway in vanndale,arkansas.stevenson died as a result of the collision,and stevenson suffered severe injuries and has no memory of the accident.stevenson and the administratrix of his wife estate filed this action alleging that the accident was caused by union pacific negligence.later,they amended their complaint to include additional negligence claims and to add operation lifesaver,operation lifesaver as a defendant,asserting that it made negligent and fraudulent misrepresentations concerning the safety of the crossing.the district court granted partial summary judgment,dismissing several negligence claims,including allegations concerning the speed of the train.stevenson union pacific,d.the district court also granted operation lifesaver motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
the plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions on the ground that union pacific had destroyed evidence,namely,a voice tape of conversations between the train crew and dispatch at the time of the accident and track maintenance records from before the accident.union pacific argued that sanctions were not justified because it destroyed the documents in good faith pursuant to its routine document retention policies.the district court granted the motion following a evidentiary hearing.the district court imposed sanctions of an adverse inference instruction regarding the destroyed evidence and an award of costs and attorneys fees incurred as a result of the spoliation of evidence.stevenson union pacific.
prior to trial,the plaintiffs filed a motion in limine,seeking to prohibit union pacific from calling witnesses to explain that it destroyed the tape and track maintenance records pursuant to its routine document retention policies.the district court granted the motion and,at the outset of trial,orally instructed the jury that the voice tape and track inspection records were destroyed by the railroad and should have been preserved,and that the jurors may,but are not required to,assume that the contents of the voice tapes and track inspection records would have been adverse,or detrimental,to the defendant.trial tr.at.the district court thus permitted the plaintiffs to immediately reference the destroyed material and the fact that union pacific willfully destroyed it,but denied union pacific any opportunity to offer its routine document retention policy as an innocent explanation for its destruction of the evidence.
the parties stipulated that the only liability issues for trial were whether the train sounded its horn appropriately,whether the vegetation at the crossing obstructed stevenson view,and whether the crossing surface was negligently maintained.at the close of trial,over union pacific renewed objection,the district court repeated the spoliation instruction to the jury you may,but are not required to,assume that the contents of the voice tape and track inspection records would have been adverse,or detrimental,to the defendant.instr,trial tr.at.union pacific moved for judgment as a matter of law on the horn claim,asserting that there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could find that the alleged failure to sound the horn was a proximate cause of the accident.the district court denied the motion.
the jury returned a general verdict in favor of the plaintiffs,awarding stevenson in damages and awarding the estate for funeral and ambulance expenses.the district court entered judgment on these amounts and also awarded the plaintiffs in costs and attorneys fees on the sanctions order.union pacific appeals,asserting that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the alleged horn violation,that the district court abused its discretion in giving the adverse inference instruction,and that the district court abused its discretion by ordering attorneys fees as sanctions.stevenson filed a,challenging the district court partial grant of summary judgment concerning the speed of the train and appealing the order dismissing the defendant operation lifesaver.
a.the horn claim 
at trial,the plaintiffs alleged that the train crew did not properly sound the horn and that this failure proximately caused the accident.the train conductor testified that the engineer began sounding the horn at the whistle board feet from the crossing,blowing a sequence of two longs,a short,and a long as required by union pacific rules,all the way through the crossing.the event recorder on the train was malfunctioning and did not record any horn soundings for the entire trip on the day of the accident.several lay witnesses testified that they did not hear a horn sound before the collision.one witness who lived to yards south of the crossing testified that he heard two horn blasts which lasted about ten seconds but were off in the distance,not directly before the collision.
an expert audiologist,david lipscomb,testified on behalf of the plaintiffs that he had measured the sound output generated by the horn and the reduction of sound as it penetrated the interior of the stevensons car.lipscomb testified that,placing the horn blasts some witnesses heard at the tree line feet from the intersection,the train horn might have been detectable for up to six seconds before the collision,but the sound would not have been alerting given the noise inside the car.trial tr.at.on,lipscomb testified that under the conditions present at the time of the accident,even if the horn had been blown all the way through the intersection,it was his opinion that the horn would not have alerted stevenson until less than one second before the short a time to avoid the collision.trial tr.at.union pacific asserts that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the horn claim,arguing that the alleged failure to sound the horn could not have been the proximate cause of the accident because the plaintiffs own expert testified that blowing the horn all the way through the intersection would not have prevented the collision.
we review de novo the district court denial of a postverdict motion for judgment as a matter of law,considering whether the record contains sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict.racicky farmland,cir.we examine the sufficiency of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,and judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only when all of the evidence points one way and is susceptible of no reasonable inference sustaining the verdict.id.
in this diversity action,we apply arkansas substantive negligence law.see jordan nucor,cir applying the law of the forum state in a diversity action for negligence.to justify submitting a claim of negligence to the jury under arkansas law,a plaintiff must show that the defendant breached a duty of care,that the plaintiff sustained damages,and that the defendant negligence proximately caused the damages.barriga and.proximate causation is usually an issue for the jury to decide in a negligence action,and when there is evidence to establish a causal connection between negligence of the defendant and damage to the plaintiff,it is proper for the case to go to the jury in other words,proximate causation becomes a question of law only if reasonable minds could not differ.id.
in this case,we can not say that reasonable minds could not differ on the horn issue.in addition to the expert testimony,lay witnesses testified to close encounters with union pacific trains at the same intersection.in each instance,the lay witnesses had been able to avoid an accident where the engineer had blown the horn at the last moment.one witness was able to quickly back up off of the tracks and avoid a collision where the engineer had not blown the whistle until he saw the witness vehicle.trial tr.at.other witnesses said the horn did not blow at all but they avoided a collision by seeing the train at the last minute.at least one lay witness testified that,while the horn blew at the last moment and he was able to avoid a collision,he believed he would have been alerted sooner had the whistle blown before the engineer saw his vehicle.trial tr.at.
the jury was free to believe the lay testimony and disregard the expert testimony.the jury may use common sense in evaluating witness testimony and may disregard all or part of any witness testimony,even that of an expert.it is for the jury to decide who to believe and who not to believe.united states barrett,cir.determining the credibility of a witness is the jury province,whether the witness is lay or expert.dicarlo keller ladders,cir.we thus conclude that the district court did not err in denying judgment as a matter of law on the horn claim.
both prior to the filing of the lawsuit and during its pendency,union pacific destroyed two types of tape of any recorded voice radio communications between the train crew and dispatchers on the date of the accident and all track maintenance records close in time to the accident.the district court imposed sanctions for this conduct under its inherent power by giving an adverse inference instruction,refusing to permit testimony to rebut the adverse inference,and imposing an award of attorneys fees.
we review a district court imposition of sanctions under its inherent power for an abuse of discretion.dillon nissan motor,cir see also chambers nasco,d discussing the inherent powers of federal courts.a court inherent power includes the discretionary ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.chambers,at.our interpretation of supreme court authority concerning a court inherent power to sanction counsels that a finding of bad faith is not always necessary to the court exercise of its inherent power to impose sanctions.id.at harlan lewis,cir noting bad faith requirement does not extend to every possible disciplinary exercise of the court inherent power.the union pacific argues that the sanctions were an abuse of discretion because it did not engage in bad faith conduct by destroying evidence pursuant to document retention policies.we will consider the extent to which a finding of bad faith is necessary separately below with regard to each type of sanction employed.finally,whether the extent of a sanction is appropriate is a question peculiarly committed to the district court.dillon,at.
the adverse inference instruction 
at the close of trial,over union pacific renewed objection and as a sanction for the destruction of records,the district court instructed the jury,y ou may,but are not required to,assume that the contents of the voice tape and track inspection records would have been adverse,or detrimental,to the defendant.instr,trial tr.at.union pacific asserts that the sanction of giving an adverse inference instruction in this case amounted to an abuse of discretion,citing both federal and arkansas law.we need not decide and do not reach any choice of law question in this case because the standard is the same under either state or federal must be a finding of intentional destruction indicating a desire to suppress the truth.see lewy remington arms,cir citing federal law for the general proposition that the adverse inference instruction is appropriate only where the spoliation or destruction of evidence is intentional and indicates a fraud or desire to suppress the truth rodgers cwr constr,noting that s poliation is defined as the intentional destruction of evidence and that when it is established,the factfinder may draw an inference that the evidence destroyed was unfavorable to the party responsible for its spoliation,quoting goff harold ives trucking,alterations omitted.
the district court imposed this sanction of an adverse inference instruction after concluding that union pacific destroyed the voice tape in bad faith appellant add.at,and that union pacific destroyed the track maintenance records in circumstances where it knew or should have known that the documents would become material and should have preserved them id.at.the district court reached these conclusions after discussing the factors set forth in lewy,requiring the court to consider whether the record retention policy is reasonable considering the facts and circumstances surrounding those documents,whether lawsuits or complaints have been filed frequently concerning the type of records at issue,and whether the document retention policy was instituted in bad faith.at.
in lewy,we were called upon to address the prelitigation destruction of documents pursuant to a routine document retention policy,but the record was insufficient for us to decide whether the trial court erred by giving the adverse inference instruction.id.consequently,we set forth the guidelines for the court to consider on remand,and they include a bad faith consideration.see id.by way of example,and as dicta,we also stated that if a corporation knew or should have known that the documents would become material at some point in the future then such documents should have been preserved.id.in support of this proposition,however,we quoted gumbs int l harvester,cir,which states that the adverse inference from the destruction of evidence arises only where the destruction was intentional and indicates a fraud and a desire to suppress the truth,and it does not arise where the destruction was a matter of routine with no fraudulent intent.thus,while in dicta we articulated a knew or should have known negligence standard,such a standard,standing alone,would be inconsistent with the bad faith consideration and the intentional destruction required to impose an adverse inference for the prelitigation destruction of documents.we have never approved of giving an adverse inference instruction on the basis of prelitigation destruction of evidence through a routine document retention policy on the basis of negligence alone where a routine document retention policy has been followed in this context,we now clarify that there must be some indication of an intent to destroy the evidence for the purpose of obstructing or suppressing the truth in order to impose the sanction of an adverse inference instruction.see lewy,at.
the facts here are as follows.the accident occurred on november.the stevensons filed this lawsuit on september,and mailed their requests for production of the voice tape on october.by that time,union pacific had long since destroyed the voice tape from the november,accident by recording over it in accordance with the company routine procedure of keeping voice tapes for days and then reusing the tapes.the district court found that although union pacific voice tape retention policy was not unreasonable or instituted in bad faith,it was unreasonable and amounted to bad faith conduct for union pacific to adhere to the principle in the circumstances of this case.
in support of its bad faith determination,the district court found that union pacific had been involved in many grade crossing collisions and knew that the taped conversations would be relevant in any potential litigation regarding an accident that resulted in death and serious injury.there was evidence that mike reed,a claims representative for union pacific,had received notice of the accident shortly after it occurred,and he immediately began his investigation by calling the railroad risk management communications center to get details about the accident.he also called the harriman dispatching center in omaha to request copies of the train orders and warrants,the train consist,and a dispatcher record of the train movement.he did not,however,request a copy of the voice tape.the district court listened to available samples of this type of voice tape and found that they generally contain evidence that is discoverable and useful in developing a case.additionally,the district court found that union pacific had preserved such tapes in cases wher
