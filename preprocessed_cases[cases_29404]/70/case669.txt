introduction 
defendant and appellant morse mehrban mehrban appeals from the trial court order denying his special motion to strike filed under the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute,code of civil procedure section mehrban contends that the statutory requirements were met in that the complaint is one arising from protected activity and plaintiff and respondent jsj limited partnership jsj did not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its causes of action for abuse of process and malicious prosecution.we hold that the litigation privilege bars the claim for abuse of process and that the voluntary dismissal of a claim after a court held that the claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata was not a favorable termination for purposes of malicious prosecution.because the motion should have been granted,we reverse and remand the matter to the trial court to grant the motion and to determine whether mehrban is entitled to an award of attorney fees.
background 
garcia lawsuit 
in,alfredo garcia filed a complaint against jsj asserting one cause of action entitled violation of civil code sections and lawsuit.mehrban was garcia attorney in that lawsuit and filed the complaint on garcia behalf.in that complaint,garcia alleged that jsj was the owner and lessor of a parcel of real property on which a restaurant was operated.garcia alleged that he could not walk and was bound,and when he patronized the restaurant on five occasions in january and february,he was unable to use the restroom paper towel and toilet seat cover dispensers because they were mounted too far above the floor,and unable to use the toilet because it failed to provide him two grab support bars.garcia sought for each violation of civil code sections and,and attorney fees and costs following a court trial,the trial court entered judgment in favor of jsj.
garcia lawsuit 
in,garcia,with mehrban as his counsel,filed a second complaint against jsj lawsuit.in that case,garcia alleged two causes of action,entitled violation of civil code section and violation of civil code sections and,respectively.garcia again alleged that jsj was the owner of a parcel of real property on which a restaurant parking lot was located and garcia could not walk and was bound.in this complaint,garcia alleged that during the preceding year,jsj failed and refused to provide him a designated handicap parking spot with a inch wide access aisle,and garcia would have patronized said facility on at least occasions during that period but for the fact that he knew he would be denied full and equal access to the parking lot.garcia sought in damages,permanent injunctive relief,attorney fees,and costs 
the trial court sustained jsj demurrer to the complaint on the ground that the doctrine of res judicata barred garcia claim and granted garcia days leave to amend the complaint,stating,garcia acknowledges that both the lawsuit and the lawsuit assert violations of the ada americans with disabilities act of,et based on architectural barriers garcia argument that the difference between the architectural barriers inability to use the restroom versus inability to use the parking lot bars the application of res judicata has no merit nor can garcia elude the effect of res judicata by arguing that res judicata is not a bar to claims that arise after the initial complaint is filed.in his opposition garcia asserts that his attempts to use the parking lot occurred in september,after the visits he made in january and february when he was unable to use the bathroom.however,nowhere in the complaint does garcia allege the date or dates on which he attempted to visit the restaurant there is no allegation that he attempted to visit the restaurant in september but was unable to do so due to lack of a handicap parking spot.further,based on garcia assertion in his opposition that he attempted to visit the restaurant in september,the pleading appears to be a sham since garcia alleged in the first lawsuit that he in fact visited the restaurant in january and february.these purported facts give rise to the reasonable inference that the lack of a handicap parking spot did not deter garcia from visiting the restaurant in january and february.garcia did not amend the complaint and filed a request for dismissal as to the entire action without prejudice.
c.this action 
in,jsj filed a verified complaint against mehrban and garcia alleging causes of action for malicious prosecution and abuse of process.jsj alleged that the trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint in the lawsuit,granting garcia days leave to amend,but garcia did not amend the complaint and dismissed the entire action without prejudice,in sustaining the demurrer the trial court stated,as noted above,the pleading appears to be a sham,the complaints in the lawsuit and lawsuit directly contradict each other,and jsj files this lawsuit against mehrban for contriving the lawsuit for retribution because jsj prevailed in the first lawsuit.
in its claim for malicious prosecution,jsj alleged that mehrban knew or should have known the complaint in the lawsuit had no merit,mehrban caused the complaint to be filed without probable cause,and the complaint was filed for retribution and to require jsj to spend his sic money unnecessarily.in its claim for abuse of process,jsj alleged that mehrban and garcia claimed in the lawsuit they could not patronize jsj restaurant,even though a few weeks before they were testifying in the lawsuit that they entered and patronized the restaurant.mehrban and garcia filed a voluntary dismissal that was in response to the court ruling on the demurrer and written statement that the subject complaint was a sham pleading.mehrban and garcia acted without probable cause in initiating the prosecution of the lawsuit,in that they did not honestly,reasonable,sic and in good faith believe jsj to be liable therein because they knew that garcia had not even gone to the restaurant and was simply filing the lawsuit as retribution for prevailing on the prior lawsuit.mehrban and garcia filed the lawsuit solely out of a malicious motivation to cause harm to jsj 
mehrban filed a special motion to strike the lawsuit under section motion,contending that the complaint he filed on behalf of garcia arose from a protected activity.he contended that jsj could not show a probability of prevailing on its abuse of process claim because the complaint in the lawsuit was privileged under the litigation privilege doctrine.mehrban argued that jsj could not show a probability of prevailing on its malicious prosecution claim because the lawsuit was not terminated in jsj favor on the merits,the complaint in the lawsuit was instituted by mehrban with probable cause in that the lawsuit was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata,it was not a sham,and the facts alleged had been transmitted to mehrban by garcia and verified by garcia under penalty of perjury,and mehrban did not institute the lawsuit with malice.in support of mehrban motion,garcia declared that because there were problems arranging for legal representation for an appeal,he decided voluntarily to dismiss the lawsuit.he also recited the facts underlying his claim.mehrban confirmed that garcia had told him of those facts before he filed the action and that he was unable at the time to handle the appeal.
jsj opposed the motion,contending that its complaint did not arise from a protected activity for purposes of section,and that it could establish a probability of prevailing on its claims.jsj managing partner stated that jsj had been in compliance with the ada.jsj submitted additional material that reflected adversely on garcia,and mehrban filed a responsive declaration by garcia.the trial court,after ruling on evidentiary objections,denied the motion,but did not state its rationale for doing so.

a slapp suit a strategic lawsuit against public participation seeks to chill or punish a party exercise of constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances.citation.the legislature enacted code of civil procedure section known as the statute to provide a procedural remedy to dispose of lawsuits that are brought to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights.citation.rusheen cohen cal th,d.rohde wolf th.the goal of section is to eliminate meritless or retaliatory litigation at an early stage of the proceedings.seelig infinity broadcasting th.

protected activity 
mehrban contends that he met his burden of proving jsj claims arise from protected activity.jsj disagrees,contending that its complaint is not attempting to stop a citizen right to bring a claim under the american with disabilities act jsj file d the lawsuit because jsj knows it to be a fact that the disabled parking access has been in existence since therefore,it would have been impossible for garcia to truthfully state in his lawsuit that there was no parking access for the disabled as alleged in the lawsuit.jsj further contends that mehrban had reason to believe that garcia fabricated the lawsuit because prior lawsuits brought by garcia were not meritorious,and that garcia used money from the lawsuits to support himself.
the subjective intent of a party in filing a complaint is irrelevant in determining whether it falls within the ambit of section.there simply is nothing in the statute requiring the court to engage in an inquiry as to the plaintiff subjective motivations before it may determine whether the statute is applicable.damon ocean hills journalism club th.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th.

the complaint in this action was based on filing of the lawsuit.that complaint was filed against mehrban for contriving the lawsuit for retribution because jsj prevailed in the lawsuit.the complaint arose from protected activity and is a proper subject of a motion made pursuant to the statute.
probability of prevailing on merits 
mehrban contends that jsj failed to meet its burden of demonstrating a likelihood 
it would prevail on the merits of its claims for abuse of process and malicious prosecution.we agree.
abuse of process 
the common law tort of abuse of process arises when one uses the court process for a purpose other than that for which the process was designed.rusheen cohen,supra,cal th at.to succeed in an action for abuse of process,a litigant must establish that the defendant contemplated an ulterior motive in using the process,and committed a willful act in the use of the process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceedings.id.at.

jsj cites booker rountree th,contending that the litigation privilege does not apply to bar a cause of action based on noncommunicative conduct.unlike in booker,however,the complaint here is based on a communicative act the complaint in the lawsuit.the complaint is not based,as in booker,on the noncommunicative act of refraining from filing a claim in order to prosecute successive lawsuits.as noted above,jsj alleged the complaint was filed against mehrban for contriving the lawsuit because mehrban is being sued for filing the lawsuit against jsj,the litigation privilege,subd.b forecloses the pursuit of the abuse of process cause of action.daniels robbins th.
jsj also contends that it filed its complaint because the lawsuit was filed for an improper purpose essentially to extort a settlement.the relevant california authorities establish,however,that while a defendant act of improperly instituting or maintaining an action may,in an appropriate case,give rise to a cause of action for malicious prosecution,the mere filing or maintenance of a lawsuit even for an improper purpose is not a proper basis for an abuse of process action.citations.oren royal oaks venture greenberg,bernhard,weiss karma,cal d.plaintiffs abuse of process claim is based on the allegation that defendants misused the litigation process by filing a frivolous lawsuit.accordingly,jsj has failed to carry its burden of a probability of success with regard to the abuse of process claim.contemporary services staff pro,supra,th at.
