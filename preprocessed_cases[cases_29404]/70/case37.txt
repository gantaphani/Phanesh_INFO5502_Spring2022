pursuant to its inherent powers to issue sanctions for conduct undertaken in bad faith,the district court found one party to a settlement deserving of sanctions and ordered it to pay in attorneys fees and costs.that party,cooperativa de seguros de vida de puerto rico cosvi,foolishly had filed a token opposition to the sanctions motion filed by its opponent,fac.only when the court allowed sanctions did cosvi belatedly produce,on motion for reconsideration,evidence and argument that its conduct was a reasonable interpretation of its settlement obligations.the district court,in our view,was justified in not giving weight to the belated evidence and argument that sanctions were inappropriate.
still,the court could not issue a sanctions order unless fac had met its burden of showing cosvi had acted in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly,or for oppressive reasons.chambers nasco,d quoting alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d.the court was bound by this court prior opinion in,cooperativa de seguros de vida de puerto rico i,cir.
the court gave four reasons in support of its finding that cosvi acted in bad faith.we find three of the four to have been erroneous,and need not reach the fourth.first,the court relied on cosvi initial delay in writing a letter acknowledging fraud,which the district court found to be in violation of its obligations under an oral settlement agreement.however,as we held in i,it was unclear that the terms of the settlement included an obligation on cosvi to write such a letter.while we affirmed the district court finding that such a letter was compelled by the settlement agreement,i,at,our discussion of the question showed that the settlement terms were unclear on this point.second,the district court concluded that cosvi disobeyed the court order to write the letter.in fact,cosvi obtained a stay of the order pending appeal and wrote the letter promptly at the conclusion of its unsuccessful efforts to appeal.nor was there a basis for the court finding that five years of protracted litigation delays were attributable to cosvi bad faith the major part of this delay resulted from the lack of clarity of the unwritten terms of settlement,and most of the remainder of the delay resulted from cosvi reasonable decision to appeal on a close question.we also hold that cosvi appeal,which led to our earlier opinion in i,was not undertaken in bad faith and that there was prompt compliance with the district court order once it was affirmed in the i appeal.these holdings undercut the primary bases for the sanctions award.we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the factual background of this case is described in id.at.briefly stated,fac is a consulting firm that contracted with the puerto rico department of health to recover from a federal agency unreimbursed or medicare claims,in exchange for a percentage of the recovery.cosvi is a fiscal intermediary which evaluates medicare claims on behalf of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,the federal agency ultimately responsible for payment.cms is within the department of health and human services.on may,fac sued cosvi and six of its officers under rico,a,d,and puerto rico law for allegedly attempting to extort funds in exchange for favorable action by cosvi on reimbursement requests fac had made.
at issue in part was whether any fraud alleged extortion demands by cosvi assistant vice president andres rodriguez which occurred was the responsibility of cosvi.the parties orally settled the case on april,the third day of trial.they agree that the settlement obligated cosvi to write a letter to cms in connection with fac reopening requests.the sanctions order stems from a disagreement,later raised,over what the letter was required to say.the language was important because cms will not reopen claims older than three years unless it is established that the determination or decision was procured by fraud or similar fault of any party to the determination or decision.b then codified at id.d.
cosvi sent a letter to cms on may,that said,t his request is based on facts learned by cosvi as a result of its litigation with fac,and pursuant to cfr section d.this was an oblique reference to the fraud language of the regulation.cosvi was interested in avoiding any admission that it had responsibility for fraud on june,cms sent cosvi a letter stating that it refused to reopen the claims.
starting in may,fac began to protest that cosvi was not meeting its obligations under the settlement agreement.fac and cosvi each filed motions in the district court seeking enforcement of the settlement agreement in may and june respectively.fac alleged that cosvi had not made the settlement payment to fac as agreed and had not complied with other terms set forth in a letter from fac counsel,while cosvi sought to compel fac to dismiss claims it had brought in state court.cosvi wrote a second letter on july,that went no further in its admissions but again mentioned d.that too did not procure reopening from cms.on august,the court entered an amended final judgment,noting that it had actively participated in the settlement discussions and that it understood the agreements reached to include t he sending of a letter by cosvi to cms,on behalf of fac,requesting the reopening of the medicare part a reimbursement claims.the court amended judgment also compelled fac to dismiss the state lawsuit.no party appealed and the sums cosvi had deposited for the settlement were paid out.
in,cms apparently was given information about an fbi investigation into the kickbacks.in late,fac filed motions to reopen the case.see i,at.fac argument was that the settlement required cosvi itself to reopen the claims and that the court should order cosvi to show cause why it had not done so.the court entered an order on september,denying all pending motions because it considered all claims disposed of due to the parties settlement.
fac filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that cosvi was in breach of the settlement agreement because it had not fully informed cms that fraud had occurred within cosvi.
on august,the court held that cosvi may letter had failed to satisfy the settlement obligations because it was silent on the reasons for the request for reopening.it ordered cosvi to send a new letter to cms and required that letter to include the following sentence it has come to our attention that fraudulent activities took place within our organization with regards to the claims at issue,and,pursuant to cfr section a and d,we request that you reopen and reassess the claims in question due to a finding of fraud or similar fault.this was the first time there was an order from the court that cosvi use specific language in its letter and that the language specifically admit there was fraud within cosvi.cosvi appealed,and was granted a stay of the district court order pending appeal.
on may,this court affirmed the order in i.we first addressed the question of whether the district court had jurisdiction to enter the order and concluded that while the court participation in the april settlement did not provide a basis for continuing jurisdiction,its august amended judgment,which incorporated the terms of the parties agreement and demonstrated an intention to retain jurisdiction,did.i,at citing kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d.
turning to the merits of the order to cosvi,we held that some deference was due to the district court views and the district judge assessment of cosvi obligation is reasonable and more likely right than wrong.id.at.we noted,however,that fac case for its reading is hardly air tight,id.at,for several reasons.a term sheet that the parties had circulated during settlement negotiations made no mention of a letter.further,fac did not protest after cosvi sent its initial letter,which fac later said was inadequate.see id.cosvi filed a petition for certiorari seeking review of i,which the supreme court denied on december,d.
less than two weeks after the denial of certiorari,on december,cosvi sent a letter to cms consisting entirely of the language.cms again declined to reopen the claims.
