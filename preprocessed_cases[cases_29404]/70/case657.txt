factual and procedural background 
plaintiff,san diegans for open government sdog,describes itself as a nonprofit organization acting as a government watchdog to ensure public agencies comply with all applicable laws aimed at promoting transparency and accountability in government.defendants are the city of san diego city and jan goldsmith,the san diego city attorney together defendants.sdog submitted a public records request to city for all communications pertaining to city official business sent to or from goldsmith personal account during certain time periods.city refused to produce any communications,stating they did not qualify as public records.sdog filed this verified action after confirming city would not produce any responsive records.the operative pleading claimed a violation of the act and sought declaratory relief against defendants to compel disclosure of the.sdog also alleged a cause of action under section for taxpayer waste.
sdog ultimately dismissed the waste cause of action with prejudice.the trial court issued a judgment in favor of sdog on its claim under the act and granted sdog declaratory relief against city.third party,league of california cities,subsequently petitioned this court for a writ of mandate under the act challenging the trial court order.we granted the petition and remanded the matter for further proceedings.league of california cities superior court th the prior action.on remand,the trial court determined sdog to be the prevailing party under the act and awarded it attorney fees and costs.the court also denied city request for sanctions under section.city timely appealed both orders.
discussion 
isanctionsa.background 
defendants sought sanctions on the ground sdog had no evidence to support its waste cause of action,sdog sole piece of evidence was invented,and soon after filing the claim sdog started a publicity campaign against goldsmith to wrongfully leverage a settlement.sdog opposed the motion,arguing it was procedurally defective and sdog counsel believed in good faith the waste cause of action had merit.the trial court denied the motion finding the waste cause of action was not completely devoid of legal merit because the claim survived demurrer defendants provide d no evidence demonstrating that a useless expenditure of public funds did not actually take place and defendants speculated,but provided no evidence,sdog counsel acted in bad faith.
procedural issues 
sdog contends we should affirm the trial court order denying city request for sanctions because the motion was procedurally defective.sdog argues section does not apply to this action because it was not in effect when sdog filed the operative pleading.sdog also argued below that defendants did not comply with the safe harbor waiting period of section as required by section,subdivision f,but sdog did not pursue this issue on appeal.under government code section,we requested additional briefing from the parties on the proper interpretation of section,subdivision f,and how this impacted defendants sanctions motion.the parties submitted additional briefing as requested.

in,the legislature proposed revising and reviving former section to provide an additional tool by which courts may potentially sanction bad faith actions or tactics.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended april.the legislature enacted the current version of section,effective january.see cal,art.iv,subd.c absent urgency clause,a statute enacted at a regular session of the legislature becomes effective on january of the following year.the substantive provisions of former section and section are virtually identical.compare,subds.a,b,c d and former,subds.a,b,c d.the current version of section contains three additional provisions stating it does not apply to discovery disclosures and motions,subd.e providing any sanctions imposed must be imposed consistently with the standards,conditions,and procedures set forth in subdivisions c,d and h of section,subd.f and imposing reporting obligations,subds.e,f h.these three additional provisions will be repealed on january,unless a statute deletes or extends that date,subd.i see stats,ch.
sdog contends section does not apply because sdog filed this action and dismissed its waste cause of action in,before the effective date of the statute.sdog asserts applying section under these circumstances amounts to improper retroactive application of the statute to past conduct.

in arguing section should not apply,sdog relies on the presumption that statutes apply prospectively in the absence of a clearly expressed contrary intent evangelatos superior court cal d.assuming,for the sake of argument,the legislature did not make its intent clear,we examine sdog contention.
a statute establishing rules for the conduct of pending litigation without changing the legal consequences of past conduct is not retroactive merely because it draws on facts existing prior to its enactment rather,such statutes are actually prospective in nature because they relate to the procedure to be followed in the future.californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,see also republic superior court d,olson hickman d.no litigant has a vested right in any matter of procedure.national auto.cas.ins.downey d.
statutory enactments allowing an award of attorney fees made after the occurrence of an event and during the pendency of legal proceedings are properly characterized as an ancillary provision,creating no new cause of action.it is procedural only.a lawsuit is governed by a change in procedural rules made during its pendency,and the suit is pending until its final determination on appeal.olson hickman,supra,d at.a motion for sanctions,like a motion for attorney fees,is a matter collateral to the underlying litigation.san bernardino community hospital meeks d.nothing in section impacts the rights or liabilities of the parties regarding the claims at issue in sdog complaint.rather,section operates prospectively because it is a procedural statute governing the conduct of proceedings following its enactment to determine the legal significance of past events,whether these past events make the moving party eligible for sanctions.
sdog next contends defendants did not comply with the safe harbor waiting period of section as required by section,subdivision f,which states a ny sanctions imposed pursuant to this section shall be imposed consistently with the standards,conditions,and procedures set forth in subdivisions c,d,and h of section.before addressing this question we briefly review each subdivision of section mentioned in section.
section,subdivision h,provides a motion for sanctions brought for an improper purpose is itself subject to a motion for sanctions.section,subdivision d,authorizes monetary and nonmonetary sanctions limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of this conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.monetary sanctions can be fines payable to the court or an award to the moving party for reasonable attorney fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation,subd.d.section,subdivision c,provides sanctions may be awarded against attorneys,law firms,or parties.subdivision c describes a procedure for a section sanction motion.the moving party serves the sanctions motion on the offending party without filing it.the opposing party then has days to withdraw or correct the improper pleading and avoid sanctions the safe harbor waiting period.at the end of the waiting period,if the pleading is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected,the moving party may then file the motion,subd.c martorana marlin saltzman th.section,subdivision c,allows a court,on its own motion,to enter an order describing the specific conduct that appears to violate subdivision b and directing an attorney,law firm,or party to show cause why it has not violated subdivision b,unless,within days of service of the order to show cause,the challenged paper,claim,defense,contention,allegation,or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected.
we are not persuaded by sdog contention that a party seeking sanctions under section must comply with the safe harbor waiting period in section,subdivision c.sdog argument requires us to interpret the language of section.section,subdivision f,requires sanctions be imposed consistently with the standards,conditions,and procedures set forth in subdivisions c,d,and h of section.italics added.the plain language of the statute specifies sanctions are to be imposed consistently with section,subdivision c,pertaining to who can be sanctioned and whether the party seeking sanctions exercised due diligence.the legislature did not specify motions under section needed to be imposed consistently with the safe harbor provisions of section,subdivisions c and c.
to the extent section can be considered ambiguous regarding adoption of the safe harbor provisions of section,subdivisions c and c,our review of the legislative history reveals no mention of the section safe harbor waiting period.it is inconceivable the legislature intended to incorporate by reference a prerequisite filing requirement without mentioning the requirement.finally,section is limited to misconduct in the filing or advocacy of groundless claims made in signed pleadings and other papers,subd.b.the purpose of the safe harbor waiting period contained in section is to allow a party to avoid sanctions by withdrawing or otherwise appropriately correcting the offending paper,claim,defense,contention,allegation,or denial.barnes department of corrections th.section is not limited to misconduct made in signed pleadings and other papers,subd.a.as a practical matter,requiring a party to comply with the safe harbor waiting period of section before filing a sanctions motion under section makes little sense as the waiting period can not be used to withdraw or appropriately correct past actions or tactics,subd.c.
we conclude a party filing a sanctions motion under section does not need to comply with the safe harbor waiting period described in section,subdivision c.
legal standard 
defendants contend the trial court applied an improper legal standard when it denied the sanctions motion.
both the former and current versions of section give a trial court discretion to award reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay,subd.a former,subd.a.actions or tactics include the making or opposing of motions or the filing and service of a complaint or.former,subd.b.the current version of section broadened the definition of an action or tactic to include the filing and service of an answer or other responsive pleading,subd.b.frivolous means a totally and completely without merit or b for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing party,subd.b former,subd.b.
former section is silent on whether an objective or subjective standard applies to determine whether actions or tactics are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.the subjective standard evaluates the motives of a party or counsel and the objective standard looks at the merits from a reasonable person perspective.in re marriage of flaherty cal d.many courts interpreting former section required a showing of subjective bad faith in addition to frivolousness.shelton rancho mortgage investment th,listing cases.
section is similarly silent on whether an objective or subjective standard applies.the question presented is whether the legislature intended section to be interpreted similar to former section.our review of the legislative history shows one purpose of section was to eliminate the subjective standard and impose an objective standard.
the author of the bill explained the bar for the imposition of sanctions under section was considered to be too high because the statute had been interpreted to require both an objective standard that the act was without merit and a subjective motive,which was difficult to prove.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.
