imran qurashi qurashi appeals from a january,order of restitution entered by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york sandra feuerstein,judge following his guilty plea to a indictment charging him with insurance fraud.qurashi argues that the district court abused its discretion by including prejudgment interest in the restitution awarded to the defrauded insurers.we affirm the district court judgment and hold that prejudgment interest can be awarded in a criminal restitution order to ensure that a victim losses are fully compensated.we reject qurashi argument that he was prejudiced by the district court failure to determine the victims losses within the statutory window.finally,we remand to allow the district court to conform the statement of reasons supporting the sentence to qurashi stipulation with the government.
background 
qurashi twice faked his brother death to collect millions of dollars in life insurance proceeds it was only after the second time that he was caught.in and,qurashi and his brother,adnan qurashi adnan,purchased two million life insurance policies on adnan life from the metropolitan life insurance company metlife and new york life insurance company new york life.in,qurashi submitted claims to both companies that falsely asserted that adnan had died in a car accident in pakistan.the following year,the insurers paid qurashi more than million on the policies.
adnan,still very much alive,returned to the united states from pakistan in november,whereupon he assumed a new identity as qurashi fictitious cousin hassan khan.flushed with success,qurashi upped the ante between and,he purchased eight million life insurance policies on hassan khan life from four insurance companies.history repeated itself in hassan khan was purportedly killed in a traffic accident in pakistan,and qurashi falsely claimed proceeds on all eight policies.this time,however,the insurance companies refused to pay and opened investigations.
an indictment returned on june,charged qurashi and adnan with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and eight counts of mail fraud.adnan remains a fugitive.after qurashi entered a guilty plea,district judge sandra feuerstein sentenced him in october to concurrent imprisonment terms of months on the conspiracy charge and months on the mail fraud charges,plus three years of supervised release.judge feuerstein deferred the determination of restitution,at the government request,to allow time to ensure that every insurance company had been accounted for.qurashi agreed to waive his right to appeal the sentence as long as the sentence is months or less.the government concedes,however,that because qurashi waiver referred only to the prison term,it does not bar this appeal from the restitution order.
on january,the government submitted a proposed order of restitution,to which qurashi objected.judge feuerstein referred the determination of restitution to magistrate judge kathleen tomlinson,who held a hearing and issued a report and recommendation.the district court adopted the report and recommendation,and rejected qurashi objections.judge feuerstein entered judgment and signed a statement of reasons regarding qurashi sentence on january,and shortly thereafter overruled qurashi objection that the restitution order was untimely.the order included prejudgment interest at a rate of percent.this appeal,confined to the restitution order,followed.
discussion 
qurashi argues that the district court erred by including prejudgment interest in its restitution award to new york life and metlife.because the insurers failed to demonstrate how their money would have been used if it had not been paid out to qurashi,he contends that prejudgment interest compensates the insurers for more than their actual losses.qurashi further claims that he was prejudiced by the district court failure to comply with a statutory deadline for determining the victims losses.

prejudgment interest 
in february,metlife paid qurashi on adnan life insurance policy,and new york life paid qurashi the following month on a similar policy.the district court ordered restitution of those insurance payments,which qurashi had obtained both by overstating his and adnan net worth when he purchased the policies and by submitting a fraudulent death certificate to verify adnan purported death.the restitution order also required qurashi to pay prejudgment interest on those sums at percent to compensate the insurers for the loss of the use of their money.qurashi argues that the district court erred in awarding prejudgment interest.he does not,however,challenge the rate,other than to note that the rate claimed was less than the rate of return on portfolio investment.
the mandatory victims restitution act mvra requires that a defendant convicted of specific offenses in which an identifiable victim or victims has suffered a pecuniary loss be ordered to make restitution to the victim.a,c.the defendant must pay an amount equal to the greater of the value of the property on the date of the loss or on the date of sentencing,less the value as of the date the property is returned of any part of the property that is returned.id.b b.in each order of restitution,the court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.id.f a.
qurashi appeal poses a question of first impression in this circuit whether a criminal restitution order may include prejudgment interest.in a summary order,we recently affirmed a district court inclusion of lost investment returns in a restitution order.united states scott,app x cir.the defendant in scott had stolen money from three retirement accounts,two of which would have increased in value by the date of the sentencing had the assets remained in those accounts.id.at.it was also apparent that the funds would have remained in those accounts but for the theft.id.given those facts,we concluded that the actual value of the stolen property,the funds in the retirement accounts,at the time of sentencing was the nominal value of the stolen funds plus the subsequent investment gains lost as a result of the theft,which meant the district court had appropriately included in the restitution award the investment earnings that would have accrued as of the date of sentencing.id.
the mvra requires sentencing courts to order restitution of the property value on the date of sentencing if that figure is greater than the property value on the date of loss.b b.the district court in scott did so by calculating the value that the affected investment accounts would have reached as of the sentencing date had the money not been stolen.see scott,app x at.in this case,metlife and new york life did not document what would have happened to the insurance proceeds they paid to qurashi.although both requested prejudgment interest and supported those requests with affidavits of company officials,neither made any representations as to how their money would have been used absent qurashi fraud.the funds were not,as in scott,stolen from specific investment accounts whose gains and losses between the date of the fraud and the date of the sentencing could be tracked.
qurashi argues that the absence of tracking is a fatal flaw.prejudgment interest is only appropriate,he contends,where a victim had a contractual right to interest on the funds at issue.absent a showing as to what metlife and new york life would have done with the money that went to qurashi,he argues,the district court erred in awarding prejudgment interest on that amount.ordinary prejudgment interest,in qurashi view,amounts to an award of expectation damages and therefore exceeds the proper scope
