facts background 
like many law students,hann financed her legal education partially through student loans.those loans included three federally insured stafford loans of each in total,executed on may,april,and may,respectively.the loans were originally issued by society bank and subsequently assigned to ecmc.hann contends that she eventually repaid these loans in full,and says that,in the years leading up to her chapter filing,she unsuccessfully tried to get various financial institutions including ecmc itself to acknowledge or verify that fact.
in november,hann filed her chapter petition in the bankruptcy court for the district of new hampshire.three months later,ecmc filed an unsecured proof of claim in the amount of in principal,in interest,and in collection costs.ecmc proof of claim included copies of the three stafford loan promissory notes which,as noted,totaled,not,in principal.hann objected to ecmc claim,contending that ecmc had failed to file adequate supporting documentation,that hann had received conflicting information from ecmc about the outstanding loan amount,and that hann records showed payments in excess of original loan amounts.she therefore asked the bankruptcy court to disallow the claim or,alternatively,to allow the claim in the amount proven by appropriate payment records.
the bankruptcy court held a hearing on hann objection.ecmc neither appeared at the hearing nor responded to the objection.at the hearing,hann testified at length about her payment history and her efforts to reconcile her own records with her lenders records.the court then instructed hann to supplement her testimony with an affidavit clearly outlining her loans and payments,which she did.the affidavit stated hann belief that she had repaid the stafford loans in full and described her dealings with ecmc and its predecessors,including the fact that in,she received correspondence from society bank indicating the stafford notes had been paid.hann submitted copies of that correspondence,which appeared to support her position.
after receiving hann materials,the bankruptcy court sustained hann objection by entering an order the claim order that read debtor objection to claim filed by ecmc is sustained.this court allows the claim of ecmc in the amount of.per the common practice in the bankruptcy courts,the claim order had been drafted by hann counsel and submitted to the court as a proposed order.the claim order did not include any specific factual findings or legal conclusions.ecmc did not appeal or otherwise respond to the order 
after hann chapter case ended in,ecmc resumed its efforts to collect on hann loans.in response,hann lawyer wrote to ecmc to assert,based on the claim order,that ecmc has no further claim against hann.when ecmc refused to desist,hann reopened her bankruptcy case and filed an adversary complaint against ecmc,seeking injunctive and declaratory relief barring ecmc from continuing its collection efforts,a finding of contempt,actual and punitive damages,and fees and costs.
the parties for summary judgment as to liability in september.the bankruptcy judge who previously presided over the case having retired,the case was assigned to a new judge,who held a hearing on the parties motions in october.at the hearing,ecmc argued that,although the claim order had disallowed ecmc claim against hann bankruptcy estate,it did not adjudicate the amount owing on her student loan debt or discharge that debt within the meaning of the bankruptcy code because student loan debt is typically nondischargeable under a.for her part,hann contended that the claim order established that,as a factual matter,hann had paid her debt in full prior to the bankruptcy,leaving nothing to discharge.
the bankruptcy court agreed with hann,concluding that the claim order reflected the prior judge determination that the obligation remaining on ecmc claim was zero.the court also noted ecmc repeated inability to identify or quantify an outstanding debt obligation.the court thus granted hann motion for summary judgment as to liability and denied ecmc.hann then waived her remaining claims and,at the court direction,submitted an affidavit of fees and costs,to which ecmc objected.the court entered final judgment for hann,ordering that she owes nothing to the defendant and awarding her costs and fees as a remedial sanction for ecmc violation of the bankruptcy code discharge injunction.see a creating an automatic injunction against efforts intended to collect an already discharged debt.
ecmc appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel bap,which affirmed.hann educ.credit mgmt.in re hann,cir.the bap said that the key issue was not whether the debt was dischargeable,but instead whether ecmc claim was disallowed on the grounds of payment in full.id.at.if so,discharge was irrelevant because there is no need to except from discharge a debt which no longer exists.id.citation and emphasis omitted.having framed the issue that way,the bap ascribed critical importance to the fact that hann had objected to ecmc claim on the ground that she had already repaid the debt in full.that fact,in combination with the bankruptcy court thorough review of the claim objection and the claim,persuaded the bap that the bankruptcy court found that there was no obligation remaining on the loans as of the petition date.id.accordingly,the bap affirmed the award of sanctions,explaining that ecmc continued collection activities in the face of the claim order constituted an abuse of the bankruptcy process and defiance of the court authority.id.at.ecmc now appeals the bap decision.
ii.analysis 
two concepts feature prominently in the parties arguments claim allowance or disallowance,which deals exclusively with the rights of a creditor against assets of a debtor bankruptcy estate and dischargeability,which concerns whether a creditor may,after the entry of bankruptcy discharge,continue to pursue the enforcement of its debt as a personal liability against the debtor.gregory dep t of educ.in re gregory.dischargeability,however,is not really at issue here.ecmc says that the bap mistook the disallowance of ecmc claim for a discharge,and thus erroneously held that an order disallowing a chapter claim necessarily discharges an underlying nondischargeable debt.but the bap said no such thing.rather,it concluded that the issue in this case is not whether a nondischargeable debt can be discharged by virtue of its disallowance,but whether there is a debt at all where the claim has been disallowed on the grounds of payment in full.at emphasis added and ecmc now agrees that a claim disallowance order can dissolve an underlying nondischargeable debt if it is based on a factual finding that the debt has been repaid ecmc just disputes whether that actually happened in this case.thus,the key question here is simply whether the claim order disallowed ecmc claim on the ground that hann had already repaid her loans in which case dischargeability is beside the point.we consider that legal question de novo.see sharfarz goguen in re goguen,cir monarch life ins.ropes gray,cir.we then address the issue of sanctions 
a.the claim order 
ecmc insists that the claim order did not determine that hann had repaid her student loans,but merely ruled that ecmc could not collect anything from the bankruptcy estate that is,it disallowed the claim,and nothing more.as ecmc sees it,there is a crucial difference between a claim disallowance order saying hann owes nothing or ecmc is owed nothing and one saying as the claim order actually does that ecmc claim is allowed in the amount of.the latter,ecmc says,does not purport to adjudicate the amount of the underlying debt.thus,ecmc contends that the claim order means only that its claim was disallowed,which should not prevent ecmc from pursuing an outstanding nondischargeable student loan debt.ecmc also warns that requiring courts to interpret unelaborated claim disallowance orders like this one in order to determine whether they ruled that the underlying debt was satisfied would thrust those courts into a subjective analytical quagmire.
hann response is the same as it was below that she objected to ecmc claim on the ground that she had paid off her loans,and then presented evidence to that effect,prompting the bankruptcy court to rule albeit in oblique language that she had indeed satisfied her debts.in response to ecmc argument about the pitfalls of deciphering an unexplained claim disallowance order,hann posits that the task is fairly straightforward where,as here,the debtor provided the ordering judge with substantial and unrebutted evidence that the debt has been paid 
at the outset,we can agree with ecmc that it is far better for bankruptcy courts that disallow claims on the ground that the underlying debt is satisfied to say so in clear language.we think this case would not be before us if the claim order simply said ecmc claim is disallowed because the underlying loans have been repaid.but the onus of avoiding ambiguity in these situations does not rest solely with bankruptcy judges.the claim order was submitted by hann counsel as a proposed order had hann counsel proposed clearer language,this entire second proceeding most likely would have been unnecessary.
nevertheless,we do not agree with ecmc that an inquiry into the reasoning behind the claim order is unworkable.we have said before that when a court order phraseology is imprecise,there may be some play in the joints.for example,a reviewing court can comb relevant parts of the record to discern the authoring court intention.negrón almeda santiago,cir accord r g mortg.fed.home loan mortg.corp,cir see subsalve usa watson,cir construing an unclear order in light of the record of the proceedings below.these cases dealt with orders that came to us on direct appeal,but there are also times when we look to the record in a prior proceeding,as when we must determine what issues were actually decided for preclusion purposes,miller nichols,cir hoult hoult,cir see charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure jurisdiction,at ed the first step in identifying issues decided in a prior case is a painstaking examination of the record of the prior action.to be sure,when the option is available,the wisest course will often be to vacate the ambiguous order and return the case to the authoring court for clarification.subsalve usa,at.here,though,we can not take that route because the claim order was not appealed from,and clarification would be unavailable anyway because the ordering judge has retired.indeed,that fact prevented the bankruptcy court itself from simply clarifying the claim order had the ordering judge been available to preside over the adversary proceeding,he could have made the order scope clear.under these circumstances,we deem it appropriate to comb relevant parts of the record to discern the authoring court intention.negrón almeda,at.
our scrutiny establishes that the claim order was indeed based on the conclusion that hann had repaid her loans.this situation is not unlike one where we must determine whether a factual issue was a necessary component of an unexplained judgment or a general jury verdict in an earlier case.for example,in hoult,we concluded,on the basis of the arguments made and the evidence presented,that the jury had necessarily decided a particular question that was the centerpiece,the central and pivotal issue,in the initial trial.at.here,hann claim that she had repaid her loans in full had at least that status,given that it was her central if not sole argument against ecmc claim and there is no dispute that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to determine that the debt underlying the claim had been repaid.see langenkamp culp,d b y filing a claim against a bankruptcy estate the creditor triggers the process of allowance and disallowance of claims,thereby subjecting himself to the bankruptcy court equitable power.citation omitted.
hann explained,during her testimony and in her subsequent affidavit,that she believe d the student loan claims were paid in full prior to the commencement of the chapter proceeding.she submitted materials appearing to support that belief.her arguments and documentation went unrebutted.the bankruptcy court questioned hann in person,reviewed her supplemental materials,and sustained her objection.as in hoult,it may be t heoretically possible that the claim order is based on some conclusion other than repayment,but it is not plausible.id.at.perhaps matters would be different if ecmc had disputed the issue,or simply appeared at the hearing to offer a basis for its claim.but,given what actually happened during the claim objection process,it is clear that,as the bap put it,the bankruptcy court in disallowing the claim,necessarily determined that it had,in fact,been paid in full.at.
the fact that hann squarely raised the issue of whether she had repaid her loans distinguishes this case from state of florida department of revenue diaz in re diaz,cir,on which ecmc relies.in diaz,the debtor objected to a proof of claim for unpaid child support on the basis that the documentation offered by the state in support of the claim showed erroneously,it turned out that the debt was roughly less than the amount stated in the proof of claim itself.id.at.the state did not respond to the objection,and so the bankruptcy court sustained it,allowing the claim in the lesser amount.when the state later resumed its collection efforts,the bankruptcy court ruled that doing so violated the discharge injunction.the eleventh circuit reversed,explaining that the debt was nondischargeable,id.at,and that in any event the amount of the debt was never litigated during the underlying bankruptcy proceedings,because the only issue before the bankruptcy court at the time of the claim objection was the amount of the debt that would be paid by the bankruptcy estate through diaz chapter plan,not the total amount of the debt,id.at.here,although the ultimate issue in the claim objection hearing was the same as in diaz,the amount the creditor would get from the estate,that issue was resolved by way of a subsidiary factual issue not raised in diaz whether the debt had already been repaid.hoult,at.thus,diaz addressed a different situation 
b.the sanctions
