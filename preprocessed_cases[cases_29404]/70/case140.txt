this appeal is from sanctions imposed by the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer,upon the law firm of dorsey whitney,llp dorsey,and two of its partners kristan peters no longer with the firm and marc reiner.in the underlying litigation,dorsey client wolters kluwer financial services,wolters sued four of its former employees in the southern district of new york,alleging that they had taken certain proprietary information and divulged it to their new employer,the technology company scivantage.after considerable discovery conducted under orders of confidentiality,dorsey voluntarily dismissed the suit and a substantially identical suit in the district of massachusetts scivantage having contested personal jurisdiction in the southern district of new york.dorsey then filed a motion in the massachusetts action seeking injunctive relief and attaching some of the discovery material produced by defendants in new york.following a hearing into the voluntary dismissal and the use of the discovery material as well as other issues the new york district court issued a opinion imposing sanctions on dorsey,peters,reiner,and their client.wolters has not appealed.we affirm the imposition of sanctions on peters in light of the abundance of evidence of her misconduct but we reverse the sanctions imposed on dorsey and reiner.
although the sanctions are,the district court respected the reputational impact of sanctions,and made detailed findings that allow disposition on appeal without remand.see wolters kluwer financial services scivantage et,d opinion order.we adduce only those facts necessary to explain the disposition of this appeal.
dorsey filed suit on behalf of wolters in march,alleging federal and state violations,and seeking injunctive relief.the district court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered expedited discovery.the parties exchanged discovery documents,and the individual defendants were deposed while discovery was ongoing,the district court entered a confidentiality order providing in part that certain all discovery material at issue here shall not be used in any other litigation proceeding,and that the district court jurisdiction to enforce those restrictions would survive the lawsuit.
defendants moved to dismiss on the ground inter alia that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants,all of them located in massachusetts.the dorsey attorneys then began to consider voluntary dismissal in new york and in the district of massachusetts.wolters gave peters permission to dismiss the suit.during a subsequent conference call with the court and opposing counsel,however,peters did not mention the pending dismissal.either during or shortly after the conference call,peters the partner in charge instructed reiner the junior partner on the case to file the dismissal reiner sent notice of the dismissal by regular not electronically.
despite the dismissal,peters refused to return the discovery material produced by defendants,including three cds containing pages of documents that were produced after the dismissal had been quietly effected.despite repeated orders by the district court to return all discovery material,including copies of deposition transcripts,the return of discovery material was not completed until two weeks after the suit was dismissed.in the meantime,peters filed a motion for temporary injunctive relief in the district of massachusetts,appending pages of material produced in new york that were subject to the confidentiality order.
defendants moved for sanctions,and the district court scheduled an evidentiary hearing.the parties subsequently settled,and the defendants withdrew the sanctions motion but the court,having its own concerns regarding the lawyers conduct,proceeded with the hearing.ultimately,the court imposed a total of sanctions on dorsey,peters,and reiner,and their client.the firm and the individual lawyers appeal.
we review a district court imposition of sanctions for abuse of discretion.schlaifer nance estate of warhol,cir.the reviewing court must ensure that the district court sanctions are not based on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.id.internal quotation marks omitted.an assessment of the evidence is clearly erroneous where the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.zervos verizon new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted.and the imposition of sanctions is also improper where it can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.id.at.
these familiar principles notwithstanding,we bear in mind that when the district court is accuser,fact finder and sentencing judge all in one,schlaifer,at internal quotation marks omitted,our review is more exacting than under the ordinary standard,perez danbury,cir.imposition of sanctions under a court inherent powers requires a specific finding that an attorney acted in bad faith.schlaifer,at.moreover,sanctions are appropriate only if there is clear evidence that the conduct at issue is entirely without color and motivated by improper purposes.id.at.conduct is entirely without color when it lacks any legal or factual basis it is colorable when it has some legal and factual support,considered in light of the reasonable beliefs of the attorney whose conduct is at issue.id.at.a finding of bad faith,and a finding that conduct is without color or for an improper purpose,must be supported by a high degree of specificity in the factual findings.eisemann greene,cir per curiam.
the district court imposed two sanctions on dorsey whitney as a firm one for voluntarily dismissing the wolters kluwer suit in the southern district,and one for using the deposition transcripts in the massachusetts action.both sanctions must be overturned.
voluntary dismissal 
the district court found that dorsey main purpose in filing a rule voluntary dismissal of the wolters litigation was to in order to conceal from its client deficiencies in counsel advocacy that had been noted by the district judge in new york.the district court reasoned that this sort of was an improper purpose and was accordingly sanctionable.
in seeking reversal of the sanction,dorsey advances two arguments the district court finding that dorsey lawyers acted with an improper purpose was not accompanied by a finding that the firm itself acted in bad faith and the conduct itself is not sanctionable because the rule dismissal was not entirely without color.we agree with dorsey on both grounds.
with regard to bad faith,the only passage in the district court opinion touching on culpability of the firm itself is in a footnote to its conclusion,in which the court wrote that the firm culpability stems not only from peters,but also from the firm inability to adequately supervise its attorneys,as well as its decision to leave peters in charge of the litigation while she was on vacation.this passage reflects that the district court imputed peters bad faith to dorsey because dorsey failed to prevent what she did.but we have held that b ad faith is personal and may not automatically be visited on others.browning debenture holders comm.dasa,cir.accordingly,absent other specific evidence of dorsey bad faith,a sanction under the court inherent power is unjustified.see milltex indus.jacquard lace,cir t he court factual findings of bad faith must be characterized by a high degree of specificity.internal quotation marks omitted.
with regard to the rule dismissal,a plaintiff who has not been served with an answer or motion for summary judgment has an unfettered right voluntarily and unilaterally to dismiss an action.thorp scarne,cir.dismissal of a suit may be disruptive and annoying,but it is permitted by the rules 
p laintiffs tend to dismiss actions that do not look promising while defendants generally want to obtain an adjudication on the merits in precisely the same cases.but as long as the plaintiff has brought himself within the requirements of rule,his reasons for wanting to do so are not for us to judge.
