introduction 
petitioner,nina ringgold,an attorney,seeks a writ of habeas corpus directing the respondent court to annul a june,order adjudging her in direct contempt of court.ringgold,the former trustee of a trust,was held in direct contempt of a june,oral order,issued in open court,to sign a document giving the current trustee access to trust property in a storage facility.the duty to sign the document arose from a prior december,order to cooperate and turn over documents,which would allow trust property to be distributed to beneficiaries.there are two written contempt june,minute order and a june,contempt order.the two written contempt orders do not mention the prior december,order.hence,the two june and,written orders fail to meet the jurisdictional requirements of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.as a result,the contempt orders are void.
ii.background 
ringgold is a beneficiary and former trustee of the aubry family trust.she was terminated as trustee by court order on march.myer sankary,an attorney,is the current trustee.apanius is an attorney who represents a trust beneficiary.
in november,sankary filed a supplement to a petition to determine certain distribution rights for additional distribution for instructions and partial payment of trustee fees.in addition sankary requested that ringgold be ordered to cooperate with respect to personal property in a storage unit.sankary declared apanius has informed me that her client is entitled to receive the property now held in a public storage facility in the name of nina ringgold,trustee of the aubry trust.a request has been made for nina ringgold to sign over all rights to access the storage facility containing the personal property this requires that nina ringgold meet with me at public storage to sign over the rights to the property.i request that the court issue an order compelling nina ringgold to cooperate with me and to meet with me at public storage to transfer to me all authority to access the storage room,so that the personal property belonging to apanius client and other beneficiaries can be distributed to them as soon as possible.
on november,a preliminary distribution of trust assets order was issued.a further order determining distribution rights was entered on december.the december,order included the following nina ringgold is ordered within hours to cooperate and forthwith turn over to myer sankary all documents and keys necessary to transfer possession of the personal property of the decedents robert aubry and mary aubry estate now located in the public storage facility.myer sankary is authorized to release the personal property to such beneficiaries of robert and mary aubry as are entitled to said property and in accordance with their agreement.as noted,this december,order served as the basis of the later order to sign a document.further,the december,order is not mentioned in the contempt orders which will be discussed.on december,ringgold filed a notice of appeal from the november and december,orders.in re aubry family trust.
the trust matter was called for a status conference on may.the following occurred apanius good morning,your honor.apanius,appearing on behalf of a trust beneficiary.raheb good morning,your honor.dory raheb i appearing on behalf of the attorney,nina ringgold.apanius t here is one matter that we would like to raise,and i discussed this with the trustee.san k ary is unable to appear here today.he had a medical problem and asked me to ask this,make this request of the court.in december,miss ringgold was ordered to turn over keys and sign off on a storage unit that she rented as trustee of the trust.judge richard kolostian ordered her to make that transfer within hours of his order,and she never cooperated and signed off on that.the trust is incurring expenses of approximately a month to store what we believe is just miscellaneous personal property owned by decedent robert aubry.miss ringgold accounted for that property and valued it at.this is turning into a complete waste of money as far as the trust is concerned,and we like to discontinue that storage unit and have miss ringgold sign off and get that property distributed to whomever it entitled to.my client is the beneficiary of robert aubry will,and she was the person to whom the property was bequeathed.she now deceased.she was never able to take possession of that property because of miss ringgold lack of cooperation on this.and what we like to do is just get the property or the storage unit turned over to the trustee.the trustee would like to inspect it,and then we like to offer the beneficiaries an opportunity to select whatever items they would like to have,and then any remaining property sold for the benefit of the trust or given to charity.and i have the document here.miss ringgold evidently is here to be able to sign off,you know,to transfer the storage unit,but if there any possibility you could make some sort of order to get her to sign that,that would really be beneficial to the trust.the court do you know anything about this raheb of course i do,your honor.diana williams a trust beneficiary i do.i just want to add,because it is,it a month they paying for storage,and it really stuff that is actually being destroyed because it been there since.the court why do we set an order to show cause re contempt for june.apanius okay.the court counsel,will you give notice apanius yes,i give notice.the court thank you very much.raheb thank you so much,your honor.
on may,the trial court issued an order to show cause re contempt and sanctions stating to nina ringgold good cause having been shown,you are ordered to appear in this court on june,to show cause why you should not be held in contempt for violating this court order of december,compelling you to cooperate and turn over to myer sankary,trustee of the aubry family trust,all documents and keys necessary to transfer possession of the personal property of decedents robert aubry and mary aubry located in a storage unit at public storage.the proceedings shall determine whether you may be punished under code of civil procedure,including petitioners attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with this contempt hearing.
ringgold appeared at the june,contempt hearing.no effort was made to proceed on the order to show cause.rather,the following transpired apanius well,your honor,you ordered the order to show cause and that had to do with the storage unit,and that really the only issue before the court.the court okay.refresh my recollection.apanius there is property in storage that been in storage for some time.miss ringgold accounted for it at a value of.what we trying to do is just get the storage unit turned over to the current trustee so that he can distribute the property and discontinue that expense.the court okay why did that happen apanius the storage unit will not authorize the turn over unless ringgold signs a document we asked her to sign it,the successor trustee has asked her,and she not done that.the court miss ringgold,why ca that happen ringgold your honor,i here procedurally and in a order to show cause that is not based on an affidavit,and since this been brought to court which under the assumption that i was here on a contempt charge,which does involve an affidavit.i really do feel comfortable responding to that because i being asked to respond,and i object to the procedure of being compelled by fax by counsel serving me with an order to show cause that does have an affidavit.i already indicated to this court.i appeared twice.this matter is a matter subject to the automatic stay.she presenting documents that i never seen.if there some issue about an order that they have a challenge about that on appeal,i would prefer that the the procedure they use,that they present an affidavit where it can be responded to,because i under the assumption here that i here on an order to show cause for contempt.the court i tell you what sign the document now.ringgold i do know what order or document we talking about,and i not going to sign a document that i do know what it is.the court you have three days grace before you get put in custody.ringgold okay.the court would you like to go that route ringgold would prefer to use procedures established by the code of civil procedure.the court i going to find you in contempt,sentence you to five days in jail.you get a stay,pursuant to the code,so that would be the.ringgold okay.the court so come up here on the of june ready to surrender for your five days.and you can cure that anytime you want by signing that document.ringgold i do know what this document is.today is for the court we through.ringgold i will cite to you the case of in re cowan,in which it was determined the court does not have jurisdiction the court ringgold i refuse to sign.the court see you on the.like i said,you can cure it anytime you want by signing it.ringgold what would i be curing,your honor the court you a very bright attorney.you can sign it.ringgold okay.
in her habeas corpus petition,ringgold declares on june,apanius faxed a copy of the document which was in her hand at the hearing.citation.the document is entitled addendum to agreement for moving and storage services.the customer name on the agreement is incorrect because nina ringgold as an individual does not have an agreement with public storage.the contract ringgold arranged with public storage is specifically in the name of the aubry family trust.the information concerning container numbers is all in the possession of trustee sankary and he is the only person who has keys.a copy of the document in question is attached to the petition.it is dated april.
the june,minute order states the court orders nina ringgold to sign the document that would allow counsel apanius to transfer possession of the personal property of decedents robert aubry and mary aubry located in a storage unit at public storage.nina ringgold indicates,in open court,her refusal to review and sign said document.the court finds nina ringgold in direct contempt of the court order.nina ringgold is sentenced to the county jail for five days.execution of sentence is stayed until june.court states that nina ringgold may cure this contempt by signing said order.the matter is continued to june,at in this department for execution of sentence.

ringgold filed the present verified petition for a writ of supersedeas,habeas corpus,or other appropriate relief on june.on the same date,we issued a temporary stay order of the jail sentence.we issued an order to show cause on june.
iii.discussion 
ringgold argues the trial court lacked jurisdiction to make the contempt finding because the december,order was the subject of a pending appeal.we disagree.to begin with,ringgold was not found in contempt of the december,order.ringgold was found in contempt of the june,oral order,issued in open court,to sign the document giving sankary,as trustee,access to the property in the storage facility.more critically,the december,order directing the delivery of personal property was not automatically stayed by the appeal therefrom.section provides,the perfecting of an appeal shall not stay enforcement of the judgment or order of the trial court if the judgment or order appealed from directs the assignment or delivery of personal property,including documents unless an undertaking is given the december,order indisputably directs the delivery of personal and keys.ringgold provided no,the december,order was not stayed.
ringgold relies on baar smith cal,for the proposition that section is inapplicable if the petitioner is not in possession of the personal property that is the subject of the order.baar was decided in under former section,from which section was in part derived.west civ.proc.historical note foll.former section then provided in part if the judgment or order appealed from direct the assignment or delivery of documents or personal property,the execution of the judgment or order can not be stayed by appeal,unless the things required to be assigned or delivered be placed in the custody of such officer or receiver as the court may appoint,or unless an undertaking be entered into on the part of the appellant,with at least two sureties,and in such amount as the court,or a judge thereof,may direct,to the effect that the appellant will obey the order of the appellate court upon the appeal.stats,ch,see bailey superior court.in baar,the petitioner was not in possession of the property she was ordered to deliver.baar smith,supra,cal.at,the findings specifically show that defendant is not in the present possession of said stock and was not at the time said judgment was rendered therefore,it would be impossible for her to comply with any order requiring her to deliver such stock to plaintiff hence,section of the code of civil procedure would be inapplicable.citations.see also,mccallion hibernia savings loan soc.cal,no stay bond required where money was in court possession boldemann chocolate price cal d,no undertaking required where insurance policy was in court clerk custody.there is no merit to ringgold automatic stay contention.
however,the written contempt order failed to comply with the strict requirements of section,subdivision a as articulated by the supreme court.a direct contempt may be punished summarily,but an order reciting the facts is required,subd.a witkin,cal.procedure ed.trial.section,subdivision a provides in pertinent part when a contempt is committed in the immediate view and presence of the court,or of the judge at chambers,it may be punished summarily for which an order must be made,reciting the facts as occurring in such immediate view and presence,adjudging that the person proceeded against is thereby guilty of a contempt,and that he or she be punished as therein prescribed.
a valid written contempt order consists of three elements.in the case of in re buckley cal d,the supreme court identified the three elements of a valid contempt order a recitation of the facts constituting the contempt the fact the person was adjudged to be in contempt and a statement of the punishment.see arthur superior court cal d.this case involves the first element of a contempt recitation of facts requirement.the recitation of facts requirement is jurisdictional.in re littlefield cal th,d,chula superior court cal d,in re wells cal d.
section was originally adopted in as part of the codification of california law.see people post th,d explaining codification of california law hogoboom superior court th,d same.the first sentence in section as adopted in,except for minor capitalization and gender reference changes,is repeated verbatim in current section,subdivision a the code commissioners note to former section states order punishing for contempt must state facts upon which the exercise of the power is founded.people turner,ex parte field,ex parte rowe.if the order fining and imprisoning for contempt,does not specify on its face wherein the contempt consisted,it will be reversed on parte field,see code comrs.note foll.code civ,ed,haymond burch.in people turner cal,the case referred to in the annotation to the original section,citing both english common law and american authority,the supreme court explained we think it follows from the distinctions above considered,that the final order of the court,by which a party is adjudged to have been guilty of a contempt,should always show,upon its face,the facts upon which the exercise of the power is based,and the adjudication made.this is certainly the general,if not the uniform practice.but the order in question does not set forth any facts,nor even show whether the proceeding was for an offence committed in the presence of the court,or at a distance from it.thus,from statehood,california courts have been required to recite in writing the facts that serve as the basis of the contempt order.
in the case of in re wells,supra,cal d at page,the supreme court described the,what is now,section,subdivision a recitation of facts requirement it is the general rule in this state that this requirement that the order recite the facts constituting the contempt is jurisdictional,and an order which assumes to punish summarily a direct contempt of court is void unless it shows on its face acts sufficient to constitute a legal contempt.the order must contain a statement of facts equivalent to those which the law says must be incorporated in an affidavit for constructive contempt and such facts must prove the contempt.mere conclusions are not sufficient.quoting in re battelle cal,direct contempt finding against witness for refusing to answer questions is invalid unless it contains an express recital of facts affirmatively showing not only the precise questions which he has declined to answer,but also affirmatively setting forth the facts which show the materiality and pertinency of the evidence to the issue before the court.the supreme court has noted a n order which assumes to punish summarily a direct contempt of court is void unless it shows on its face facts sufficient to constitute a legal contempt.citations.such facts must be stated with sufficient particularity to show,without aid of speculation,that contempt actually occurred.citation.chula superior court cal d,italics added.boysaw superior court cal th,d.in a similar vein,the supreme court has emphasized that the recitation of facts constituting the contempt must be done with specificity in the written order.see in re littlefield,supra,cal th at,d,fn.because we conclude the judgment of contempt must be set aside on the ground the document embodying the judgment fails to set forth with sufficient specificity the particular acts upon which the trial court based the exercise of its contempt power,we need not and therefore do not address the numerous other arguments made by petitioner.further,the recital of facts requirement is not satisfied by a judge conclusions as to the acts constituting the contempt nor may the order be sustained by reference to extrinsic documents albeit,a transcript which places the conduct in context may be attached to the order.in re littlefield,supra,cal th at fn,d,fine superior court th,d.the order need not contain empty formalisms such as the misconduct occurred in the presence of the court when the recitation of facts in the order show that is exactly what happened.boysaw superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
as will be noted,this case involves the failure of the june,minute order and the june,written contempt order to set forth with the requisite particularity the december,order to provide the documents necessary to transfer possession of the personal property located in the storage unit.it was ringgold refusal to sign the document that would allow that property to be transferred to its rightful owners that was the contemptuous conduct.but the only reason the refusal to sign the document was a violation of a lawful oral order was because ringgold had already been ordered in writing to turn over documents that would allow the trustee to take possession of the property in the storage unit.
in boysaw and littlefield,our supreme court explained what must be in the written contempt order when the contemptuous conduct arises from a prior court order.in littlefield,on june,the supreme court described the oral order ultimately violated by wilbur littlefield,the los angeles county public defender the court ordered the defense to contact the witness by telephone,obtain her address,and provide it to the prosecution,or,alternatively,to produce the witness in court in order to afford the prosecution an opportunity to interview her prior to trial.in re littlefield,supra,cal th at,d.littlefield refused to obey that oral order.yet when the written contempt order was prepared,the following mistake occurred the written judgment of contemp
