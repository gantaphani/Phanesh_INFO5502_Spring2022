discussion 
a.the evidence of plaintiff prior sexual history 
defendant first contends that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in excluding evidence that plaintiff had engaged in an extramarital affair with a neighbor around the time of the assault.prior to the second trial,defendant had moved to introduce evidence of plaintiff sexual history under federal rule of evidence,popularly known as the rape shield law.rule bars the admission of evidence offered to prove that the victim engaged in other sexual behavior or to prove the victim sexual predisposition.a,unless the probative value outweighs the danger of harm to the victim and of unfair prejudice to any party.b.
in particular,defendant sought to introduce evidence that plaintiff had engaged in the extramarital affair,that she had been involved in a sexual relationship with a teacher while in high school,that she had propositioned a construction worker,and that she had been repeatedly sexually abused as a child.plaintiff responded with a motion to exclude the evidence identified in defendant motion,as well as other evidence about plaintiff sexual history that had been revealed in discovery.in particular,plaintiff argued that because defendant rule motion had not been filed under seal,as required by federal rule of evidence c,all the evidence identified in that motion should be excluded.further,plaintiff argued that defendant had not shown that the evidence probative value substantially outweigh ed the danger of harm to any victim and of unfair prejudice to any party.b.the court sanctioned defendant for failing to file his motion under seal by denying his motion and granting plaintiff motion to exclude the evidence,based upon the violation of the rape shield law and public policy.
defendant subsequently made a brand new motion to introduce rule evidence.defendant wanted to introduce evidence of plaintiff extramarital affair to show that it was the affair,not the assault by defendant,that had destroyed plaintiff marriage.plaintiff herself then moved to introduce evidence of her childhood sexual abuse because her expert psychiatrist considered these two events of plaintiff abused childhood as the basis for his stress disorder diagnosis.the court granted plaintiff motion,and invited defendant to file a supplemental memorandum regarding any rule evidence that should now be admitted because plaintiff had opened the door.defendant responded,not with a legal argument,but with a list of incidents he wanted to introduce.a series of supplemental memoranda were exchanged.
the magistrate judge granted in part and denied in part defendant motion.the court excluded evidence of plaintiff sexual predisposition and voluntary sexual acts as per se barred by rule,as well as the previously excluded evidence of the extramarital affair,on the ground that there was no need to
