petitioner national labor relations board nlrb or board brought this petition for adjudication of civil contempt against respondent labor union local,international brotherhood of electrical workers,local,seeking to enforce a judgment of this court entered on june,judgment and a consent order entered on july,consent order.the court appointed john martin,as special master to conduct a hearing on the board contempt application.upon hearing all the evidence,special master martin special master or master issued findings of fact and conclusions of law on april,a supplemental ruling on the issue of attorneys fees on may,and recommendations with respect to remedies on july,as amended on august.both the board and local have filed objections to the special master findings of fact,conclusions of law,and recommended remedies.we presume the parties are familiar with the facts,the procedural history,and the scope of issues presented for review here,which we reference only as necessary to support our decision.as discussed below,we affirm the special master findings of fact and conclusions of law in their entirety.we adopt and affirm,with some modifications,the special master recommendations concerning remedies.
local is a labor union whose organizing activities have been by this court.see nlrb local,cir per curiam discussing local long history of unfair labor practices and its involvement in prior litigation before this court and in administrative proceedings before the board.the judgment and consent order implicated in this case specifically discussed local responsibilities to abide by section b of the national labor relations act,et.section b is commonly referred to as the act secondary boycott provision,which prohibits any labor organization from picketing against an employer with whom it does not have a dispute,with an object of forcing that secondary employer to cease doing business with a primary employer.nlrb local,cir.
in its petition for civil contempt,the board alleged that local had violated the judgment,the consent order,and section b by conducting illegal secondary boycotts on two occasions.in the first incident,the hertz rental car facility located at new york john kennedy airport needed electrical work.hertz hired mac k construction mac k as its general contractor for the project,and mac k in turn hired gunzer electric gunzer as an electrical subcontractor.local primary dispute was with gunzer by its own admission,local had no dispute with hertz or mac local picketed gunzer at the hertz site on various dates in april and may the board alleged that this picketing was not temporally limited to days when gunzer was actually working,nor was it geographically limited to gunzer specific gate at the work site and instead unlawfully impeded on neutral employees and customers entrances to hertz.according to the board,local attempted to interrupt hertz normal operations by conducting an illegal,delaying and otherwise disrupting the car rental business.on four days of picketing,a local picketer brought an approximately inflatable rat balloon to the picket line bearing a sign around its neck that read hurts is a rat.the board argued that this use of the inflatable rat balloon also constituted illegal secondary boycotting.
the board also alleged that local had violated the secondary boycott provisions during pickets conducted at new york city empire state building in august.the empire state brewing corporation,doing business as heartland brewery,sought to build a restaurant within the empire state building.again,local dispute in this construction project was limited to the electrical subcontractor,in this instance a company called r l systems.the board alleged that despite having notice of the hours during which r l systems employees would be working at the restaurant site,local refused to confine its picketing to those hours and delayed the completion of the project.finally,the board alleged that various local business representatives involved in these pickets failed to receive copies of the relevant court orders binding local,as required by the consent order.
ii.discussion 
a.the findings of civil contempt against local 
the board had the burden of proving local alleged contempt before the special master by clear and convincing evidence.see,nlrb stevens,cir per curiam nlrb stevens,cir.because the board sought a judgment of civil rather than criminal contempt,it did not have to show willfulness by local 
the special master found that the board had met its burden,and concluded that local had violated the judgment and consent order when it engaged in two unlawful secondary boycotts in violation of section b of the national labor relations act,et.the special master found a third instance of civil contempt for local failure to provide certain of its business representatives with copies of the judgment and consent order,as required by the terms of that consent order.those conclusions were based on detailed findings of fact,as well as the special master general finding that 
having had the opportunity to observe all of the witnesses,the special master finds that the witnesses presented by the nlrb were truthful and candid and that,to the extent that witnesses called by local contradicted the testimony of the nlrb witnesses,their contradictory testimony was not worthy of belief.
findings of fact and conclusions of law,april,at.
our review of the special master conclusions is a limited one,as we must accept his findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.nlrb stevens,at.while the special master conclusions of law merit no particular deference,his determinations of credibility are entitled to great weight.id.at.therefore,it is ordinarily from the testimony credited by the master that our assessment of whether clear and convincing evidence exists must be made.id.emphasis added.with this standard in mind,and upon review of the proceedings below,we can not find that the special master factual findings were clearly erroneous.we additionally find that he applied the correct legal standard to those facts,and therefore we uphold in their entirety the special master conclusions that local violated the prior orders of this court,and we adjudge local guilty of civil contempt in the three circumstances identified by the special master.
b.the special master recommended remedies 
having upheld the special master findings of civil contempt,we turn now to his recommended remedies.our powers here are more plenary,as the court is not bound by the narrow scope of review applicable to the master factual findings,but instead may accept,reject,or modify his recommendations in order to provide full remedial relief.id.at internal citation omitted quoting mccomb jacksonville paper.both the board and local have objected to various recommended remedies.we evaluate each provision in turn.
the prospective fines from the consent order 
the consent order called for prospective compliance fines against local of for each and every future violation of the judgment,with additional fines of per day in the case of a continuing violation.applying this rubric,the master recommended imposing a total compliance fine of against local for the four separate instances in which local failed to provide copies of the judgment and consent order to its business representatives,for the eleven days of illegal secondary boycotting at the hertz facility,and for the four days of illegal secondary boycotting at the heartland brewery facility.local objects to this fine on two grounds first,that the assessed for failure to provide documents to its business representatives exceeds the amount sought by the board and second,that imposition of these fines converts the proceeding from one of civil to that of criminal contempt because local was not provided the opportunity to purge its contempt according to the dictates of int l union,united mine workers bagwell,d.
local first objection is easily disposed of.although it is true that the board only sought a fine for the union failure to provide copies of the judgment and consent order,the special master was not charged merely to approve or disapprove the board preferred remedies,but rather to fashion the remedial relief he found appropriate the master directly addressed his divergence from the board view in his recommendations 
it appears to the special master that is the appropriate fine for this violation,because the failure to provide the required documentation to and obtain the mandated acknowledgments from four different business representatives on four distinct dates amounts to four separate violations.
recommendations of the special master with respect to remedies,july,at hereafter,recommendations.again,we can not conclude that the master factual findings with regard to these violations were clearly erroneous,and therefore we uphold the application of in compliance fines for those four discrete violations of the judgment and consent order.
nor do we find that the imposition of such fines violates the precepts of the bagwell decision.in bagwell,a virginia state court judge enjoined the united mine workers from committing various labor law violations.that judge subsequently found the labor organization in civil contempt and assessed approximately million in noncompensatory fines for violations of the injunction.upon review,the united states supreme court expressed its concern with the dangers of contempt proceedings that leave the offended judge solely responsible for identifying,prosecuting,adjudicating,and sanctioning the contumacious conduct.bagwell,at.it found that the bagwell prosecution should have been considered a proceeding in criminal contempt,as the fines assessed were criminal and punitive rather than civil and coercive.before such fines could be imposed,the affected labor organization merited the right to jury trial and the opportunity to purge its contempt as a protection against the arbitrary exercise of official power.id.at.quoting bloom illinois,d.
we find,as did the special master,that the instant situation is distinct from bagwell and more closely analogous to the ninth circuit decision in nlrb ironworkers local,cir.in the latter decision,the ninth circuit also was tasked with evaluating a consent order between the nlrb and a labor organization.the panel noted that bagwell was an unusual situation not involving the nlrb,and that no court has ever held that nlrb enforcement proceedings are criminal in nature,for the national labor relations act is generally regarded to be a civil regulatory and remedial statute.id.at.compliance fines under the consent order could be considered civil in nature,as their imposition would serve the purpose of coercing future compliance with the consent decree.id.at.finally,the ironworkers decision held that the labor organization had no right to purge its contempt under the terms of the consent order t he union can be adjudged in contempt even if it is no longer violating the order,because it had the opportunity to avoid the fine by not engaging in the prohibited conduct in the first place.id.at.
for the same reasons enumerated by the ninth circuit in ironworkers,we find that the imposition of compliance fines against local according to a schedule to which they explicitly agreed in the consent order is not precluded by the bagwell decision.local objection is overruled,and we uphold that portion of the special master recommended remedies assessing in compliance fines against local.
the recommended increase in prospective fines 
in addition to fining local under the terms of the consent order,the master also recommended increasing the fine schedule for future violations of the order,as the existing fines ha ve proven to be inadequate and a significant increase is appropriate to coerce future compliance.recommendations at.the special master recommended increasing the prospective compliance fines to per violation and an additional per day for each day that a violation continued.id the special master also recommended the imposition of prospective individual fines of per violation and for each additional day against any local officer,employee,agent,representative,or any other person including picketers acting in concert or participation with local in violating the consent order.local objects that any increase in the prospective fines also violates the precepts of the bagwell decision,and that the imposition of fines against individuals is unwarranted.
we do not agree that increasing the prospective fines against local violates bagwell,for the same reasons discussed previously.we also note that the court retains the ability to modify a consent order to insure the order intended objectives the presence of a consent order vests the court with equitable discretion to enforce the obligations imposed on the parties the court interest in protecting the integrity of such a decree justifies any reasonable action taken by the court to secure compliance.united states local,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted see also eeoc local,int l ass of bridge,structural,and ornamental ironworkers,cir holding that courts possess inherent power to enforce consent judgments,beyond the remedial contractual terms agreed upon by the parties.given the special master conclusion that severe sanctions are necessary to ensure local compliance with the orders of this court,and the uncontested finding that local possesses more than million in assets,the proposed increase in the prospective fines seems necessary and not unduly onerous.local objection is overruled in part,as we uphold the recommended increase in prospective fines against local itself.
we decline,however,to impose new prospective fines on local individual officers,agents,representatives,or members for violations of the consent order.any contumacious activity by such persons also may be imputed to local relief for such conduct may be sought by bringing a contempt action against the union,thereby allowing the board to fulfill its objectives without running the risk of chilling legitimate organizing activity by individual members of the organization.we therefore sustain local objection in part,and the special master recommendations are denied as to this provision.
the award of attorneys fees to the board 
the special master found both that the board was entitled to receive costs and attorneys fees as a prevailing party,and that these fees should be calculated by reference to the prevailing private practice market rate.recommendations at.local objects to the private market rate metric for reimbursement,arguing that the board should only receive reimbursement for the attorneys fees it actually incurred,the board should be reimbursed at government salary rates,which are lower than those paid to attorneys in private practice.local also argues in its brief though not in its formal objections that the board attorneys travel time should be reimbursed at of the private market rate.
as the board urges,in blum stenson,d,the supreme court held that attorneys fees awarded to a nonprofit legal aid organization under are to be calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community,regardless of whether plaintiff is represented by private or nonprofit counsel.id.at.courts have applied blum to calculate government attorneys fees in a variety of contexts beyond civil rights litigation.see,united states city of jackson,cir awarding government attorneys fees based on prevailing rate in contempt proceeding concerning fair housing standards napier thirty or more unidentified federal agents,employees,or officers,cir applying blum where government sought attorneys fees in context of rule sanctions nlrb graveley.roofing,cir applying napier to award nlrb prevailing market rates see also united states big enterprises,cir awarding prevailing rate to government attorneys in context of rule sanctions.consistent with this precedent,district courts in this circuit generally employ market rates to calculate awards of government attorneys fees.nlrb sports,united states kirksey.
we also note that because government attorneys receive a fixed salary and do not bill a client for their services,a proportionate share of attorneys salaries does not necessarily correlate to expenses actually incurred in pursuing a given case.
