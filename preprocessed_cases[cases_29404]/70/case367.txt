basf corporation is headquartered in mount olive,new jersey,and is comprised of operating units,one of which is devoted to the company styrenics production npr unit the products for basf npr unit are manufactured at plants throughout north america,including one in joliet,illinois,which manufactures various forms of polystyrene.as a result of financial losses suffered by the company npr unit,basf implemented a program of site process optimization in,which was completed in early.despite this program,the npr unit performance for was still slightly negative and only a modest return on assets was projected for.this resulted in basf developing a new business plan that included the reorganization of virtually the entire npr unit,the purpose of which was to reduce the number of personnel and repopulat e the organization with individuals who demonstrated specific behavioral skills and attributes that basf believed were necessary to the unit future success,and who,going forward,could do more with less in order to achieve the necessary return on assets.in february,basf formally notified the joliet facility employees of its intention to restructure the npr unit.
in the first phase of the restructuring process,basf offered a voluntary special early retirement program vserp to all employees aged or over who had ten or more years of service with the company as of december.during the second phase,all employees who desired to continue their employment with the npr unit,young and old alike,were assessed to determine whether they possessed the competencies the company believed were necessary to effectively restructure the unit.employees who lacked these competencies would be deselected,terminated.to assist it with the assessment process,basf retained the services of development dimensions international ddi,a leader in the behavioral assessment field.
basf began the restructuring process by categorizing all of the employees from its npr unit into job families.nine of the plaintiffs were placed in the operators job family,hourly plant or lab workers,and one plaintiff,pearl adams,was placed in the individual contributor job family,which was designated for salaried,employees.key competencies for each job family were then defined.some of the competencies were developed through the joint efforts of basf and ddi,whereas others were designed solely by basf.
shortly thereafter,ddi assessed personnel at the various npr facilities nationwide.at the joliet plant,operators and individual contributors were evaluated with identical standard assessment,exercises,and targeted interviewing.these assessments were done over the telephone and ddi employees were not informed of the age,race or national origin of the basf employees being evaluated.ddi forwarded its results to basf for further consideration by the company selection panels the selection panels were committees formed by basf and were comprised of individuals selected for leadership roles in the new organization to act as the final arbiters on the competency levels of those individuals currently employed by the company in its npr unit.the selection panel assembled to assess the competencies of employees in the operators job family at the joliet facility included kevin biehle a defendant in this action,lawrence brandin,rich harris,gerard sabo also a defendant,troy shaner,and thad zdunich.the selection panel for the individual contributors job family at the joliet facility consisted of biehle,brandin,sabo,shaner,and rick lee.katherine reardon,a defendant and basf director of human resources for the polymers division which includes the company npr unit,attended all of the panel meetings held at the joliet facility to oversee the implementation of the selection process and to ensure that the relevant guidelines were consistently applied.
the purpose of each selection panel was twofold to review ddi scores and integrate them with the panels collective knowledge of each employee workplace behavior and performance and to evaluate additional competencies of each employee not considered by ddi.in reviewing ddi competency evaluations,the selection panels applied the same scale utilized by ddi to evaluate whether the scores given to an employee were consistent with his or her actual exhibited workplace behavior and performance.if no panel member voiced disagreement with a score assigned to an employee by ddi,it became final for that particular competency.panel members who disagreed with a competency score were required to identify specific instances of workplace conduct that called into question the accuracy of the score given by ddi to the employee.this was then followed by a panel discussion on the behavioral examples cited by the objecting panel member s.if the panel reached a consensus that the ddi score did not accurately reflect an employee behavior or performance,the score was increased or decreased accordingly the initial findings of the selection panels were then reviewed by basf legal department and analyzed by roland deloach,basf manager of equal employment opportunity,for possible adverse impact.basf was advised that the tentative results of the assessment process employed by the company did not have a statistically significant impact on any protected group.upon being so advised,basf finalized the decisions made by the selection panels,which were then conveyed to npr unit employees on june.
thereafter,pearl adams,daniel allen,rodney bryant,terry cerutti,richard clinton,steven davis,anita krantz,james perona,steve real,and michael of whom were terminated for having six or more developmental suit against basf,kevin biehle,kathy reardon,and gerard sabo.all ten of the plaintiffs alleged that basf fired and declined to rehire them because of their age in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea,et.plaintiff steve real who is hispanic and plaintiffs pearl adams,daniel allen,and michael severado all of whom are black,also filed claims against basf,alleging that the company fired and declined to rehire them on account of their race or national origin in violation of title vii,et,and against biehle,reardon,and sabo,alleging that they intentionally interfered with these plaintiffs employment relationships because of their race or national origin in violation of.the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted.the defendants also filed a motion for sanctions against the plaintiffs counsel,which the court denied.the plaintiffs appeal the district court decision granting the defendants motion for summary judgment,and the defendants the court denial of their motion for sanctions.
the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in granting the defendants summary judgment for their age,race,and national origin discrimination claims.we review de novo the district court decision to grant summary judgment,construing all facts,and drawing all reasonable inferences from those facts,in favor of the plaintiffs,the parties in this case.peele country mut.ins,cir.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.

if a plaintiff can not prevail under the direct method of proof,he must proceed under the indirect method,the familiar mcdonnell douglas framework.adams,at.in the context of a workplace restructuring or reorganization,where the employer is cleaning house and essentially no one job is safe,a plaintiff proceeding under the indirect method must,as an initial matter,show that he is a member of a protected class,race,national origin,age he was qualified to be retained or rehired he was discharged,not rehired,not promoted,or the like,as a result of the workplace restructuring or reorganization and similarly situated employees outside of his protected class were treated more favorably by the employer hartley wisconsin bell,cir see also paluck gooding rubber,cir.if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of age,race,or national origin discrimination,the employer,to avoid liability,must then produce a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision.peele,at.if the employer offers a legitimate,nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision,the plaintiff must then rebut that explanation by presenting evidence sufficient to enable a trier of fact to find that the employer proffered explanation is pretextual,a lie.id.a plaintiff does not reach the pretext stage,however,unless he first establishes a prima facie case of discrimination under the indirect method.id.

adea claims 
all ten plaintiffs allege that they were terminated and not rehired by basf because of age discrimination.specifically,the plaintiffs argue that they offered evidence sufficient to establish age discrimination under either the direct or indirect method of proof.in support of their direct method argument,the plaintiffs contend that the early retirement offer made by basf to certain older employees in the first phase of the restructuring process was discriminatory and not truly voluntary either jay kline,the head of the npr unit,or kathy reardon,the director of human resources for the npr unit,stated at a restructuring meeting with employees there no other way it going to be out with the old and in with the new and several ageist statements were made by thad zdunich and troy shaner to plaintiff daniel allen,allen is going to handle the young pups and how is the old man doing today.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the preceding evidence,even when viewed in its most favorable light,is insufficient to allow the plaintiffs to maintain claims against the defendants for age discrimination under the direct method.
to begin with,the plaintiffs argument that basf engaged in age discrimination simply by offering some of its older workers early retirement packages is a nonstarter.robinson ppg industries,cir holding that t ruly voluntary retirements do not give rise to an inference of age discrimination.rather,an offer of incentives to retire early is a benefit to the recipient,not a sign of discrimination.henn national geographic,cir.nor is it reasonable to infer that the retirement program offered by basf in the first phase of the restructuring process was discriminatory or involuntary merely because some of the employees who accepted the company offer did so out of a fear that they would not make the grade after being assessed.id.at.the adea was not enacted to immunize older employees,those and over from being terminated for legitimate reasons,poor social skills,bad attitude,incompetency,but was instead designed to protect them from being discriminated against on the basis of their age.mullin raytheon,cir noting that t he adea was not intended to protect older workers from the often harsh economic realities of common business decisions and the hardships associated with corporate reorganizations,downsizing,plant closings and relocations citation omitted allen diebold,cir same.
the plaintiffs reliance on the out with the old,in with the new statement allegedly made by either kline or reardon is also misplaced.first,neither kline nor reardon was involved in the decisionmaking process that resulted in the plaintiffs terminations and served as the basis for their not being rehired.kline was not a member of either selection panel and reardon merely sat in on the selection panel meetings as a moderator of sorts.thus,any statement made by either of these individuals that amount s to mere speculation as to the thoughts of the decisionmaker is irrelevant to an inquiry of discrimination.arbitration forums,cir citation omitted see also chiaramonte fashion bed group,cir same.second,even if kline and reardon could be characterized as decisionmakers for purposes of the plaintiffs adea claims,there is nothing inherently discriminatory about the colloquialism out with the old,in with the new,and the plaintiffs offer no evidence upon which a reasonable jury could infer that this phrase was used by kline or reardon in a discriminatory manner.rogers,at.
finally,the stray workplace remarks that the plaintiffs attribute to shaner and zdunich offer no support to their claims of age discrimination.although shaner and zdunich both participated in the decisionmaking process that led to the plaintiffs terminations they did so as members of selection actual decisionmakers in this case.shager upjohn,cir noting that a committee can act as a decisionmaker in the employment discrimination context.thus,the plaintiffs evidence of shaner or zdunich alleged animus toward older workers is relevant only if there is other evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that their animus influenced the selection panels deliberations to such a degree so as to result in the plaintiffs terminations.shager,at.in sum,the plaintiffs were required to show a causal link between the prejudicial views allegedly expressed by shaner and zdunich and the plaintiffs,that the committee decision to fire them was tainted by this prejudice.id.the plaintiffs have presented no such evidence,however,and therefore they can not rely on any statements made by shaner and zdunich to support their age discrimination claims.but even if the plaintiffs could make use of the stray remarks they attribute to shaner and zdunich,how the old man doing today,it would do them little good because these statements are clearly not sufficient to establish cases of age discrimination under the direct method of proof adams,at cir noting that circumstantial evidence under the direct method must point directly to a discriminatory reason for the employer action emphasis added cianci,at noting that before seemingly stray workplace remarks will qualify as evidence of discrimination under the direct method of proof,the plaintiff must show that the remarks were related to the employment decision in question citation omitted.
the plaintiffs also argue,however,that they presented evidence sufficient to establish prima facie cases of age discrimination under the indirect method.as with most cases proceeding under the mcdonnell douglas framework,only the second and fourth requirements of the test are at issue,the legitimate expectations and similarly situated prongs.the plaintiffs contend that they were qualified to be retained or rehired by basf and that similarly situated younger employees were treated more favorably by the company in the workplace restructuring or reorganization process.we disagree.it is undisputed that basf established six or more developmental needs as the standard for being unqualified to remain with the company,and that each of the plaintiffs was terminated after the selection panels concluded that they possessed six or more developmental needs.the plaintiffs do not contest either of these facts,but instead maintain that they were qualified to be retained by basf because the methodology used by the company to measure the competency of its employees was inherently flawed their prior positive performance reviews demonstrate that they were qualified to be retained many of them were found to be competent in areas by ddi,but had their scores lowered by the selection panels and there is no appreciable difference between the job duties of employees in the restructured organization and those performed by employees under the former regime.almost all of these arguments,however,are merely an attempt by the plaintiffs to characterize the assessment process utilized by basf in restructuring its npr unit as a pretext for age discrimination.but a plaintiff is not entitled to call into question the veracity or motives of his employer unless he first demonstrates that he was meeting the employer legitimate workplace expectations.peele,at noting that i f a plaintiff fails to demonstrate that she was meeting her employer legitimate expectations,the employer may not be put to the burden of stating the reasons for her termination citation omitted coco elmwood care,cir same.a plaintiff does not reach the pretext stage of mcdonnell douglas,however,unless she first establishes a prima facie case of discrimination.peele,at.to the extent the plaintiffs contentions could possibly be interpreted as arguments that they were qualified to be retained or rehired by basf,or that the company applied its legitimate employment expectations in a discriminatory manner we will address them.
at the outset,we note that one of the primary purposes of the restructuring process implemented by basf was to determine whether its current employees possessed the skills necessary to perform prospectively in a manner consistent with the company newly devised,increased workplace expectations.that basf chose to make such determinations by utilizing a process that did not take into account the plaintiffs prior written performance evaluations is of no import.scott parkview memorial,cir emphasizing that employers are not required to prefer evaluations over contextual assessments by knowledgeable reviewers,or to exalt an assessment of past conduct over a prediction of future performance emphasis added.indeed,whether the plaintiffs or this court believe that basf prescribed methodology for gauging the prospective abilities of its employees was fair,prudent,or wise is beside the point.employers,not employees or courts,are entitled to define the core qualifications for a position,so long as the criteria utilized by the company are of a nondiscriminatory nature.leisen city of shelbyville,cir.and there is certainly nothing inherently discriminatory about an employer decision to use criteria other than past performance evaluations to determine whether its employees can meet the increased workplace expectations that often coincide with a corporate reorganization.gorence eagle food centers,cir noting that w hat the qualifications for a position are,even if those qualifications change,is a business decision,one courts should not interfere with.indeed,we have repeatedly held that prior job performance evaluations,standing alone,do not create a genuine issue of triable fact when there have been substantial alterations in the employee responsibilities in the intervening period.peele,at citation omitted emphasis in original see also fortier ameritech mobile communications,cir grohs gold bond.products,cir.nor is there anything discriminatory about basf decision to allow selection panels comprised of management and supervisors to make the final decision as to whether its employees were competent in a given category rather than leaving that to consultant ddi 
the plaintiffs also imply that basf applied its legitimate workplace expectations in a disparate manner because the company fired the plaintiffs yet retained two individuals with six or more developmental partilla and helynne smith.what plaintiffs counsel neglects to mention,however,is that both partilla and smith are not outside the protected class.furthermore,it does not appear that partilla or smith are substantially younger than any of the plaintiffs as plaintiffs make no such argument.it is also worth noting that basf terminated every employee under the age of with six or more developmental needs.
moreover,because basf did not rely on prior performance evaluations in the restructuring process to ascertain whether its current employees were qualified to be retained,the plaintiffs may not use those evaluations as a basis for arguing that the company applied its legitimate workplace expectations in a discriminatory manner by comparing their evaluations with those of younger employees who were retained.finally,the plaintiffs were not qualified to be rehired by the company for the same reason that they were not lacked the necessary competencies 
for all of the preceding reasons,we conclude that the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they were qualified to be retained or rehired by basf,and thus they can not make out prima facie cases of age discrimination under the indirect method.peele,at coco,at.we,therefore,need not address the plaintiffs remaining arguments as to whether substantially younger employees were treated more favorably by basf,or engage in any type of pretext inquiry.coco,at 
race and national origin claims 
plaintiffs pearl adams,daniel allen,michael severado all of whom are black,and steve real who is hispanic also contend that the district court erred in granting the defendants summary judgment for their race and national origin discrimination claims under title vii and.in support of these claims,these plaintiffs assert that they worked in an environment replete with racist comments and where minority workers were treated as citizens.several of the racist comments referenced by the plaintiffs,however,are either extremely dated or were made by individuals who had no involvement or influence over the decisionmaking process that led to their terminations.therefore,these comments can not be used by the plaintiffs to support claims of race or national origin discrimination under the direct method swanson leggett platt,cir noting that o nly evidence on the attitudes of the employees involved in the decision to fire the plaintiffs is relevant.the only racist acts attributed to anyone involved in the decisionmaking process concern thad zdunich a member of the operators selection panel and kevin biehle a member of both selection panels.according to the plaintiffs,zdunich made hundreds of racial statements to plaintiff daniel allen between and,such as it got to be a black thing for brothers only brothers meeting today and what you mean,brothers meeting as for biehle,the plaintiffs claim that he treated steve real with less cordiality than he treated caucasian workers,told pearl adams the reason you here is because you do fit into our new family and you have b
