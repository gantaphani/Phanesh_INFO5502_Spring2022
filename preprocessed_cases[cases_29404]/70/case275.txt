this is an appeal from the district court decision finding boyd greene in contempt for violating its order enjoining him from using the intellectual property of his former employer,gnesys.it found that greene had illegally used confidential and proprietary information regarding gnesys products in marketing his own product overseas.the central issue on appeal is whether greene timely appealed the district court orders finding him in contempt and directing him to pay compensatory damages.we conclude that he did not,and accordingly we dismiss the appeal of the district court ruling on these two substantive issues.however,we affirm the district court finding that greene willfully violated the injunction and its consequent award of attorney fees to gnesys.
background and procedural history.
gnesys manufactures and sells the hydrasep oil water separator,a device that separates oil from water.until he left the company because of a salary dispute,greene had served gnesys in several positions over the years shareholder of gnesys from to august,employee and officer until his resignation on may,and a member of the board of directors until he resigned that position on april.
on august,gnesys sued greene in federal court.gnesys alleged that greene unauthorized use of gnesys intellectual property constituted unfair competition and violated state tort law.according to gnesys,after greene left the company,it discovered that greene sought to obtain patent rights in india for greene own stakpak product,and distributed to potential investors in the united states and china stakpak business plans which contained information he knew to be the confidential and proprietary information of gnesys.he also allegedly used photographs of the hydrasep device in promotional materials for the stakpak albeit with the gnesys logo digitally removed,and used product specifications for the stakpak that were almost verbatim the same as gnesys specifications for the hydrasep device.
on october,pursuant to a settlement agreement,the district court entered a consent preliminary injunction,which ordered greene to stop using gnesys intellectual property and infringing its patents related to its hydrasep device.on august,the court entered a consent permanent injunction and final judgment injunction to the same effect.
in april,gnesys moved the court to cite greene for contempt.the motion alleged six separate violations of the injunction,primarily related to greene continued unauthorized use of gnesys confidential and proprietary information to market his stakpak device.gnesys also sought compensatory damages,expenses,and attorney fees.
the district court found that greene willfully violated four provisions of the injunction and consequently was in contempt.the court accordingly directed gnesys to submit evidence that would support an award of damages,either compensatory or punitive.see contempt order,at.after receiving briefing from the parties,the court awarded gnesys in damages,and ordered greene to post a bond pending rescission of the patent application in india.see damages order,at.after additional briefing,the court also directed greene to reimburse gnesys for attorney fees and in costs that he had caused gnesys to incur.see attorney fees order july,at.on august,greene appealed all three orders.
ii.timeliness of appeal.
before reaching the merits of the district court decision,we consider whether greene timely appealed the orders finding him in contempt and awarding gnesys compensatory damages.
a party must file a notice of appeal with the district court within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.fed.a a.the judgment must be a final decision of the lower court.a final decision generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.budinich becton dickinson,d citation omitted.
in this case,the district court issued its contempt order on november,its damages order on august,and its attorney fees order on july.greene filed a notice of appeal on august,within days of the filing of the attorney fees order,but almost a year after the entry of the damages order.gnesys contends that the damages order was a final decision on the discrete issues of contempt and compensatory damages.therefore,it urges that the august,notice of appeal was not timely,because it was filed more than days after issuance of the lower court final decision of august.
greene responds that the attorney fees award was part of the merits decision and was intertwined with the damages assessment.as a result,he contends,the august damages order was not a final judgment,because an essential element of the damages award remained unresolved,so that the contempt judgment is appealable.
in budinich,the supreme court held that the district court decision denying petitioner new trial motion was final and appealable even when the court had not yet awarded attorney fees.there petitioner sued pursuant to a colorado statute to collect employment compensation that respondent owed him.a jury awarded petitioner only,and petitioner timely moved for a new trial and attorney fees.on may,the budinich court denied the new trial motions,found that petitioner was entitled to attorney fees,and ordered further briefing on the proper amount.on august,the trial court issued its final order concerning attorney fees.on august,petitioner filed its notice of appeal,which purported to cover all of the orders.see at.respondent moved to dismiss the appeal as untimely,arguing that the may ruling was a final judgment.the tenth circuit agreed and granted the motion to dismiss as to all issues except the attorney fees,which it affirmed on the merits.
the question thus presented to the supreme court on appeal was whether a decision on the merits is a final decision when the recoverability or amount of attorney fees for the litigation remains to be determined.id.at.the court unanimously held that the district court may order was a final decision.it reasoned that a question remaining to be decided after an order ending litigation on the merits does not prevent finality if its resolution will not alter the order or moot or revise decisions embodied in the order.id.citations omitted.as the court previously held in another case involving a claim,a request for attorney fees is not a motion to alter or amend the judgment under.e because it does not seek reconsideration of matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits a request for attorney fees under raises legal issues collateral to and separate from the decision on the merits.id.at.quoting white dep t of empl,d.
finally,the court held that a s a general matter we think it indisputable that a claim for attorney fees is not part of the merits of the action to which the fees pertain.such an award does not remedy the injury giving rise to the action,and indeed is often available to the party defending against the action.id.
the colorado statute at issue in budinich provided that,in a suit to collect compensation due from employment,the judgment shall include a reasonable attorney fee in favor of the winning party,to be taxed as part of the costs of the action.the budinich petitioner argued that there must be an exception to the general rule when the statute itself appears to make attorney fees part of the merits question.the court rejected this argument.it held that a determination as to whether a decision is final should not turn upon the characterization of those fees by the statute or decisional law that authorizes them.budinich,at.
in reaching this conclusion,the court cited to the need for the judicial system to function smoothly and the need for a uniform rule,even when an attorney fee provision appears to be more of a merits issue.as the court stated,
what is of importance here is not preservation of conceptual consistency in the statute of a particular fee authorization as merits or nonmerits,but rather preservation of operational consistency and predictability in the overall application of.this requires,we think,a uniform rule that an unresolved issue of attorney fees for the litigation in question does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final.
id.at.emphasis added see also morgan union metal,cir we ally ourselves with those circuits which have held that a judgment is final for purposes of appeal although the amount of attorney fees have not been determined.citation omitted.lastly,the court also held that t he time of appealability,having jurisdictional consequences,should above all be clear courts and litigants are best served by the rule.budinich,at.
on appeal,greene offers two arguments in an attempt to distinguish budinich.first,pointing to the fact that the injunction was a product of a settlement agreement as distinguished from an adjudication,he argues that gnesys is not entitled to attorney fees because the court finding of contempt was not a merits decision that disposed of the complaint.this argument is unpersuasive.there is no meaningful distinction for these purposes between a complaint that is resolved on the merits,and a complaint that leads to a consent injunction which is subsequently violated.to find otherwise would mean that a decision finding a party in contempt of an injunction as part of a settlement would not be appealable at all.greene argument is also contrary to prevailing caselaw,which routinely allows direct appeal from a contempt citation.see,peabody coal local union,and,cir rejecting appellee argument that lower court order holding appellant in contempt for violating injunction was not a final judgment see rolex watch,crowley,cir defendant appealed lower court finding of contempt for violating a consent permanent injunction.
second,greene argues that the award of attorney fees was part of the damages assessment,so that the initial decision fixing the compensatory damages was not a final decision.the clear message of budinich is to the contrary even when a statute provides that attorney fees are part of the damages claim,an award of compensatory damages effectively renders the decision final.
budinich compels the conclusion that greene appeal was not timely with respect to the district court finding of contempt and its award of compensatory damages.indeed,an untimely appeal deprives a court of jurisdiction to consider the matter c ompliance with the notice of appeal rule is a jurisdictional prerequisite which this court can neither waive nor extend.united states christunas,cir citations omitted 
as budinich held,and we reaffirm today,a decision awarding attorney fees is not part of the merits for purposes of determining if the lower court issued a final decision.this is so even if the attorney fees are authorized by statute,and even if the attorney fees are construed to be part of the damages or sanction awarded by the court.the primary interest in these matters is to draw a clear line.the alternative would be unnecessary confusion for parties and the courts alike,with the outcome turning on whether attorney fees in a particular case were deemed part of the merits.we accordingly dismiss the appeal from the lower court decision finding greene in contempt and awarding gnesys in damages.
iii.attorney fees.
we review a district court award of attorneys fees and expenses under a for abuse of discretion.see eagles,am.eagle found,cir the district court denial of attorney fees under a is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citation omitted see also johnson jones,cir this court has held that,pursuant to of the lanham act,attorney fees may be awarded in exceptional cases.thus,we review a district court decision to award attorney fees under the lanham act in the same way as its decision to award attorney fees under any discretionary provision,for an abuse of discretion.citations omitted.an abuse of discretion occurs when the district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applies the law,or employs an erroneous legal standard.barner pilkington,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.this circuit has defined an abuse of discretion as a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.eagles,at internal quotations omitted.
before reaching the merits,greene faces a procedural obstacle.he did not object in the district court to the appropriateness of the attorney fees award he only objected to the amount of fees and the market rate for attorney fees in memphis,tennessee.on appeal,however,he argues for the first time that no fees were justified.
the sixth circuit generally will not hear issues raised for the first time on appeal.we will deviate from this rule only in exceptional circumstances,such as when following the rule would cause a miscarriage of justice,and particularly where the question is entirely legal and has been fully briefed by both parties.golden,cir citation omitted.
as explained below,an award of attorney fees in this case would not be a miscarriage of justice.nor is the award of attorney fees here a purely legal issue of whether greene violation was willful is a question.in short,greene waived his right to argue on appeal the appropriateness of any attorney fees.
even if greene had not waived his right to appeal this issue,however,we conclude the district court decision to award attorney fees was not an abuse of discretion.
award of attorney fees 
on appeal,greene contends that the attorney fees award statute relied on by the district court,a,applies only to trademarks and is inapplicable here.this argument is incorrect.section a provides that,in exceptional circumstances,a court may award attorney fees for a violation of,inter alia,a also known as the lanham act.that provision,in turn,concerns false representation by those engaged in commerce.by the statute clear language it is not limited to trademark issues.as the supreme court held in dastar twentieth century fox film,d 
while much of the lanham act addresses the registration,use,and infringement of trademarks and related marks,a is one of the few provisions that goes beyond trademark protection.as originally enacted,a created a federal remedy against a person who used in commerce either a false designation of origin,or any false description or representation in connection with any goods or services.
id.at.quoting stat.
the district court demonstrated how greene violated the injunction in four respects,and how he did so deliberately.we agree.rather than detailing once again the minutiae,we attach as an appendix the district court contempt order.
most important for these purposes,the district court found that greene violated paragraph e i of the injunction,which prohibited greene from using or causing to be used any of gnesys names and marks on signs,decals,or other manner of display or in any promotional materials or from otherwise suggesting in any way that defendants products or services have been approved,endorsed,authorized or sponsored by or are in any way associated or connected with gnesys.see contempt order at emphasis added.the district court found that greene violated this provision by using a picture of gnesys hydrasep device in marketing his stakpak product with the gnesys logo digitally removed and by including a virtually verbatim description of the hydrasep device in greene description of his own product.see id.at.these district court findings fully support its conclusion that greene used a false description or representation in marketing his product.dastar,at.citation omitted.
the foregoing considered,we are persuaded that greene willfully disregarded the injunction,and that the district court decision to award attorney fees was not an abuse of discretion.
iv.conclusion.
the appeal of the district court decision finding greene in contempt and awarding compensatory damages is dismissed.the district court july,order awarding gnesys attorney fees and costs is affirmed.
