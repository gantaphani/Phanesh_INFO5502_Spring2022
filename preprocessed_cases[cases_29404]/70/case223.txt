in this appeal,we are called on to determine whether the bankruptcy court and district court,in affirming the bankruptcy court impermissibly vacated a state court judgment,enjoined further state court litigation,and held appellant robert aguiluz in contempt,pursuant to united states code,title,a.concluding that the state court judgment was not a determination of the personal liability of the debtor with respect to any debt discharged,we reverse,vacating the orders of the bankruptcy court and district court and remanding to the bankruptcy court with instructions.
facts and proceedings 
aguiluz and lisa bayhi were married in louisiana under a community property regime in march.no separate property agreements or orders were entered into or made prior to or during the existence of the marriage.
while they were still married to each other,the parties obtained several student loans through the student loan marketing association sallie mae,which were guaranteed by the united states.the couple consolidated several of these loans into a single loan the loan in.
both parties now acknowledge that the loan created a community obligation under article of the louisiana civil code.in addition,both parties acknowledge that they were and remain solidarily liable for the entirety of the loan 
the nature of their solidary liability is that of equal principals,not principal and distinction that shall be shown to have significance as the obligee of solidary,sallie mae could demand full performance on the loan obligation from either party or from both simultaneously.irrespective of whether sallie mae has or should ever demand such performance from either aguiluz or bayhi alone,and irrespective of whether either has or has not paid anything toward the other virile portion on the loan either party may have compelled and at any time still may compel contribution not payment to themselves but directly to sallie his or her virile portion as there are here but two solidary,the virile portion of each is of the loan obligation 
in august,the parties separated.their marriage was subsequently terminated pursuant to an april judgment of divorce.
in november,the parties entered into a community property settlement agreement the agreement,which was filed in the public records for the parish of east baton rouge,louisiana.the stated purpose of the agreement was to settle and liquidate all remaining community debts and to separate certain community property items as to each community obligation other than the loan,the parties assigned sole responsibility to one or the other.
as to the loan,however,paragraph iv of the agreement stated that the parties agree to split the sallie mae consolidated loan,each to pay one half the monthly payment until the debt is paid.at any time,either party may relieve his sic or herself of this obligation by paying one half the outstanding principal at the time such payment is made.no effort was made to revise or modify the loan hence no novation or to partition it into two separate debts sallie mae could still demand full performance from either party.thus,each party right to contribution inter se remained the same as before they executed the was entitled to enforce contribution from the other for of the loan,in arrears,or both 
in september,bayhi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter.she listed both aguiluz and sallie mae as creditors,but each with claim amount of.a short two months later,the bankruptcy court granted bayhi a general discharge under united states code,title.
aguiluz did not object to bayhi discharge,did not file a proof of claim,and did not seek to except any debt from discharge and neither did sallie mae consequently,any debts that bayhi owed to aguiluz were discharged.both parties agree,however,and the law acknowledges,that the discharge did not release bayhi from her solidary loan debt to sallie mae,as this debt was expressly exempted from discharge by one of the exceptions of the bankruptcy code,specifically,a.as shall be seen in our discussion of in re fields below,debts like state taxes and student loans,which are per se,need not be claimed in bankruptcy proceedings to remain completely immune from discharge.
even though,following her divorce and continuing after the execution of the agreement,bayhi had contributed her half of the periodic payments to sallie mae,she ceased making payments to sallie mae altogether when she filed her bankruptcy petition in.this continued for the two months between that filing and the entry of the discharge order,and has continued for almost a decade since that time.
in february,aguiluz wrote to bayhi requesting an explanation for bayhi failure to make her half of the periodic loan payments.after receiving no response,aguiluz filed a petition for declaratory judgment in state in which he sought judicial recognition that the loan debt owed to sallie mae was originally a community obligation and thus solidary.eventually,bayhi stipulated to this,and the state court entered a judgment to that effect in june.
despite entry of this judgment,however,bayhi still did not resume paying her half of the loan payments to sallie mae.so,in december,aguiluz filed a petition for specific performance in state court in which he sought an order mandating that bayhi pay her half of the payments to sallie mae pursuant to the june judgment of the state court importantly,aguiluz did not allege that he had made her payments and did not seek to recover any such amounts through contribution he sought only to force her to pay her virile portion directly to sallie mae.
unable to resolve that litigation amicably,aguiluz filed a motion for summary judgment almost three years after initiating the action.following oral argument and supplemental briefing,the state court granted aguiluz motion and entered judgment in his favor in february,directing bayhi to resume making half of the loan payments directly to sallie mae no mention of repaying aguiluz.this was more than five years after the closing of her bankruptcy case,during which time bayhi had paid nothing to sallie mae,despite the of her solidary liability on the loan.
the state court order did not quell bayhi penchant for litigation in march,without prior notice to aguiluz,bayhi filed ex parte motions in the bankruptcy court to reopen her case pursuant to united states code,title,b and to hold aguiluz in contempt and sanction him.bayhi contended that aguiluz had knowingly and willfully violated the bankruptcy court discharge order by seeking to force her to make her share of the payments to sallie mae on the undischarged loan obligation.bayhi took the position that it was the agreement that had created a debt from her to aguiluz,which was separate and distinct from their solidary debt to sallie mae and from their correlative rights to contribution.bayhi advanced that,as all her debts to aguiluz were discharged,his state court actions were in violation of the discharge order.
in response to bayhi motions,the bankruptcy court reopened the case and scheduled a hearing for contempt and sanctions.at the conclusion of that hearing,the bankruptcy court stated for the record that it found aguiluz to be in contempt of court,but the court did not sanction him.without specifically mentioning the loan and its creation of the parties solidary debt to sallie mae,the bankruptcy court ruled that it was the agreement that created bayhi obligation to pay of each installment on the loan and aguiluz concomitant right to recover for any payments that he might ever have to make toward her share.the court expressly ruled that the obligation created by the agreement was a debt that bayhi owed to aguiluz,presumably separate and distinct from the debt that the former spouses still owed to sallie mae in solido.
the court further ruled that aguiluz failure to file a a exception to the discharge of this debt allowed it to be discharged.finally,finding that aguiluz was acting neither on sallie mae behalf nor as its subrogee or assignee,the court concluded that aguiluz actions were an attempt to preserve his own claim,in violation of the discharge order.after giving its reasons orally,the bankruptcy court concluded with 
that it.that concludes this matter.grand bayhi counsel,you need to submit a judgment.i suggest you communicate with aguiluz acting pro se on the terms of the order with regard to the breath sic of what can and what can not be done in state court.if you all can not reach an agreement on that,you can call me and we have a status conference or we have another hearing.
on march,the bankruptcy court entered a written minute entry directing that the parties will communicate to agree on a jointly proposed order.
notwithstanding these clear instructions,for bayhi submitted an ex parte proposed order on march without ever having communicated with aguiluz and without apprising the bankruptcy court that counsel had not done so.understandably presuming the order to have been agreed on by both parties,the bankruptcy court signed and entered it that same day.on april,after he became aware of this unprofessional conduct by bayhi counsel,aguiluz filed a motion in the bankruptcy court to alter or amend its order.following briefing and a hearing,the court obliged,entering an amended order on july.
pursuant to a,the bankruptcy court amended order held aguiluz in contempt but did not assess sanctions,enjoined him from taking any action to collect bayhi share of the loan payments,and vacated the february state court judgment which had ordered bayhi to make her payments to sallie mae,not to repay anything to aguiluz.aguiluz properly appealed this order to the district court.
in her appellee brief to the district court,bayhi contended that the bankruptcy court had correctly decided the case as a matter of law and also asserted that aguiluz appeal was untimely.without ever deciding the timeliness issue,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order for the same reasons that the court had given orally.aguiluz timely filed a notice of appeal to us.
ii.law and analysis 
timeliness 
although raised by neither party on appeal,we note sua sponte,as we must,that there is an unanswered question as to our aguiluz timely filed his notice of appeal of the bankruptcy court judgment to the district court.thus,before reaching the merits of this appeal,we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction.
under rule a of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,a party seeking to appeal a bankruptcy court judgment to a district court has ten days following entry of the bankruptcy court judgment to file a notice of appeal with the bankruptcy clerk failure to file a notice of appeal timely deprives the district court of jurisdiction to consider that appeal and,in turn,deprives us of jurisdiction to consider an appeal from the ruling of the district court given its jurisdictional nature,this requirement can not be waived 
in his brief to the district court,bayhi lawyer asserted that aguiluz appeal clock started to run on april,and that his notice of appeal was filed on august,and thus was untimely.both assertions were unprofessionally incorrect.
rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,which references federal rule of civil procedure,allows a party ten days from entry of judgment to file a motion to alter or amend that judgment if a party timely files such a motion,the time for filing a notice of appeal will not commence to run until the entry of the order granting or denying such motion 
here,the bankruptcy court entered its initial order on march.aguiluz filed his motion to alter or amend on april,which might appear to be eleven days after the order but,as april was a sunday,aguiluz had until the next day to file his motion therefore,the running of aguiluz time within which to file a notice of appeal to the district court was tolled until the bankruptcy court acted on his motion 
on july,the bankruptcy court entered its amended order.in turn,aguiluz filed his notice of appeal with the bankruptcy clerk on july.as the day of entry is not counted,july was the tenth day after entry of the amended order thus,aguiluz appeal to the district court was timely,and we have jurisdiction to address the substance of this appeal.
abstention 
the bankruptcy court was not authorized to vacate the state court five judgment.under the doctrine,the lower federal courts are without any to modify or reverse a judgment rendered by a state court although there is an exception that allows vacatur of a state court judgment that violates a discharge order we demonstrate infra that the state court judgment here did not violate the bankruptcy court discharge order for the obvious reason that the solidary debt to sallie mae that produced aguiluz contribution right was not discharged.thus,as the discharge exception to is inapt,the state court or immunized by that doctrine from vacatur or any other restraints by the bankruptcy court,the district court,and this court.
standard of review 
we review a bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo when a district court has affirmed the bankruptcy court factual findings,we will reverse only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that an error was made 
applicable law 
if a claim for payment were to be asserted against bayhi by sallie mae,the loan would be collectible from her because it was per se under a and nothing in required sallie mae to file a claim to determine.here,we must decide whether aguiluz right to seek contribution stems from the parties undischarged debt to sallie mae or as the bankruptcy court ruled,from the agreement putative creation of a separate and distinct debt owed to him by bayhi and subsequently discharged.
when it vacated the state court judgment,enjoined aguiluz from seeking contribution of bayhi virile share of the loan payments,and found aguiluz in contempt,the bankruptcy court based its reasoning and holding entirely on its foundational premise that the duty owed by bayhi to aguiluz in contribution for her failure to pay sallie mae her virile portion of the loan was a debt that was created in the agreement and was thus distinct from their solidary debt to sallie mae least by their reciprocal rights as principal to compel contribution inter se.this premise led the bankruptcy court to rule that aguiluz state court actions to compel bayhi to contribute her virile portion of the loan payments to sallie mae not to repay aguiluz for anything he may have paid on her behalf violated a of the bankruptcy code.as we shall demonstrate,the court starting bayhi duty of contribution owed to aguiluz was created by the flawed.like the proverbial poison tree and its fruit,therefore,this fallacy caused all rulings constructed on that foundation to be equally flawed and thus reversible error.here why.
section a provides that a discharge voids any judgment at any time obtained,to the extent that such judgment is a determination of the personal liability of the debtor with respect to any debt discharged under section,and operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action,the employment of process,or an act,to collect,recover or offset any such discharged debt as a personal liability of the debtor.thus,the operable question on appeal is whether aguiluz right to seek contribution from bayhi by making her pay sallie mae her virile portion of their solidary obligation to it was a debt discharged under section.if it was,the bankruptcy court had the authority to rule as it did conversely,if aguiluz right to require contribution from bayhi was not discharged because her underlying solidary obligation to sallie mae was not discharged,the bankruptcy court exceeded its authority and committed reversible error.we hold the latter to be the case.
as noted,the bankruptcy court made two erroneous determinations in reaching its conclusion aguiluz and bayhi respective rights to compel contribution were creatures of the agreement,not of the loan and the obligation of each party to the other to pay sallie mae of the loan was separate and distinct a feature solidary loan debt to sallie mae.we address these errors in sequence.
source of right to contribution 
as noted,the bankruptcy court erred in determining that aguiluz right to enforce contribution from bayhi if she defaulted toward sallie mae arose from a new debt created in the agreement.for it was not the agreement that created the loan,made it a community obligation,and produced aguiluz and bayhi correlative rights and duties as solidary,including the right of each to compel contribution the agreement did nothing more than recognize and continuing rights and duties that had arisen by operation of louisiana law back when the parties took out the loan during the existences of their marriage and of their community property regime.
under louisiana community property law as now conceded by bayhi,the loan from sallie mae created a community obligation ab initio,because it was incurred during the marriage for the common interests of the spouses as such,the spouses became solidary to sallie mae and therefore subject to all features of such a legal relationship under louisiana law.neither their divorce nor the agreement changed that in any way.indeed only an affirmative act of their obligee,sallie mae,or a formal novation by the two,could do that.
the loan was a solidary obligation of the parties and remains so so sallie mae always had,and continues to have,the right to demand the whole performance from either aguiluz or bayhi again,neither their divorce nor the agreement altered this.another immutable feature of solidary liability for the loan is the correlative rights and duties of the inter se.as principal or primary solidary principal and aguiluz and bayhi are each vested by louisiana law with the right to compel contribution by the other to the extent of the other virile portion,which,when there are two,is of the obligation the agreement did nothing more than acknowledge this truism,the existence and nature of the loan as a solidary community obligation that survived divorce and,absent a novation,survived any settlement of the community assets and liabilities of the former spouses,whether contractual or.the concomitant rights and duties of each former spouse,including the right of each to enforce contribution for the loan obligation,was established automatically when they made the loan,not subsequently when they entered the agreement.to either create new rights or transmute existing ones,the agreement would either have had to have contained express renunciations of such rights and duties which it did not or have been a novation which it was not.by definition,a novation extinguishes existing,the loan,not the rights and duties of the obligors inter substituting a new obligation for the old one and the intent to extinguish the original obligation must be clear and unequivocal,never presumed as the bankruptcy court might have done here 
the agreement thus had no meaningful effect on the parties obligations to sallie mae under the loan or on the correlative rights and duties between the parties.the agreement was in no way a novation it neither created new or modified or clearly and unequivocally extinguished old ones.the agreement was at most an acknowledgment of the status quo and a verbalization of the mechanics for discharging the parties existing obligation to sallie mae in a manner consistent with their correlative rights under the doctrine of contribution.
indeed,if,following bayhi discharge,aguiluz had merely defaulted on the loan and sallie mae had made judicial demand on him alone,he would have had express legal authority under the civil code to join bayhi as a third party defendant and seek contribution for her share of the loan,present,and of the agreement and regardless of the discharge of any debts arising from it this further illustrates the distinction between prospective contribution as sought by aguiluz under which there is no requirement that one of the primary who seeks it from another primary obligor must have first paid the creditor and reimbursement under which a who is the surety,must first have paid the creditor the cases cited by the dissent in footnotes and are inapposite as they address situations in which the sought to recoup past payments,not to compel direct payment to the common creditor,as did aguiluz.
we thus can not credit the dissent position that actual payment by the is the prerequisite for any contribution claim in or out of bankruptcy with respect,the dissent is mistaken to insist that aguiluz right to contribution was inchoate,and thus his assertion of it premature,if indeed he had not paid any portion of bayhi share of the loan obligation or had not yet been sued by sallie mae on the loan obligation 
such an argument fails for at least two reasons.first,it ignores the fact that aguiluz expressly sought state court relief under louisiana declaratory judgment law as codified in the louisiana code of civil procedure,which provides a juridical vehicle for obtaining a determination of rights before the occurrence of a default or a lawsuit,and thus eschews any prerequisite of having made payments or suffered a money judgment to be taken.second,louisiana civil code article expressly allows a sued to enforce contribution by impleading the recalcitrant as a defendant and the sued need not have paid anything to their suing common creditor before thus impleading his.nowhere does the civil code make a demand by the creditor,much less the filing of a lawsuit by the creditor,a condition precedent to compelling contribution.
in addition,negative practical and policy effects would flow from vacating the state court judgment in this instance.if this hypothetical prematurity assertion of the dissent never asserted by bayhi were enforced,in aguiluz predicament would be in the posture of choosing either to default on the debt or pay it off before seeking to recoup those payments from a like bayhi.the former course of action would obviously do harm to the credit rating and the business or professional reputation of in aguiluz situation,and would also create additional,piecemeal litigation.the latter course of action might well present an insurmountable cash flow burden to most.we can see no basis for preventing aguiluz from doing via a declaratory judgment before being sued by sallie mae that which he is expressly authorized to do by after being sued by sallie mae,impleading bayhi to force contribution.and,it must be remembered that contribution is a legal right and comes into existence at the moment the solidary debt is created,always,per force,in advance of any payment or to the common obligee.
debt between the parties separate from the loan 
the bankruptcy court second but interrelated foundational error was in concluding that aguiluz right to compel contribution by bayhi was a debt and that it was separate and distinct from the debt that they owed in solido to sallie mae.our decision in in re fields extirpates the bankruptcy court position on this point 
in fields,hartford the debtor surety had issued a surety bond to fields the debtor covering his permit issued by the state of texas the creditor.this bond obligated hartford to pay all fees,taxes,and penalties levied by the texas alcoholic beverages commission to the extent fields might fail to pay them thereafter,fields filed for bankruptcy and subsequently failed to pay taxes covered by the surety bond as fields surety,hartford paid texas the amount owing 
in his bankruptcy case,fields properly listed his,hartford,as a creditor,just as bayhi listed her,aguiluz,as a creditor like both aguiluz and sallie mae here,hartford did not timely file a c complaint to confirm under united states code,title when hartford did eventually file such a complaint,fields moved to dismiss it as untimely the bankruptcy court denied the motion,determining that,because hartford claim was grounded in fields tax debt to texas,which was per se under a a,hartford right to reimbursement via subrogation was likewise as there is no legal distinction between a dischargeability complaint like hartford and one not filed at all like sallie mae and aguiluz,the clear lesson of this holding is that no c complaint by a hartford there aguiluz here is required when the debt owed to the common creditor texas there sallie mae here is expressly under a subsection of a of the bankruptcy code.
on appeal,we affirmed the fields bankruptcy court.we agreed that,as texas tax claim was by an express exception in the bankruptcy code,hartford,as fields surety,did not need to file a complaint to have determined.it is in the distinction between the narrow set of statutorily debts such as those particularly identified in a on the one hand,and tort or contractual debts that may or may not be held by the court to be dischargeable based on the degree of heinousness of the acts of the debtor in generating such debts on the other hand,wherein lies the overarching disagreement between the panel majority and the dissent in this case unlike the dissent,we of the panel majority conclude that per se,automatically debts need not be claimed as exceptions to discharge,even though the vast majority of debts for which a creditor seeks must be affirmatively asserted,litigated,and ruled on by the bankruptcy court.the instant case and fields involve statutorily debts of the kind that need not be expressly asserted in the bankruptcy proceedings or ruled on by the bankruptcy court to retain their.
pursuant to a a,we acknowledged that fields debt to texas was and remained.next,we determined that state law not the provisions of the surety bond subrogated hartford to the state rights as a creditor.this allowed hartford to pursue reimbursement from fields to the same extent that texas could have pursued fields in its own right.the essence of our holding in fields can be succinctly put a joint and several obligor in texas like a solidary obligor in louisiana who pays or is liable for his statutorily debt is subrogated to the rights of the as a matter of law,provided the relevant state law recognizes principles of subrogation,as do both texas and louisiana.as a louisiana solidary is legally subrogated to the rights of the creditor,he may seek contribution if he is a or reimbursement if he is a surety to the same extent as could the creditor from the otherwise discharged debtor who is not,however,discharged on that particular debt.
such rights continue to exist even when other debts that might have been owed directly by one solidary to the other are discharged in bankruptcy this is because the solidary is not seeking payment of a discharged debt owed to him,but is instead seeking to enforce his correlative rights that flow as a matter of law from his continuing relationship with the otherwise discharged party as a on a,more importantly,a per se obligation to a third party.
the automatically student loan here is legally indistinguishable from the automatically tax obligation in fields.like fields tax debt,bayhi debt to sallie mae was shielded from discharge vel non by a.thus,by seeking to enforce contribution against bayhi after she failed to perform her obligation to sallie mae,aguiluz was asserting his rights as a solidary on the and loan debt he was not asserting rights of a direct creditor of bayhi on some discharged debt,as the bankruptcy court concluded.indeed,when bayhi filed for bankruptcy protection,she was current on her virile portion of the debt to sallie mae not one cent of her bankruptcy estate assets has ever been or will ever be paid to sallie mae or to aguiluz.
at least for purposes of this case,there is no legal or functional difference between of a debt for state taxes pursuant to a a fields and of a debt for a student loan pursuant to a the instant case.under either subsection,a creditor need never file an exception to discharge,because bankruptcy law makes these and other a exceptions.thus,a person like aguiluz,who derives his state law rights from a statutorily debt to a a creditor here sallie mae,need not file an exception any more than hartford needed to file one for its state law rights derived from the tax debt to the state of texas,a a a creditor.
it follows inescapably that aguiluz efforts to compel contribution from bayhi in state court,and that court rendering of the declaratory judgment and order of specific performance,were not done with respect to any debt discharged.as such,aguiluz did not violate the bankruptcy court discharge order and thus did not provide any basis for that court purported vacating of the state court judgment even if we assume arguendo that it could have done so without violating the doctrine,enjoining future efforts by aguiluz to enforce contribution against bayhi,or holding aguiluz in contempt 
iii.conclusion 
when stripped of their rhetoric and reduced to their essentials,this admittedly verbose and redundant opinion and the succinct dissenting opinion boil down to but a single serious disagreement.that disagreement is not about the efficacy of the doctrine which the dissent does not address,is not about whether aguiluz had to have paid all or part of bayhi virile share of the loan to sallie mae before he could seek to compel contribution from her,and is not about any of the intricacies of louisiana substantive or procedural law rather,the core disagreement is whether as the dissent insists,aguiluz had to appear in the bankruptcy court to assert his claim to contribution despite its flowing from the statutorily debt that aguiluz and bayhi owed in solido to sallie mae,or as this opinion for the panel majority holds today,aguiluz like sallie mae did not have to assert his prospective contribution rights in bayhi bankruptcy proceedings,depending as he does and must on the statutory a per se of the underlying solidary obligation to sallie mae.we are convinced that the latter is the case for the reasons extensively set forth above,especially the distinction between obligations that are statutorily exempt from discharge,such as those listed in a,and debts the of which must be filed for and granted or denied by the court.
based on the applicable law of louisiana,the bankruptcy code,the applicable case law,and our extensive review of the parties briefs and the record on appeal,we hold that the bankruptcy court exceeded the authority granted to it by a and also violated the doctrine in the process when it purported to vacate the relevant state court judgments and to enjoin the commencement of any future collection attempts by aguiluz.it follows that the court abused its discretion as well when it held aguiluz in contempt.accordingly,we reverse the judgments of the bankruptcy court and district court,and we remand this action to the bankruptcy court with instructions for it to lift its vacatur of the state court judgments and to vacate its contempt order and its injunction of future efforts by aguiluz to enforce his right of contribution as bayhi solidary on the and undischarged debt to sallie mae.
reversed and remanded with instructions.
i concur in the vacatur of the contempt judgment against aguiluz,because i believe that he pursued his action in louisiana state court in an attempt to do no more than compel bayhi not to pay him but to pay sallie mae her undischarged share of the couple student loan debt.in asserting that novel claim,aguiluz did not intentionally violate his discharge order and should not be subject to civil contempt for violation of the a discharge injunction.
i dissent,however,from the holding that the state court judgment must be reinstated.it is an end run around bayhi discharge for aguiluz to seek to compel her to pay sallie mae.the only consequence of the state court judgment is to relieve aguiluz of the threat he would otherwise face that sallie mae will come after him rather than bayhi because of his on the debt.the action effected a de facto partition of the sallie mae liability from his standpoint.had aguiluz sought this relief from his during her bankruptcy,it would have been a claim that might well have been discharged.i say might because this is a novel situation.
what is not novel here is that aguiluz was required to appear in the bankruptcy court to assert his claim.the term claim is defined as broadly as possible by the bankruptcy code,to effectuate the broadest possible relief for the debtor.see matter of southmark,cir moreover,the bankruptcy code explicitly deals with claims for contribution among.see a.whether it ultimately proved to be contingent or matured,allowed,disallowed,or nondischargeable,however,aguiluz had a claim against his wife bankruptcy estate,and he was required to pursue that claim in bankruptcy court.because he did not pursue it,the claim is barred.
the majority reason that because the underlying debt is for a nondischargeable student loan,aguiluz could ignore the bankruptcy case,refuse to file a proof of claim,and seek his independent declaratory judgment in state court.he could thus assume the status of the student loan as to nondischargeability of his contribution claim and as to the fact that sallie mae need not file a proof of claim.a.
the first proposition is dubious on this record the second is wrong.
first,the record is curiously silent as to whether,and how much,aguiluz may have paid on his share of the sallie mae debt.the majority assumes he has been paying her share,see footnote,but there is no substantiation in the record or in aguiluz pleadings and briefs for their speculation.yet actual payment by the is the prerequisite for any contribution claim in or out of bankruptcy aguiluz claim can not functionally assume sallie mae status if he has made no payments on bayhi behalf 
second,there is no support for the majority conclusion that aguiluz could bypass bankruptcy court in making his contribution claim against bayhi.in in re fields,cir,this court ruled on a nondischargeability contest arising between the debtor and a surety who had fully paid the debtor state liquor taxes.the surety was indeed subrogated to the nondischargeability of the state tax,but it filed a complaint in bankruptcy court to assure its status.all of the cases fields cites followed the same procedure.see id.at.
bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction to determine all claims against the debtor.they must decide the status of contribution claims in order to prevent double recovery against a debtor estate and because such claims,like any others,may be subject to defenses or limitations assertable by the debtor.aguiluz appeared in the bankruptcy case,but he filed neither a proof of claim nor a complaint to determine the nondischargeability of his contribution claim against bayhi.had the claim been simply contingent at the time,it might well have been subject to disallowance,because the code discharges a debtor from such obligations.e b whether,in this case,some consequence of louisiana law or the nondischargeability of the underlying debt would alter the substantive outcome are novel questions.but these questions go to the nature of a contribution claim between the debtor and a.they existed at the date of bankruptcy they are within the bankruptcy court jurisdiction and they could and should have been litigated there initially.because aguiluz neither asserted his claim nor received a declaration of its nondischargeability,he forfeited it.aguiluz later state court action interfered with bayhi discharge,and its judgment should be vacated.
the majority would wipe out bankruptcy court jurisdiction on the theory that aguiluz holds a special position as the on a nondischargeable debt.my point is that no matter what position sallie mae holds by statute the bankruptcy,a contribution claim runs only between.in subrogation,by contrast,the steps formally into the shoes,and accedes to the rights and remedies,of the creditor.the majority disavows reliance on subrogation or reimbursement in favor of calling this a contribution claim.but treating it as such,nothing in the comprehensive scope of bankruptcy jurisdiction authorizes aguiluz to refrain from asserting his claim for contribution against bayhi in bankruptcy court.
unfortunately,the majority err not only in analyzing the contribution claim but even more fundamentally,in understanding what claim aguiluz makes.he nowhere purports to litigate a contribution claim.instead,when aguiluz describes his right,he calls it a right of subrogation.i assume he means what he says,and his actual claim dooms the majority approach.in bankruptcy,a creditor who is a may assert a claim for contribution or subrogation,but not both.b.as a subrogation claim,aguiluz assertion would fail under bankruptcy law and many states law because he received consideration for the claim held by the creditor.b.as the majority concede,aguiluz benefitted from the community student loan.moreover,a subrogation claim would not have been allowed unless aguiluz fully paid the sallie mae debt.in re fields is thus substantively as well as procedurally distinguishable because the surety there had paid the full liquor tax and had clearly received no prior benefit from the creditor 
the majority analysis and result,in short,condone a clever avoidance of the broad scope of bankruptcy court jurisdiction and amount to a complete of the case in favor of aguiluz.aguiluz had a chance to seek a remedy in bankruptcy court bayhi has had no chance to respond to the majority views the majority worries about aguiluz financial condition,but we have no basis to assess the ultimate equities without any evidence that aguiluz has had to pay any of his wife share of the student loan debt.
the better result in this case would be to vacate the state court judgment,dismiss the contempt citation,and pretermit the majority gratuitous and hitherto unlitigated primer on louisiana law and procedure.
i respectfully dissent.
