on june,before responding to the outstanding order to show cause,gallop moved to disqualify the panel,pursuant to.and a,from considering her petition for rehearing and rehearing in banc.see mot.to disqualify veale aff.the motion,which was signed by william veale stated that the panel should be disqualified due to evident severe bias,based in active personal emotions arising from the attack leading to a categorical prejudgment totally rejecting gallop complaint,out of hand and with palpable animus in its decision.mot.to disqualify at.in addition to signing the motion to disqualify,veale also provided a supporting affidavit,in which he further demanded not only that the three panel members who heard gallop appeal recuse themselves from future participation in the case,but also that any other members of the bench of this circuit who share their feelings do the same.id.veale aff.see also id.veale aff.reiterating that the panel members and any colleagues must be recused.the affidavit was also peppered with disdainful and unsubstantiated conclusions about the panel members emotional stability and competence to serve objectively.see,id.veale aff,alleging that the court had engaged in a rank,dishonest wielding of ordained power,and that the participation of one member in particular was so egregious that it would or should provoke a congressional investigation.
on july,in a second published opinion,gallop cheney,cir per curiam gallop ii,we denied gallop motion to disqualify the panel,denied her petition for panel rehearing,and ordered william veale to show cause in writing within days from the date of entry of that order why the court should not impose additional sanctions against him for his role in drafting the motion to disqualify and accompanying affidavit.gallop ii,at.pursuant to the terms of the proposed additional sanctions,veale would be required to provide appropriate notice to any federal court before which he appears of any sanctions imposed against him in connection with this appeal.id.
on july,and august,respectively,gallop and her team of attorneys submitted their responses to our orders to show cause of april,and july.
dennis cunningham,gallop lead counsel of record,states in his affirmation in response to our april,order to show cause that he is not currently admitted to practice before this court because,although previously admitted,he was dropped from the rolls without notice.appellants mem.in response to the court april,order imposing sanctions appellants mem.response cunningham aff.he states that he was substantially the decider in the development of the case,and author of the pleadings at issue here,and moves to be admitted pro hac vice for the purposes of this appeal,so that in considering sanctions we may assign the blame herein to whom it mainly belongs.id.cunningham aff.
cunningham motion to be admitted pro hac vice is hereby granted.
in gallop i,we affirmed the dismissal of gallop complaint by the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,judge the complaint had alleged that on september,a bomb was detonated inside the pentagon,that no plane hit the pentagon,and that various identified united states civilian and military leaders knew about the attacks in advance,assisted in their planning,and subsequently covered up the government involvement.see gallop i,at.we found the district court dismissal of the complaint appropriate because it consisted of speculation and conjecture and fail ed to set forth a consistent,much less plausible,theory for what actually happened on september,and further failed to present anything beyond vague and conclusory allegations of conspiracy among the defendants.id.at.we then ordered gallop and her attorneys to show cause why they should not be sanctioned for forcing the court to consider,and the government to defend,a frivolous and vexatious appeal.id.at.
the response of gallop and her attorneys to our april,order to show cause fails to demonstrate that this appeal was anything but frivolous.like other papers submitted by gallop and her team of attorneys in this appeal,the response presents only irrelevant information in a jarringly disorganized manner,united solely by its consistently patronizing tone.the response is a comprehensive compilation of every rumor,report,statement,and anecdote that may reveal an inconsistency or omission in an official version of the attacks,such as the commission report final report on the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states,available at http despite this effort,gallop and her attorneys neglect to explain how or why these random accounts even assuming they reveal inconsistencies or omissions in the official story provide a sufficient basis for pursuing an appeal of gallop claims against defendants.as such,the response fails to show why the appeal was not frivolous,see gallop i,at.
moreover,the response contains a robust collection of unsupported accusations of bias against the court.for example,it accuses the court of an untoward,actionably biased judicial response to gallop claims,angry,and participation or at least acquiescence in the ongoing government conspiracy regarding the events of.appellants mem.response at.
turning first to the question of whether sanctions are appropriate against gallop,we note that she is not an attorney and thus has not assumed the ethical obligations that her attorneys owe to this court.additionally,the record before us reveals that gallop did not spearhead her litigation strategy,but rather relied heavily upon her attorneys to draft the relevant documents and provide advice in pursuing this litigation.see,appellants mem.response at describing cunningham as the principal author of the plaintiffs pleadings here and in the district court id.gallop aff.i understand from my attorneys that a s explained by my lawyers.
under the circumstances,we decline to impose sanctions on gallop at this time.in re porto,cir t he rule that the sins of the lawyer are visited on the client does not apply in th e context of sanctions,and a court must specify conduct of the client herself that is bad enough to subject her to sanctions.rather,gallop is hereby admonished that the submission of future frivolous filings,either as a pro se litigant or one represented by counsel,may result in sanctions being imposed on her by the courts,including the imposition of restrictions,requirements of notice to other federal courts,and monetary penalties.
turning to the question of whether sanctions are appropriate against gallop attorneys,the record before us reflects that this team of lawyers multiplie d the proceedings in this case unreasonably and vexatiously,see also fed.rule providing for sanctions where a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous.see generally gallop ii,at gallop i,at appellants mem.response.the record also reflects that gallop attorneys repeatedly and in bad faith accused the court of bias,malice,and general impropriety.see,appellants mem.response at.
accordingly,pursuant to our authority under,rule,and the inherent power of this court,we hereby order,adjudge,and decree that dennis cunningham,mustapha ndanusa,and william veale shall pay the government double costs in addition to damages in the amount of,for which they are jointly and severally liable,within days of the date of entry of this order.it is further ordered that unless such payment is timely made,attorneys dennis cunningham,mustapha ndanusa,and william veale shall be required to request leave from this court before f
