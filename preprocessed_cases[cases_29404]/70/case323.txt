in the underlying litigation,the securities and exchange commission sec sought,and was granted,an order freezing the assets of charles homa.in this appeal,paul jones and david pollock,nonparties to the underlying action,appeal a judgment of contempt for failing to comply with that freeze order caribbean ventures international,another nonparty,appeals a default judgment imposed as a sanction for failure to comply with discovery requests and the consequent appointment of phillip stenger as receiver over its assets for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.
between and,charles homa operated an automobile title lending business called cash titles.sunset financial services,was the marketing company for the various entities.the entities actually operated a huge ponzi scheme the loss by innocent investors exceeded.
on october,the sec filed a civil enforcement suit the sec action against homa the suit accused homa of civil fraud in violation of united states securities laws at that time,the united states department of justice also brought criminal charges against homa for securities laws violations 
the sec promptly sought freeze orders for all the assets.the court granted the motions and issued two freeze orders.the first was entered on october.that order initially froze the assets of the defendants in the sec action a second freeze order,issued october,froze any bank account in which any of the defendants had signatory authority or beneficial interest,including and banc caribe.
on november,stenger was appointed receiver over the assets of homa,sunset financial and other affiliated entities,including the interests of any individuals or entities that constituted property in banc caribe.the receiver general mandate was to marshal receivership property for distribution to the injured investors.
pollock and jones met and became friends in.pollock is a citizen of the united states who maintained a florida driver license until at least september,and who currently resides in lucia,an independent country within the british commonwealth.from until,pollock resided in dominica,another island nation in the caribbean sea.pollock continuously maintained,through at least january of,an accounting practice with a post office box address in winter park,florida.
paul morgan jones is a citizen of the united states who maintains a florida driver license.from until,jones also resided in dominica.jones carries both a united states and a dominica passport.
in the early,mark ellison invited pollock to dominica to look at a large tract of land,point round,that ellison sought to develop.the development did not occur.in,pollock learned from reginald shillingford,a part owner of point round,that dominica had enacted new legislation permitting offshore banking and financial industry development.pollock became interested in financing a bank in dominica.
pollock first learned of homa through his brother.in march,pollock met in florida with homa and several other potential investors.they discussed the tract of land in dominica and the possibility of starting a bank to assist in the development of the property.
pollock then prepared a written document,the prospectus to solicit homa investment in the bank that he and jones hoped to finance in dominica,banc caribe.the prospectus contemplated a minimum of shares at per share for a total of and reflected an ultimate goal of raising a maximum of in equity for the bank.pollock again met with homa on april,in florida.at that time,pollock presented homa with the banc caribe prospectus homa indicated that he was interested in the proposal and that he would like to meet jones.
pollock,jones and homa met together in may.shortly thereafter,homa indicated that he would pursue the banc caribe plans with pollock and jones,but that he wanted no other partners or investors in the project.pollock and jones agreed.
the precise terms of homa investment in the banc caribe project are uncertain.the parties never signed a contract or otherwise reduced their agreement to writing.moreover,as we shall discuss below,throughout the venture the parties ignored the terms of other documentation created during the banc caribe project.in the district court,pollock identified at least three possible sources for determining the terms of the agreement between himself,jones and homa the prospectus,the investment promissory notes and oral conversations with homa.these three sources are in conflict regarding key terms of the agreement 
after homa indicated his intention to go forward with banc caribe,pollock and jones worked quickly to establish an offshore account through which homa could transfer large amounts of money out of the united states.pollock first created caribbean ventures international,caribbean ventures as a holding company for the bank equity.the shares of caribbean ventures were held by shillingford,who also was a director of caribbean ventures.pollock and jones filled the remaining director positions in caribbean ventures.
pollock,jones and homa planned to put the funds from the offering into caribbean ventures and then have caribbean ventures apply for a banking license in dominica so that banc caribe could become a legal entity.then,the funds in caribbean ventures would be transferred to banc caribe and shares in the bank would be issued,possibly pursuant to the terms of the offering in the prospectus in accordance with this plan,on june,homa,through sunset financial,wire transferred his initial investment in banc caribe to the account of caribbean ventures at the commercial bank of dominica.on march,homa invested a second installment of in the same manner.
pollock then drafted an investment promissory note that documented homa first investment of in banc caribe he later drafted a second note with identical terms for the second investment of.these notes served as the second alleged source of the terms of the agreement between pollock,jones and homa.notably,homa took no part in the creation of the notes,never signed them and did not have possession of them.jones also had no knowledge of the notes he did not see them until.the true purpose of the notes was to support the bank license application and to prove to the regulators in dominica that banc caribe had met the minimum requirement of in unrestricted capital.
on june,pollock,jones and caribbean ventures filed banc caribe articles of incorporation with the government of dominica.on august,banc caribe filed its application with dominica.when it applied for its license,banc caribe was funded with,the minimum capital requirement under the law of dominica.it opened for business shortly thereafter.
homa,through sunset financial,later paid an additional to caribbean ventures,for a total investment of in banc caribe.no other investment promissory notes were prepared to document this subsequent investment from homa.banc caribe did not receive a capital contribution from any source other than homa.caribbean ventures owned all the stock of banc caribe.
pollock identified the third source of the agreement between the parties as a series of conversations with homa.pollock was inconsistent in his representations to the court regarding which of these three sources of the agreement controlled on any given point,and the court found him to be entirely without credibility 
banc caribe began doing business in september,subject to the banking laws of dominica.jones served as its president and secretary,and pollock served as the managing director and chief financial officer.pollock leased approximately square feet of space for the bank,and its doors officially opened in october.in january,homa was designated as the chairman of the board of directors of banc caribe.
on october,the sec brought a civil suit against homa and,the combined entities.the district court entered the first freeze order against homa and on that day,and a second,clarifying order on october.by that time,banc caribe had between and accounts,and it had expanded to fifteen employees.
sunset financial,one of homa corporate entities that was specifically mentioned in the freeze orders,had an account at banc caribe sunset financial account held approximately of the in total deposits in banc caribe.homa also controlled other entities,however,including caribbean air and caribbean realty,that had accounts at banc caribe.the total funds that could be attributed to homa,therefore,accounted for more than of the deposits in the bank.
the record suggests that pollock and jones first became aware of homa legal trouble when,on october,pollock saw an article in a florida newspaper concerning the sec action against homa.that article described allegations that homa had been laundering money from an international ponzi scheme.
pollock and jones met in dominica to discuss the situation and decided to ask homa to resign from the board of directors.they called homa on october,and homa agreed to resign.homa allegedly did not inform pollock of the freeze order at that time.on october,pollock and jones held an emergency meeting of banc caribe board of directors and removed homa as a director of the bank 
on october,banc caribe also attempted to initiate a transaction with dain rauscher,one of banc caribe correspondent banks dain rauscher informed pollock that there was a problem with banc caribe account.pollock learned from dain rauscher legal department that the account was locked.pollock knew at that time that the problem stemmed from a freeze order.at on october,dain rausher faxed a copy of the october freeze order to pollock and jones.
sometime after receipt of the order,jones,with the knowledge and authorization of pollock,directed that paine webber wire transfer out of banc caribe paine webber correspondent banking account in the united states to banc caribe correspondent banking account at alpha credit bank in athens,greece the funds actually were transferred to the alpha credit bank on october,and the transfer likely was ordered on that day.the transfer lacked any business reason it was initiated solely to circumvent the freeze order.
sometime thereafter,pollock retained an attorney for banc caribe.banc caribe began negotiating with the sec on october.on october,the sec and banc caribe entered into a resolution regarding the transfer of certain assets and the repatriation of others held in banc caribe for the benefit of entities.this accommodation ensured that banc caribe had the liquidity that pollock believed it needed to function.
sometime between october and,caribbean ventures determined that homa,because of his legal difficulties,would be unable to invest the full amount that pollock testified homa had agreed to contribute.therefore,caribbean ventures determined that homa was in default and cancelled the notes.pollock and jones were the sole officers of caribbean ventures,but jones did not take part in cancelling the notes.additionally,pollock did not tell homa,sunset financial or anyone else that homa was in default or that the notes had been cancelled.neither pollock nor jones ever informed the sec of homa rights under the agreement,the existence of any agreement or that caribbean ventures unilaterally had determined to cancel the notes.pollock and jones also failed to inform the district court,sec or any other authority that they had voided unilaterally homa right to bank ownership and to the money he had invested in the bank through these actions,pollock and jones effectively transferred to themselves all the value represented by homa investment in banc caribe.this transfer occurred after pollock and jones had actual notice of the freeze orders.
pollock also closed homa sunset financial account.between october and,before closing the account,pollock invoked banc caribe right to against sunset financial account.he offset from homa sunset financial account over the course of four withdrawals no one contacted the sec or the district court before making the withdrawals.these occurred after pollock and jones received actual notice of the freeze orders,and the money was taken from the account of sunset financial,an account over which homa had signatory authority.
one of the from sunset financial account related to a home that homa had arranged to purchase through banc caribe banc caribe declared homa to be in default on the home lease,even though no payments had been missed.the bank asserted that an accelerated lease payment of was immediately due,and it removed the money from sunset financial account banc caribe had no rights under the lease,however,which was purportedly between homa and caribbean realty.pollock did not accelerate caribbean realty lease payments instead,he went directly to homa money in the sunset financial account.in all,sunset financial paid at least for the purchase of a home to which neither sunset financial nor homa ever obtained legal title.the home was then sold and the proceeds went to companies with which pollock had entered into an employment agreement.none of the benefit accrued to homa or to banc caribe.
caribbean ventures sold its stock interest in banc caribe through two transactions,one with witherspoon financial in july and the other with aristocrat trust in december.witherspoon financial paid for a interest in banc caribe.although jones went to great lengths to hide his benefit from the sale,he kept the from that first sale for himself by diverting it through a shell corporation,morgan global capital created for that purpose.aristocrat trust paid for the remaining interest in banc caribe.after the sale of banc caribe was complete,another was diverted through morgan global capital for jones.the total consideration for the sale of banc caribe was.
pollock benefit from the sale remained in caribbean ventures.pollock was the sole employee of caribbean ventures.his employment commenced in january or february of and continued through the summer of.he later sued caribbean ventures for,the value of his employment contract with that company.pollock also sued banc caribe for the value of his employment contract with it and for,the value of an airplane lease on which banc caribe had defaulted additionally,pollock received more than in loans from caribbean ventures for the purchase of his home and other items,which he never repaid.caribbean ventures also distributed to pollock,jones and shillingford for the purchase and improvement of land in dominica.
these transactions reinvested the proceeds of homa criminal enterprises into shell entities.the end result was that pollock and jones ended up with a significant amount of money from the ponzi scheme proceeds by means of leases,loans and employment contracts that were nothing more than window dressing.
on may,at the request of the receiver,the district court entered an order to show cause why pollock and jones should not be held in contempt for their actions taken in violation of the freeze order.on june,the court froze bank caribe assets with a preliminary injunction against any transfers.on march,it issued an opinion and order in which it determined that it had jurisdiction over the bank,pollock and jones.this show cause order was later amended on march.
between february and,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the amended rule to show cause as to why pollock and jones should not be held in contempt for violating the freeze orders.on august,the court found pollock and jones in civil contempt and ordered that they jointly and severally disgorge approximately,plus prejudgment interest and costs.the court further ordered pollock and jones to appear personally before the court on august,and to provide the court with a specific plan and timetable for the payment of the money.the court specified that willful failure to comply with the order would result in the issuance of body attachment orders.
in that order,the district court found by clear and convincing evidence that pollock and jones,by their direct and indirect actions,had violated the freeze orders and engaged in three contemptuous acts.first,they had transferred from banc caribe paine webber account to the alpha credit bank in athens,greece.second,pollock and jones had cancelled homa notes and ownership in banc caribe,then misappropriated the funds from the sale of banc caribe for their own use.finally,they had in homa sunset financial account at banc caribe.the district court ordered pollock and jones to return to the receiver the funds lost in the second two transfers.specifically,the court ordered pollock and jones to disgorge the million from the sale of homa interest in banc caribe and the they had setoff from homa sunset financial account.the money from the first transfer to alpha credit was recovered by the receiver from another source.
the district court found that banc caribe and the entities did not maintain any formality or distinction between the assets that belonged to one or the other because the bank was a mere pretense.the court found banc caribe to be only a convenient structure within which to hold ponzi scheme money for the benefit of homa,pollock and jones therefore,the court determined that pollock and jones had violated the freeze orders by acting in concert with an enjoined person to dissipate protected assets,even if neither homa nor a entity had direct signatory authority over the accounts that transferred funds.
finally,the district court determined that,even assuming the existence of a legitimate banking relationship between sunset financial and banc caribe,the money in banc caribe paine webber account was an asset of sunset financial,and therefore directly was subject to the freeze order.jones admitted that the million transferred from the paine webber account was being held by banc caribe for the benefit of sunset financial.pollock and jones were aware of these facts,and that sunset financial funds were subject to a freeze order,when they transferred of that money from the paine webber investment account to alpha credit bank in athens,greece.
on august,jones appeared as ordered by the court,but he did not offer a plan to purge his contempt.jones therefore was confined to the bureau of prisons to encourage his compliance with the award.he was released on october,pursuant to an agreed order.as of march,jones had paid to the receiver.
on august,pollock timely filed his notice of appeal of the finding of contempt.pollock did not appear at the august hearing,and the district court issued a body attachment order against him.on september,the district court renewed the body attachment order against pollock,again directing the united states marshal to arrest him and bring him before the court.
on october,the receiver began to pursue pollock assets.the court had learned from jones that pollock had used his portion of the proceeds from the sale of banc caribe to purchase a home in lucia and three luxury yachts.the yachts were traced to,a delaware corporation that had been incorporated in and that was owned exclusively by pollock.the receiver filed a motion for a temporary restraining order against and sought to be appointed temporary receiver of in order to liquidate its assets.
on october,appeared through counsel and admitted that pollock was part owner of but contended that kelly pollock,pollock wife,was the controlling shareholder.agreed to produce kelly pollock for a deposition on october and further agreed that it would attempt to produce pollock.on october,however,sought permission to conduct the deposition from lucia,rather than in chicago.the court denied the request,and refused to produce any witnesses for deposition.in response,the receiver moved for sanctions against on october.the district court denied motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on november.
on november,the court authorized the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum to pollock and kelly pollock so that the receiver could explore their interests in and the company source of funding.the information was necessary to determine the receiver motion,which alleged that assets were subject to seizure to satisfy the contempt judgment against pollock.the court specifically notified,pollock and kelly pollock that failure to comply with the court order could result in the court defaulting.the subpoenas issued on november,and depositions for pollock and kelly pollock were scheduled for november.process was effectuated by fax and mail,and a process server attempted personal service at the pollock home on november,and.
failed to produce any witness,and neither of the pollocks appeared for deposition.the court determined that the pollocks depositions were essential to the preparation of the receiver case because the pollocks were the only persons with access to and control over corporate records.on december,the receiver moved for an order of default against,a turnover of assets,injunctive relief and for his appointment as receiver.
on march,the district court determined that it had no lesser means of curing the pollocks willful refusal to comply with the court orders than by defaulting.it did so,and took as confessed the allegations in the receiver motion for the turnover of assets.the court ordered to turn over all of its assets to the receiver.
timely filed its notice of appeal on march.on march,appeal was consolidated with the appeals of jones and pollock.
discussiona.
we review de novo questions of in personam jurisdiction.cent.states,se.and sw.areas pension fund phencorp reins,cir.the district court took the view that it had personal jurisdiction over jones and pollock because,although they were nonparties who reside outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states,they were american citizens who knowingly had violated the court freeze order and actively aid ed and abet ted a party in violating that order.waffenschmidt mackay,cir.the district court was correct.
in waffenschmidt,our colleagues of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit articulated succinctly the basic principles of law that must govern our assessment 
nonparties who reside outside the territorial jurisdiction of a district court may be subject to that court jurisdiction if,with actual notice of the court order,they actively aid and abet a party in violating that order.this is so despite the absence of other contacts with the forum.
id.this summary embodies several points of independent importance.we shall examine each briefly.
first,a court possesses the independent authority to enforce its own injunctive decrees.id.at.in this respect,rule d,which governs the contents and scope of injunctions,must be regarded as a codification rather than a limitation on a federal court inherent power to protect its ability to render a binding judgment.berry midtown serv,cir.
second,the injunctive mandate of a federal court runs nationwide,and the issuing court has the authority to deal with defiance of its order regardless of where that defiance occurs.waffenschmidt,at.indeed,the court whose order was defied must enforce the injunction through the contempt power because contempt is,in essence,an affront to the court that issues the order.id.as the supreme court put it in in re debs 
t he power of a court to make an order carries with it the equal power to punish for a disobedience of that order,and the inquiry as to the question of disobedience has been,from time immemorial,the special function of the court.and this is no technical rule.in order that a court may compel obedience to its orders,it must have the right to inquire whether there has been any disobedience thereof.to submit the question of disobedience to another tribunal,be it a jury or another court,would operate to deprive the proceeding of half its efficiency e very court,at least of the superior kind,in which great confidence is placed,must be the sole judge,in the last resort,of contempts arising therein.
abrogated in the criminal contempt context as recognized by united states dixon,d.
third,an injunction binds not only the parties to the injunction but also nonparties who act with the named party.commenting on rule d,the supreme court has noted that the rule 
is derived from the commonlaw doctrine that a decree of injunction not only binds the parties defendant but also those identified with them in interest,in privity with them,represented by them or subject to their control.in essence defendants may not nullify a decree by carrying out prohibited acts through aiders and abettors,although they were not parties to the original proceeding.
regal knitwear nlrb.in stotler able,cir,we specifically noted the vitality of this rule and its implementation through rule.indeed,if courts did not have the power to punish those who cooperate with those named in an injunction,the named parties could easily thwart the injunction by operating through others.
in stotler,we held that ordinarily a court may find a nonparty in contempt if that person has actual knowledge of the court order and either abets the party named in the court order or is legally identified with him.at addition in original.there,the district court declined to hold the nonparty in contempt because it dismissed the case without specifying any course of action to be undertaken by any person.id.even so,the court indicated that where obedience to an order may be lawfully enforced against a person who is not a party,that person is liable to the same process for enforcing obedience to the order as if a party.id.
applying the rule in stotler here,a person who knowingly circumvents a freeze order is subject to a show cause order and contempt and thereby submits to the jurisdiction of the court for contempt proceedings,as held in waffenschmidt.at.nonparties who reside outside the territorial jurisdiction of a district court may be subject to that court jurisdiction if,with actual notice of the court order,they actively aid and abet a party in violating that order.this is so despite the absence of other contacts with the forum.id.jurisdiction over persons who knowingly violate a court injunctive order,even those without any other contact with the forum,is necessary to the proper enforcement and supervision of a court injunctive authority and offends no precept of due process.id.at.
this rule is simply an application of two basic principles that govern the application of in personam jurisdiction in the united states.it has been that,when an individual undertakes activity designed to have a purpose and effect in the forum,the forum may exercise personal jurisdiction over that person with respect to those activities.see calder jones,d world wide volkswagen woodson,d int l shoe washington.see also burger king rudzewicz,d.see generally restatement of foreign relations law restatement second of conflicts of law.there can be no doubt that jones and pollock undertook activities outside the united states that were designed to have the purpose and effect within the united states of frustrating the district court freeze order.more important,as citizens of the united states,jones and pollock were required,once they had adequate notice,to obey the order of a united states court directed at them and their activities.see blackmer united states.
the district court determined that jones and pollock had acted in concert with homa,the defendant in the underlying action.it further determined that these individuals had actual knowledge of the court order.these findings are supported by the record.waffenschmidt,at.indeed,contrary to the defendants assertion,this is not a case in which the district court relied on sparse background information.rather,the district court drew its conclusions from extensive hearings.it determined that jones and pollock had been contumacious and untruthful.those findings are supported by the record.
pollock and jones knowingly acted in concert with homa to violate the court order.therefore,they subjected themselves to a show cause order and the subsequent contempt proceedings.see.the district court properly determined that it had personal jurisdiction over pollock and jones 
having determined that the district court correctly held that it had in personam jurisdiction over pollock and jones,we next address whether the district court correctly determined that the receiver had proved contempt by clear and convincing evidence.
we review the district court civil contempt order for abuse of discretion.feltner title search,cir.the receiver had the burden of showing contempt by clear and convincing evidence.united states dowell,cir.
the transfer of funds from america to greece 
the record supports the district court finding that jones and pollock knew of the freeze order before transferring funds from banc caribe account at paine webber to a correspondent account in alpha credit bank in athens,greece.jones and pollock do not dispute that they had some awareness of the freeze order before the transfer in question because they had been unable to transfer banc caribe funds from another source,dain rauscher.pollock had spoken with the legal department there about the trouble with banc caribe account.he admitted that he had learned about the freeze order from this conversation with dain rauscher.additionally,greg gibbs of dain rauscher legal department also faxed the freeze order to pollock.banc caribe transfer to alpha credit did not go through until several days after pollock and jones admit that they had received the freeze order by fax.that interval would have provided them with time to stop the transfer,if,as they contend,they had authorized the transfer before learning of the freeze order.
jones and pollock characterize the transaction as a mere transfer of bank funds from one banc caribe account to another.they admit,however,there was no reason for the transfer other than to avoid the freeze order.jones further admits that he did not cancel the transfer because he did not wish to stop it and because he made a conscious determination that he believed the freeze order was ambiguous.
pollock and jones also contend that the funds transferred from paine webber to alpha credit were not subject to the freeze order because the funds belonged to banc caribe,not one of the defendants.the district court properly determined,however,that banc caribe did not maintain any formalities between homa money and other assets.therefore,even if homa did not have signatory authority over the account from which the funds were transferred,homa controlled the funds with the intent to use the bank to launder his ponzi scheme proceeds.as described above,moreover,the money in the paine webber account was being held by banc caribe for the benefit of the sunset financial account.
the record establishes this knowing transfer of funds belonging to sunset financial,a defendant in the sec case.the district court reasonably found pollock and jones in contempt for this transfer 
the cancellation of homa interest in banc caribe 
the record also amply supports the district court findings that jones and pollock knew of the freeze order before they cancelled homa interest in banc caribe.the district court correctly determined that homa rights under whatever agreement he held with banc caribe were an asset.even if the value of that interest might have been in dispute,the interests of homa in banc caribe were specifically within the terms of the freeze order,and jones and pollock knowingly dissipated,transferred or concealed those assets after receipt of the freeze order.the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the shares were an asset of value belonging to homa at the time that the appellants cancelled the notes.
the of funds from the sunset financial account 
finally,the record supports the district court determination that pollock and jones violated the freeze orders by setting off,for their own benefit,from homa sunset financial account.shortly after cancelling homa interest in banc caribe,pollock closed homa sunset financial account.before closing the account,however,he invoked the bank alleged right to against the account by withdrawing on october,and,and on october.
pollock admitted that he did not contact anyone at the sec or the district court before removing the funds from the sunset financial account.pollock and jones also admit that the removal of from homa account occurred after actual notice of the freeze orders and involved money that,without dispute,came from an account over which homa had signatory authority.pollock and jones subsequently converted that portion of sunset financial assets to their own use.
this knowing against monies in an account over which homa had signatory authority is established in the record.the freeze orders enjoined the defendants in the sec action and those people acting in concert with them from disposing of the funds in any manner,directly or indirectly.the district court was on solid ground in finding pollock and jones in contempt for this.
additionally,the record does not support pollock assertion that the freeze orders violated dominican law.the district court found,and we agree,that the record does not establish that any law of dominica prohibited banc caribe,pollock or jones from complying with the freeze order.pollock and jones suggest generally that banc caribe needed to maintain liquidity to protect its investors and patrons.they do not,however,point to any particular amount of liquidity that the bank was required to maintain,and neither does the record show that the bank lacked any necessary liquidity at any point.
moreover,the district court freeze order simply required that pollock and jones not move from the bank any funds associated with homa or.two of their contumacious acts,the cancellation of homa interest in banc caribe and the of homa funds in the sunset financial account,violated those freeze orders by removing funds from banc caribe for their own benefit.compliance with the court orders would have resulted in pollock and jones leaving the funds in banc caribe,which,in contrast to their actions,presumably would have improved the liquidity of the bank.
we now turn to whether the district court erred in defaulting and in ordering the turnover of its assets.first argues that,because it is not a party,a rule sanction of default judgment is inappropriate.we can not accept this argument.see textile banking rentschler,cir.it is clear that,through its officers,directors and shareholders,intentionally and willfully refused to comply with the district court discovery orders.
the court properly found that,without compliance with its deposition subpoenas,the receiver was denied the ability to conduct crucial discovery that went to the heart of the receiver petition for appointment as receiver of.the record also supports the district court determination that pollock and pollock are the only persons with complete knowledge of the crucial facts concerning the ownership and control of and the only persons with possession and control of the corporate records of.this information was absolutely essential to the preparation of the receiver case.moreover,the assertions in the receiver amended verified motion and the documents submitted by the receiver corroborated the district court determination that the assets of are owned by,and in the possession and control of,pollock as the alter ego of.
therefore,the district court did not err when it determined that no lesser sanction than default would cure failure to comply with the district court discovery orders.neither did the court err when it took as admitted by the allegations in the amended motion to appoint the receiver of homa assets as receiver for.
we also believe that the district court did not err in its determination that it could exercise in personam jurisdiction over.the record supports the district court determination that was an alter ego of pollock.the record supports the court conclusion that the entity was essentially no more than a sham structure to contain the spoils of fraud and that pollock was not a bona fide controlling shareholder.
nor is there any question that the situation warranted the sanctions imposed by the district court.the only shareholders,and pollock,repeatedly refused to comply with the court orders to appear,to provide discovery and to give a deposition.the district court determination that the refusal was willful and that no lesser sanction would cure their failure to comply with discovery was solidly supported by the record.the court specifically found that the pollocks are the only persons with the information and materials crucial to the case against,and it reasonably concluded that no method other than in person depositions would suffice.it also specifically warned that repeated failure to comply with discovery requests would result in default if it did not produce its officers at the final deposition.in short,the district court,with record support,properly made the requisite findings before ordering a default judgment against.see in re thomas consol,cir holding that a finding of bad faith coupled with a warning about the sanction justified dismissal as a discovery sanction.the sanction of default is severe however,it certainly was not an abuse of discretion to employ it here.sun bd.of,cir.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
we have appellate jurisdiction over this judgment.a nonparty need not await final judgment in the underlying litigation before appealing a civil contempt finding.united states dowell,cir.monetary judgments against jones and pollock have been determined with the necessary particularity,even though the precise amount of prejudgment interest and attorneys fees has not been determined.see shapo engle,cir see also herzog contracting mcgowen,cir holding that the court had jurisdiction where interest sum,although not calculated,required only a mechanical process to determine.here,pollock and jones are both nonparties.the district court found pollock and jones in contempt and ordered them,jointly and severally,to pay to the receiver plus prejudgment interest.pollock and jones were not held jointly and severally liable with those defendants whose underlying action is not yet prejudgment interest is sufficiently determined to permit this appeal.with regard to of the judgment,the amount received by jones and pollock for the sale of banc caribe,the district court determined that interest began accruing on december.the interest on the remaining,the amount pollock and jones transferred from homa sunset holdings account at banc caribe,began to accrue on october,the date of the transfer.the court also noted that the receiver claimed in attorneys fees and costs,and it ordered the parties to follow the procedures set forth in the local rules for the collection of the claimed fees.the district judge finished with the case,and we have jurisdiction.chase manhattan mortgage moore,cir.
we also have appellate jurisdiction over appeal with respect to this entity,the district court order was final under.see matos richard nellis,cir see also philips med.int l,bruetman,cir.on august,the district court found pollock in contempt of court.it ordered him and jones,jointly and severally,to disgorge in excess of million in funds that they misappropriated in violation of the court freeze orders.the court also enjoined them from dissipating any of their assets.additionally,the district court issued a temporary restraining order against,an order appointing the receiver as temporary receiver for the corporation,and an order to show cause.the district court issued these orders to prevent pollock from dissipating his assets he held in then refused to comply with the district court discovery orders.the district court considered refusal to comply with the court orders and noted that pollock was the only person authorized to transfer ownership and control of the assets.the district court also noted that pollock purposely had avoided the court enforcement powers in the past.finding that no sanction except default would cure intentional failure to comply with the court discovery orders,the district court declared in default and took the receiver allegations as confessed.the district court specifically took as admitted that pollock was the only shareholder of.the district court then concluded by appointing the receiver of homa assets as the receiver of,and by ordering to turn over its assets to the receiver to satisfy the judgment against have jurisdiction to review the district court discovery sanction that defaulted.see patterson ex rel.patterson coca cola bottling.cairo sikeston,cir see also philips,at.we also have jurisdiction to review the turnover of assets to the receiver.see matos,at holding that,after peacock,a court ancillary jurisdiction is greater in actions than in independe
