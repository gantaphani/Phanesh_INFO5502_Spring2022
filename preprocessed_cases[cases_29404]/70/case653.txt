characterized by the trial court as litigation in which m oney does not appear to be an object to the parties and counsel,this case calls on us to consider the propriety of a discovery referee order imposing in discovery sanctions against defendants alieu conteh conteh,odessa capital,dominique financial,ooa one,llc,and ooa two,llc collectively,defendants,for failure to comply with a prior discovery order.defendants contend the referee,stipulated to by the parties to rule on all discovery related matters,erred in imposing monetary sanctions due to both procedural and substantive defects.among other things,they assert that defendants substantial compliance with the prior discovery order,combined with conteh expressed willingness to sit for an additional deposition and produce additional documents,precluded the levying of any sanctions.they also claim the amount of sanctions is unjustified.
in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that the referee order,filed with the trial court,is appealable.the language of the reference,expressly made under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a and the actions of the parties,the referee and the court,indicate that the reference was a general reference,making the referee order appealable once filed with the court.
in the unpublished portion,we address the merits of defendants appeal and reject their challenges to the imposition and amount of monetary sanctions.defendants conceded below that they failed to comply with the prior discovery order,and the referee did not abuse her discretion under the circumstances either in determining monetary sanctions were appropriate despite conteh promises about his future actions,or in calculating the amount of appropriate sanctions.
facts and procedural background 
african wireless,african wireless is a delaware corporation owned by a handful of shareholders.conteh and his closely held business entity,dominique financial,own approximately percent of african wireless shares.in addition to being a shareholder,conteh is african wireless ceo and chairman of its board of directors.he has the power to nominate three of the five members of the african wireless board.plaintiffs james lindsey,as trustee of the lindsey family trust,william buck johns,wymont services,and marc van antro collectively,the minority shareholders each hold between a one and percent interest in african wireless,and all but one acts as,or has a representative who acts as,a director of african wireless.
african wireless principal place of business is designated as the city of irvine,but the corporation has no operations,no sales and no employees.its purpose is to act as a holding company,with its principal asset being a percent interest in congolese wireless network sprl congolese wireless.congolese wireless is a business entity organized under the laws of the democratic republic of congo the drc.its principal place of business is in kinshasa,drc,and all of its operations take place in the drc.beginning in,conteh served as manager of congolese wireless.with assistance from conteh and a few politically connected and powerful citizens in the drc,congolese wireless embarked on a joint venture with another company,vodacom international.they created a new entity known as vodacom congo for the purpose of owning and operating a wireless telephone network in the drc.
in late,a congolese criminal tribunal allegedly convicted conteh of forgery,sentencing him to one year in jail.a warrant was supposedly issued for his immediate arrest following the rejection of all appeals in the case.conteh chose to flee the country to avoid incarceration.less than two years later,a congolese commercial tribunal allegedly ruled against conteh in a business lawsuit due to conteh criminal forgery conviction.that alleged ruling prohibited conteh from performing any acts in the name of,and on behalf of,congolese wireless,and representing congolese wireless within any of the management and administrative bodies of vodacom congo.
in august,the minority shareholders filed this shareholder derivative action on behalf of african wireless and against conteh,as an individual,and various of his alleged investment entities that purportedly have ties to congolese wireless and african wireless.the operative complaint alleges that over the course of nearly a decade,conteh took various actions and engaged in transactions that were detrimental to african wireless interests and that usurped opportunities belonging to it.the causes of action include breach of fiduciary duty,unjust enrichment,accounting and conversion,and among the relief sought is monetary damages,prejudgment interest,injunctive relief,declaratory relief and a constructive trust.
the minority shareholders sought a temporary restraining order tro and a preliminary injunction to remove conteh from his african wireless director position and prohibit him from voting his shares in the corporation.the trial court denied the tro request,but scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing.in preparation for the hearing,the parties initiated expedited discovery by way of interrogatories,deposition notices,and requests for admissions and production of documents.at this point,whatever was not already sour between the parties quickly turned such.the minority shareholders accused conteh,as an individual and as the representative of the business entity defendants,of failing to produce a single document,refusing to confirm a deposition date and appear for a deposition,and unreasonably objecting to all discovery.in turn,defendants accused all or some of the minority shareholders of refusing to produce for deposition a witness,jonathan sandler sandler,producing a shell person most knowledgeable pmk for deposition,and failing to respond to interrogatories and document production requests.
after a variety of back and forth between the parties counsel,the parties remained unable to agree on deposition schedules and locations,and each believed the other was continuing to fail to provide meaningful discovery responses.at the preliminary injunction hearing,the trial court briefly addressed discovery matters raised in the parties preliminary injunction papers,expressing disappointment in the utter inability of counsel to effectively meet and confer.believing a discovery referee to be necessary,the court directed counsel to meet and confer to select one,but left the parties to work out the details.
thereafter,the parties agreed upon a discovery referee and related details.they stipulated that the referee would have broad powers,including the authority to set the date,time,and place for any hearings determined by the discovery referee to be necessary,to preside over hearings,to take evidence if the referee so determines,rule on discovery objections,discovery motions,and other requests made during the course of the hearing.the reference order drafted by the parties,and issued by the trial court,indicated it was made pursuant to section,subdivision a,and ordered that the parties then pending discovery motions were to be heard and decided by the referee.
in january,following a telephonic hearing and a review of the more than pages submitted in conjunction with the then pending motions to compel,the discovery referee issued a detailed ruling and order.the referee ordered conteh to attend a deposition in south africa on specified dates,and sandler to attend a deposition in the same location on the two days prior to the start of conteh deposition.the parties stipulated that conteh was the pmk for each of the business entity defendants,so his appearance would be both in his individual capacity and as pmk.as for documents,defendants were ordered to produce the documents listed in the deposition notices for conteh and the business entity defendants on or before february,a date days prior to conteh scheduled deposition at a time,place and manner agreed upon by counsel.defendants were also ordered to provide certain verifications and privilege logs.
defendants served their first document production and related responses on the agreed upon date.two days later,defendants counsel produced an additional batch of documents without a proof of service.
both sandler and conteh depositions took place in south africa as ordered by the discovery referee,with conteh lasting the full three days for which it was scheduled.during the first day of conteh deposition,conteh admitted that he did not produce certain requested documents even though he acknowledged their existence,and that he had not done a diligent search for all responsive documents in his possession and control.he stated that additional documents were likely in his office in south africa or in the drc,and that the latter could be sent by his staff in the drc.
two days after conteh deposition concluded,the minority shareholders sent a motion to the discovery referee requesting that discovery sanctions be levied against conteh and each of the business entity defendants for their alleged failure to comply with the portion of the referee january order concerning document production.they requested terminating,evidentiary,contempt and monetary sanctions.defendants opposed the sanctions motion.
following a hearing,and taking into consideration all of the parties arguments and evidence,the referee issued a detailed ruling,finding that conteh had violated the january order in multiple ways.based on her factual findings,the referee concluded that monetary sanctions were warranted,but other sanctions were not.she found the more than requested by the minority shareholders to be excessive,and instead imposed in sanctions.
the referee sanctions order was filed with the trial court on may.defendants timely appealed,limiting their appeal to the monetary sanctions aspect of the order.
discussiona.determining the nature of the reference 
an appeal of an order to pay monetary sanctions in an amount over is an appealable order over which we have jurisdiction,subd.a rail transport employees union pacific motor freight th.our review of the record raised a concern about whether the discovery referee ruling from which defendants appeal is a qualifying order given that the trial court filed the ruling,but took no further action with respect to it.at our request,the parties provided additional briefing concerning the nature of the reference and the resulting implications on appealability we conclude,based on the language of the reference and the actions of the parties,the referee and the court,that the reference was a general reference,making the referee order directly appealable without further action from the court.
the parties agree that if the reference to the referee was a general reference,the referee sanctions ruling stands as one of the trial court and,thus,would be directly appealable,subd.a,the decision of the referee appointed pursuant to section may be excepted to and reviewed in like manner as if made by the court ellsworth ellsworth cal d,ellsworth.there is also agreement on the converse if it was a special reference,the ruling is not appealable because the court did not take action to independently review and adopt it,in whole or in part,subd.b aetna life ins.superior court d,aetna.the critical question is whether the reference is properly characterized as general or special.
the code of civil procedure provides for both general and special references.a general reference is an appointment to a referee made pursuant to section,subdivision a,giving the referee authority t o hear and determine any or all of the issues in an action or proceeding,whether of fact or of law,and to report a statement of decision.italics added see fredendall shrader,kajima engineering construction,pacific bell th,jovine fhp,th,ruisi thieriot th,ruisi.a special reference is an appointment to a referee made pursuant to section,subdivision b,or section,giving the referee authority to perform certain specified tasks and report a recommendation back to the trial court for independent consideration and further action by the court,subd.b ellsworth,supra,cal d at ruisi,supra,th at dynair electronics,video cable,d.although a special reference may be made with or without the consent of the parties,a general reference requires the parties prior consent so as to avoid an unlawful delegation of judicial power,holt kelly cal d,aetna,supra,d at.
to determine the nature of the reference,we look not only to the language of the order of reference,but also to any recitals in the referee ruling,the conduct of the parties and the subsequent actions of the trial court.see in re estate of hart cal d lewis grunberg cal.estate of bassi d,estate of bassi.
here,the reference order derived from a stipulation and request of the parties and was submitted by them to the trial court in proposed form.it expressly states that the referee appointment is made pursuant to california code of civil procedure section a and further specifies that the appointment is as to all discovery matters for purposes of this action.the reference authorizes the referee to,among other things,set any hearings determined by the referee to be necessary,preside over the hearings,and rule on discovery objections,discovery motions,and other requests made during the course of the hearing.and,within days after the completion of any hearing,the referee is required to submit a written decision to the parties and to the court,with findings and decisions thereon,including a decision for allocation of payment and any decision for the imposition of sanctions.
this language,and the explicit mention of section,subdivision a,is indicative of a consensual general reference.the referee was not merely empowered to determine and report facts,make a recommendation,and there is no provision for the trial court subsequent involvement in rulings made by the referee.see,subd.c compare dallman southern heater d,reference order authorizing referee to ascertain facts concerning existence and amount of damages for report back to court was special reference weavering schneider,reference authorizing referee to examine and report information to court so that court could consider the issue was special reference.rather,the parties with the court approval gave the referee the power to make findings and decisions and rule on all discovery matters,including requests for sanctions.see also hihn peck cal,reference order requiring referee to try the issues and report his findings thereon was general,not special,reference.
the general nature of the reference is underscored by the subsequent actions of the parties,the referee and the trial court.after the reference order was issued,the referee accepted further briefing and heard the parties motions to compel that had originally been filed with the court.in the resulting ruling,which ordered the south africa depositions of both conteh and sandler and the related document production,the referee stated at the outset that she was ordered to serve pursuant to ccp section a and that the parties had stipulated that she was vested with the authority to rule on discovery motions and depositions at the request of a party.thereafter,the parties acted as if the referee ruling had binding effect without any further action by the court.and,when the ruling was sent to the court,the court filed it and took no other action.a similar sequence of events occurred with respect to the sanctions motion and ruling from which this appeal stems.
because we conclude the reference was a general reference,the referee sanctions ruling,filed with the trial court,stand s as the decision of the court and we have jurisdiction over the appeal,subd.a see,subd.a rail transport,supra,th at.
motion to dismiss appeal 
next,we address the minority shareholders motion to dismiss the appeal,which was filed after briefing was complete.they assert dismissal is warranted for multiple reasons,each of which lacks merit.
the minority shareholders contend dismissal is proper under the disentitlement doctrine due to what they describe as defendants pattern and practice of engaging in willful defiance of trial court orders and improper obstructive tactics.the disentitlement doctrine is an equitable doctrine which recognizes an appellate court inherent power to dismiss the appeal of a party who has refused to obey legal court orders.blumberg minthorne th,blumberg macpherson macpherson cal d.it prevents a party from seeking assistance from the court while that party is in an attitude of contempt to legal orders and processes of the courts.in re marriage of hofer th.a formal finding of contempt is not required the same principle applies to wilful sic disobedience or obstructive tactics without such an adjudication.alioto fish alioto th.the doctrine has been applied in a wide range of situations,including where the appellant repeatedly refused to comply with discovery orders.blumberg,supra,th at see,in re marriage of hofer,supra,th.
to support their disentitlement doctrine argument,the minority shareholders cite a february statement of decision issued by the same discovery referee that granted the sanctions motion at issue in this appeal.the decision states that the defendants willfully failed to comply with multiple court orders concerning discovery and concludes with a determination that terminating sanctions were appropriate.
although we grant the minority shareholders unopposed motion for us to take judicial notice of the february decision we do nothing more than note its existence and the existence of the statements therein.kilroy,supra,th at.judicial notice of the truth of the content of trial court records generally is not appropriate either because the truth of the content is reasonably subject to dispute citation,or because the content is hearsay citations.columbia casualty,supra,d at.such is the case here,where,among other things,the defendants assert that facts relied on by the discovery referee were materially misrepresented by the minority shareholders,and an appeal concerning the grant of terminating sanctions and entry of default judgment is currently pending in this court 
because the february ruling is the sole evidence on which the minority shareholders rely to support their argument,there is a lack of evidence demonstrating the acute recalcitrance necessary to justify dismissal pursuant to the disentitlement doctrine.
we likewise reject the minority shareholders next contention that dismissal is warranted due to what they characterize as an irreconcilable conflict of interest had by the defendants former counsel.they claim that at the time this appeal was filed,defendants then counsel concurrently represented african wireless,a corporation that is a nominal defendant in this case,and conteh,an individual who is a corporate director of african wireless and who is accused of,inter alia,fraudulent mismanagement of the corporation.even if such was the case and such concurrent representation amounted to some type of conflict of interest,matters on which we express no opinion,the minority shareholders provide no legal authority for the proposition that dismissal would be appropriate.see cal.rules of court,rule a a party wanting to make a motion in a reviewing court must serve and file a written motion stating the grounds and the relief requested and identifying any documents on which the motion is based potrero neuvo land all persons claiming cal,burden is on party moving to dismiss appeal to show that grounds for dismissal of the appeal exist.
lastly,contrary to the minority shareholders assertions,discovery sanction orders in excess of are directly appealable pursuant to section,subdivision a,subd.a from an order directing payment of monetary sanctions by a party or an attorney for a party if the amount exceeds five thousand dollars tucker pacific bell mobile services th,sinaiko healthcare consulting,pacific healthcare consultants th,sinaiko.the cases they cite in support of the contrary were superseded on this point by a legislative amendment to section.rail transport,supra,th at.
monetary sanctions 
turning to the merits of the appeal,defendants argue that the referee unwarrantedly imposed monetary sanctions due to both procedural defects and substantive errors.we generally review the imposition of a discovery sanction,and the amount imposed,for abuse of discretion.reedy bussell th,reedy the court discretion to impose discovery sanctions is broad,subject to reversal only for manifest abuse exceeding the bounds of reason parker wolters kluwer united states,th.we review the referee factual findings under a substantial evidence standard of review in re marriage of feldman th,and we review de novo certain procedural aspects,such as whether adequate notice of the sanctions motion was provided see central valley general hospital smith th,questions of law are reviewed de novo.
additional facts relevant to sanctions award 
to aid in our discussion of defendants assertions,we provide some additional detail concerning the parties discovery disputes and the referee orders.
prior to a referee being appointed,the minority shareholders noticed conteh deposition for a date in early september,with the deposition to take place where conteh claimed to reside south africa.conteh,through his counsel,objected to both the date and location of the deposition.he indicated that paris,france,where his counsel had an office,would be a more suitable place for the deposition as it would save considerable travel time and expense for both parties.the minority shareholders counsel rejected such a location,stating that they had already undertaken great expense to accommodate the taking of conteh deposition near his home in south africa.following contentious exchanges between the parties respective counsels,conteh counsel indicated agreement to south africa as the location,but proposed a date that fell not long before the date scheduled for the preliminary injunction hearing.the minority shareholders counsel insisted on the originally noticed deposition date,a date on which conteh had previously indicated he was not available.additional back and forth between the parties counsel ensued,with south africa,paris and london each mentioned as a potential location for conteh deposition,but no agreement was reached.
after the trial court appointed the referee pursuant to the parties stipulation,the referee considered the then pending motions to compel,which were primarily focused on mandating the appearance of conteh and sandler at depositions and requiring the production of documents requested in prior deposition notices.in the resulting january order,the referee detailed at length and with great specificity what each party was being ordered to do.because the parties had both expressed concern that the other would not ultimately produce its respective deponent,the referee cautioned that if either sandler or conteh did not appear for his deposition,there would be serious and appropriate sanctions,which the parties agreed would at a minimum include the striking of their pleadings.
defendants first production of documents,consisting of just under pages,was served via and overnight mail and accompanied by verifications and a proof of service.their second production of documents,consisting of approximately pages,lacked a proof of service and was delivered via an which contained an electronic link to a file transfer protocol ftp site from which copies could be downloaded.
in the minority shareholders motion for sanctions that followed conteh south africa deposition,they alleged that conteh made little to no effort to collect responsive documents and that defendants failed to produce the requested bank statements,source financial documentation,emails,and minutes of corporate meetings and correspondence.although they requested that defendants be ordered to pay the expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in connection with their travel to johannesburg,south africa to take the depositions in the amount to be determined per the declaration of counsel,they did not specify an amount.
defendants opposed the sanctions motion on multiple grounds.first,they argued that conteh,as an individual and on behalf of the entities,had obeyed the referee order in good faith by producing two batches of responsive documents,which they claimed included financial documents,emails,corporate meeting minutes,and correspondence.second,they argued that conteh could not produce the congolese wireless documents desired by the minority shareholders because they were not within his possession,custody,or control.third,they asserted sanctions were unnecessary because conteh had already offered to appear in los angeles for a second deposition and produce additional documents at that time.fourth,defendants argued they should not have to pay the minority shareholders travel expenses for conteh south africa deposition because the minority shareholders counsel would have travelled there anyway for sandler deposition,and the minority shareholders had unreasonably rejected defendants offers to have conteh deposition take place in a location that would have reduced costs,california,paris,london.
in reply,the minority shareholders admitted to receiving both sets of documents from defendants,but emphasized that the second set was provided two days after the deadline specified by the referee order the second set failed to include a proof of service,which they argued meant it was not a valid production all responsive documents had not been produced,including certain financial records conteh was not truthful about having diligently searched for responsive documents and conteh offer to sit for an additional deposition and produce additional documents was insufficient to avoid the imposition of sanctions for his past conduct.the minority shareholders reiterated their request to be reimbursed for certain fees and costs,this time including not only the full cost of the south africa deposition,airfare,hotel,court reporter costs and attorney time,but also attorney fees related to the sanctions motion.no specific dollar amounts were listed they indicated that proper sworn declarations and proof of expenditures would be submitted if the referee were to grant their request.
less than hours before the telephonic hearing concerning the sanctions,and in response to a tentative ruling provided by the referee,the minority shareholders counsel submitted a supplemental declaration.an attachment to the declaration listed the costs and fees allegedly incurred by the minority shareholders in connection with conteh south africa deposition and attorney fees related to the sanctions motion for the former and for the latter,for a total of.
because the discovery referee tentative ruling was to deny the requests for nonmonetary sanctions and the minority shareholders counsel submitted on that tentative,defendants counsel focused his arguments during the hearing on the issue of monetary sanctions.in addition to opposing any award on a variety of both procedural and substantive grounds,defendants counsel objected to the hour costs and fees declaration.the referee took the matter under submission.
the ensuing detailed ruling by the referee found that conteh appeared for the ordered deposition in south africa,produced responsive documents on february,and on february,made a belated supplemental production of documents,together with a privilege log,but failed to attach the requisite proof of service for the documents and never produced hard copies.the referee also found that conteh signed an affidavit under oath attesting to a diligent search for the documents responsive to the deposition notice,but conceded during his deposition that he neither performed a diligent search nor produced all responsive documents under his control.
it was based on these factual findings that the referee concluded monetary sanctions were warranted.the amount she deemed reasonable included half the costs of conteh south africa deposition airfare,hotel and court reporter,attorney fees for a portion of the attorney time spent on the deposition,and a portion of the attorneys fees and costs related to the sanctions motion.although defense counsel did not request an opportunity to respond to the minority shareholders costs and fees declaration,the referee authorized defendants to file a written opposition within seven days to address the amount of monetary sanctions.if they did so,the referee would reconsider the entire amount of the sanction.
in addition to imposing monetary sanctions,the referee ordered conteh to take certain actions.first,he was reordered to produce the documents he was supposed to produce under the january order,and to execute a sworn affidavit that he diligently searched for and produced all responsive documents,except for privileged documents which were to be included in a privilege log.to resolve a dispute over certain categories of documents,the order mandated that three specified categories of documents be part of the forthcoming production.second,the referee ordered conteh to provide the minority shareholders counsel with a thumb drive of electronic copies of the documents produced on february,along with a properly executed proof of serviced.third,consistent with his voluntary offer,conteh was ordered to appear for an additional deposition in los angeles.the defendants filed a timely written opposition,along with declarations and exhibits.however,instead of limiting their arguments to the amounts specified in opposing counsel declaration,their opposition largely rehashed their belief as to why monetary sanctions were not warranted in the first instance arguments already considered and rejected by the referee.
imposition of sanctions 
defendants contend that the imposition of monetary sanctions in any amount was error because statutory procedural requirements were not followed sanctions were unnecessary given that conteh agreed to an additional deposition in los angeles and to produce additional documents conteh could not be legally obligated to produce some of the documents at issue because they were not under his control and conteh substantially complied with the january order.we reject each of these contentions.
defendants first argue that the minority shareholders failed to meet and confer prior to requesting sanctions.but,there is no meet and confer requirement for a sanctions request based on misuse of discovery or based on a party violation of an order concerning production of documents,subd.k sinaiko,supra,at.defendants improperly conflate the requirements for a motion to compel attendance at a deposition a related production of documents,subd.b,subd.b with those applicable to a sanctions motion for noncompliance with a trial court discovery order.it was the latter,not the former that was the basis of the minority shareholders sanctions request.
their next argument,that the referee lacked authority to award sanctions pursuant to sections and because the minority shareholders only requested relief under section,is likewise without merit.to begin,defendants provide no authority for the proposition that citation to a particular statutory section in the notice of motion or motion is a mandatory prerequisite to a discovery sanction award.further,even if such a requirement existed,and even if we assumed defendants preserved the issue by raising it below,which they did not,their assertion ignores the interplay of the discovery statutes.
section authorizes a trial court to impose sanctions for conduct that amounts to a misuse of the discovery process,but it is not.the types of sanctions available for a particular misuse are a function of authorizations set forth in the statute s applicable to each discovery method or any another discovery statute.to the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.for example,section,subdivision h,provides,if a party or deponent fails to obey an order compelling attendance,testimony,and production,the court may make those orders that are just,including the imposition of an issue sanction,an evidence sanction,or a terminating sanction it further authorizes the court to impose a monetary sanction either in lieu of,or in addition to,the other sanctions mentioned.ibid.section,subdivision k,makes a nearly identical authorization for situations in which a deponent fails to obey an order requiring him or her to produce documents answer certain questions.here,the minority shareholders request clearly indicated they were seeking sanctions for the defendants failure to comply with the o rder for d iscovery of j
