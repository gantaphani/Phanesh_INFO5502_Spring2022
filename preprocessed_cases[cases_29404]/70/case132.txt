in this appeal,the appellant law firm,moskowitz,passman edelman mpe or the firm,argues that its managing partner draws that is,advances on profit distributions to which he was entitled pursuant to the firm partnership not salary or wages under e of the internal revenue code.mpe proffers this contention in defense of its failure to comply with two administrative levies served on it by the internal revenue service the irs or the government,relating to the personal income tax liability of the firm managing partner.
the district court rejected this contention and imposed a statutory fine for the firm with the levies.we,too,are unpersuaded by the firm bold attempt to evade the levies.therefore,we affirm and hold that the e levy was sufficient to reach the partner draws from mpe profits.
background 
the facts are undisputed and straightforward.the levies at issue relate to the personal income tax liability of sheldon edelman,the managing partner of mpe,which is a law firm organized as a partnership under new york law.pursuant to mpe oral partnership agreement,edelman was entitled to of the firm profits and jeffrey motelson,the firm other partner,was entitled to.edelman dep.edelman handled the checkbook for the firm,and wrote mpe checks to himself and to motelson on an basis.id.he characterized these payments as draw s or advances taken against whatever the firm profits were going to be at the end of the year.id.
beginning in,the irs sought to collect edelman unpaid taxes from by serving administrative levies on mpe first,on march,the irs served mpe with a form c notice of levy on wages,salary,and other income the salary levy.the salary levy listed edelman as the relevant taxpayer and indicated that he owed in unpaid taxes,penalties,and interest for the years.it also stated 
this levy requires you mpe to turn over to us edelman wages and salary that have been earned but not paid yet,as well as wages and salary earned in the future until this levy is released,and edelman other income that you have now or for which you are obligated.
mpe did not turn over any funds in response to the salary levy.
on may,the irs sent the firm a form final demand letter relating to the salary levy.the letter stated that d emand is again made for the amount of,shown in the salary levy,or for any smaller sum you may have owed the taxpayer at the time the salary levy was served.the letter also warned that,if mpe did not comply with the demand within five days of its service,then the irs would consider it mpe final refusal and may then start proceedings under internal revenue code section.
when mpe did not respond to the demand letter,the irs sent the firm a second notice of levy on april,this time on form c the property levy.like the salary levy,the property levy related to edelman tax liability for the years.based on the lapse of time between the first and second levy,the notice indicated that edelman owed in back taxes,penalties,and interest.it directed mpe to turn over to the irs edelman property and rights to property such as money,credits,and bank deposits that you mpe have or which you are already obligated to pay edelman.mpe did not respond to the property levy,and the irs sent the firm a second final demand letter on june.this letter contained language substantially similar to that in the may,demand letter but called for the more recently calculated figure of.mpe did not respond to the second demand letter.
on may,the government commenced this action to enforce both levies pursuant to d.following discovery,the parties for summary judgment and the district court ruled in favor of the government.see united states moskowitz,passman edelman,civ,wl.it held that calling the payment a draw or an advance instead of salary is insufficient to except it from the levies ambit.id.at citing united states life ins,cir and united states has,civ,wl,at.the court reasoned that,k eeping in mind the spirit of the law,the fact that monies are paid out to the partners frequently weekly as advances on future income can not exempt the law firm from the statute by virtue of edelman partner status.id.the court also found that mpe had not demonstrated reasonable cause for its failure to comply with the levies,and assessed an additional statutory penalty pursuant to d.see wl,at.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the legal conclusions relied on by the district court to grant summary judgment,marine ins.lafarge,cir.mpe principal argument in this appeal is that the district court erred by holding that edelman partnership draws were salary or wages under e.we accept mpe invitation to resolve the appeal on this basis,and reject its lone contention for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the salary levy,served pursuant to e,was sufficient to reach edelman draws from mpe because the checks that he wrote to himself were periodic payments that compensated him for his services to the firm.therefore,we affirm.
federal tax liens and administrative levies by the irs 
when an individual such as edelman fails to pay his income taxes after a demand from the irs,a statutory lien in the amount of the deficiency arises on all property and rights to property,whether real or personal,belonging to such person.the lien remains in effect until the deficiency is either satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.id.as exemplified by edelman failure to pay his back taxes,however,a federal tax lien is not.united states bank of commerce.nevertheless,the irs is not without a sword to wield when a taxpayer fails to honor his or her income tax obligations.congress has armed the agency with at least two statutory mechanisms for collecting unpaid income taxes suits,see and administrative levies,see id.only the latter option is relevant here.
the administrative levy tool is a summary,process,a method of authorized by statute which provides the irs with a prompt and convenient method for satisfying delinquent tax claims.united states sullivan,cir.the power to levy was designed to enable the government promptly to secure its revenues while competing claims are resolved.united states ryals,f d,cir quoting united states ruff,cir.the procedure allows the government to collect on a tax lien by levying upon all property and rights to property of the deficient taxpayer,even if in the hands of third parties,whether real or personal,tangible or intangible.a,b.stronger language could hardly have been selected to reveal a purpose to assure the collection of taxes.glass city bank united states,see also drye united states.
an administrative levy typically extends only to property possessed and obligations existing at the time the levy is served.b.the property levy fit within this category.according to treasury regulations,obligations exist with respect to such a levy when the liability of the obligor is fixed and determinable although the right to receive payment thereof may be deferred until a later date.a.thus,subject to certain exceptions,e,h,a levy does not usually reach property acquired after the date on which it is served.see united states hemmen,cir.
one of the exceptions to this rule,which the irs relied on when it served the salary levy,is a continuing levy pursuant to e.section e was added to the tax code as part of the tax reform act of,stat,in order to alleviate the administrative burdens on the irs that arose out of requiring the agency to make successive levies in cases involving salaries and wages.meehan comm r.the statute provides that t he effect of a levy on salary or wages payable to or received by a taxpayer shall be continuous from the date such levy is first made until such levy is released.e.
b.the d action to enforce the administrative levies 
after mpe failed to respond to either of the irs final demand letters,the government commenced this action pursuant to d.in such an action,the defendant may be held personally liable in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights that it failed to surrender,up to the amount of the underlying tax deficiency.d.the court may also impose a penalty if it finds that the defendant ignored the levies without reasonable cause.id.d.
