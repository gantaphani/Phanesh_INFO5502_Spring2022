arnold itkin llp,a law firm,appeals from a judgment of the united district court for the southern district of new york sand,sanctioning arnold itkin for its conduct in opposing the arbitration of a dispute between its client,michael enmon,and appellee prospect capital corporation prospect arnold itkin challenges the determination that its conduct was sanctionable and the amount and form of the sanctions imposed.for the reasons that follow,we largely affirm the judgment of the district court,except that we remand in part to permit the district court to consider whether it should impose certain limits on its requirement that arnold itkin attorneys attach the sanctions order to all future applications for admission pro hac vice in the southern district of new york.
background 
the sanctions imposed on arnold itkin arose out of michael enmon attempts to obtain a subordinated loan from prospect to complete his acquisition of caprock pipe supply lp caprock lp,a company in the business of purchasing,refurbishing and selling pipes for use in connection with oil and natural gas wells.in april,enmon formed a company called caprock pipe supply,caprock,solely as a vehicle for borrowing the funds to purchase caprock lp.that same month,enmon,with the help of his robert fiser,signed a letter agreement and term sheet collectively,the letter agreement with prospect to obtain financing for the acquisition in the form of a subordinated loan for million.the letter agreement contained an arbitration provision that committed the parties to resolving all disputes arising thereunder through binding arbitration in new york city.the letter agreement also provided that prospect financing proposal was subject to actual delivery of the final deal documents.
in anticipation of the deal closing in may,prospect prepared several draft documents and went so far as to forward to its corporate counsel on the deal,vinson elkins llp,provisionally signed signature pages of a credit agreement the credit agreement identifying enmon company,caprock,as the counterparty.the signature pages were undated and unattached to a draft of the credit agreement.they were forwarded by email to place vinson elkins in a position to circulate an executed credit agreement as soon as one was finalized.indeed,the accompanying email message to vinson elkins stated attached are our signature pages.please check form.do not send out until you talk to me.for v e only.
in may,based on the results of its due diligence and enmon belated request for an additional million in financing,prospect decided not to finance enmon purchase of caprock lp.
the texas tro 
in september,fiser sued enmon in texas state court for unpaid legal fees in connection with fiser work on the failed prospect financing transaction.in contesting the lawsuit,enmon,at this point represented by jason itkin,a named partner of arnold itkin,filed claims against prospect,alleging common law fraud,statutory fraud under texas state law,and tortious interference with a contract between enmon and caprock lp.the claims were based on prospect decision not to consummate the financing proposed in the letter agreement and contemplated by the draft credit agreement.
relying on the arbitration clause contained in the letter agreement,prospect responded by initiating an arbitration proceeding in new york and filing a petition to compel arbitration in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the sdny action.on january,jason itkin told prospect that he intended to ask the texas state court for a temporary restraining order the texas tro staying the new york arbitration proceeding.in an email response the following day,prospect counsel advised itkin that she would seek a temporary restraining order in the southern district of new york the sdny tro that same day to enjoin the texas state court action.itkin ignored the email and applied for the texas tro.
arnold itkin application for the texas tro was signed by itkin under the name arnold itkin llp.it requested not only that the texas state court stay the arbitration proceeding,but that it issue a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction prohibiting prospect from taking any further action in new york state or federal courts until the texas court had ruled on the applicability of the arbitration provision.although the proposed order attached to the application disclosed that the prospect defendants are seeking a temporary restraining order in new york,the application failed to disclose that prospect had already filed a complaint in new york federal court.
both the district court and the texas state court granted their respective tros on january,the following day,instead of offering to withdraw the texas action,arnold itkin wrote a letter to both courts advising them of the dueling tros and suggesting that the courts dissolve both tros and allow the proceedings in both courts to continue.at a hearing several days later,prospect advised the texas state court that the competing new york case was in federal court and that the texas tro was unconstitutional under general atomic felter,d,because it sought to enjoin a federal court action.so informed,the texas state court promptly adjourned the hearing,effectively suspending its tro.
in february,the district court granted prospect petition to compel arbitration after concluding that enmon objections to arbitrability either strain ed the language of the letter agreement or were precluded by clear and controlling precedent in the second circuit.enmon timely appealed the district court judgment,but,in the meantime,arbitration was scheduled to start on july,
the rule b motion 
less than two weeks before the arbitration,arnold itkin filed a motion in the district court under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,on behalf of enmon and caprock as an intervenor,for relief from the order granting prospect motion to compel arbitration.the firm sought an order permitting caprock to pursue litigation in new york state court for breach of the draft credit agreement.it argued that the signature pages for that agreement constituted new ly uncovered evidence establishing that the draft credit agreement had been executed and that the arbitration provision in the letter agreement had been superseded.without revealing that caprock had recently changed its corporate name to enmon capital,arnold itkin insisted that,regardless of enmon obligations to arbitrate the dispute under the letter agreement,caprock was not similarly bound under the credit agreement,which contained no arbitration provision 
the district court concluded that enmon pending appeal divested it of jurisdiction to resolve the rule b motion,which it dismissed by order dated july,with the warning that it would not be inclined to grant the motion if the second circuit were to remand the case.in august,arnold itkin filed an appeal of the district court order denying enmon rule b motion,but it voluntarily withdrew the appeal in october.
the petition to confirm the arbitration award 
in april,the arbitrator designated to preside over the arbitration between prospect and enmon issued a preliminary decision in favor of prospect.among other things,the arbitrator found that the draft credit agreement was never consummated and that the letter agreement permitted prospect to refuse to finance enmon project.prospect immediately filed a petition to confirm arbitration with the district court.arnold itkin opposed the petition,urging that confirmation was premature because the arbitrability of the dispute was ripe for decision in the second circuit court of appeals.it also claimed that the arbitration had gone forward in a disjointed manner that prevented a fair presentation of the evidence,and that this disjointed manner included calling witness es out of order,not witnesses immediately after their direct testimony,and not allowing depositions.arnold itkin also rehashed several other arguments it had previously advanced to challenge arbitrability.
in a final award on august,the arbitrator directed enmon to pay prospect in attorneys fees,costs,and expenses.prospect then filed a renewed petition to confirm the arbitration award,which the district court granted in october.in november,arnold itkin appealed the confirmation of the award.because the appeal was defective,arnold itkin refiled a notice of appeal in january,but voluntarily withdrew that appeal in april.
in may,prospect moved pursuant to and the district court inherent power to recover attorneys fees and expenses associated with its litigation of the motion to compel arbitration,the texas tro,the rule b motion,confirmation of the arbitral awards both before the district court and on appeal,and the sanctions motion itself.after briefing and oral argument,the district court granted the motion for sanctions in part.it found that arnold itkin had acted in bad faith and engaged in frivolous and vexatious litigation in seeking the texas tro,bringing the rule b motion and subsequent appeal,and opposing prospect petition to confirm the arbitral award.
prospect then filed a proposed judgment for in fees incurred in connection with all of these matters.in june,the district court entered the proposed judgment against arnold itkin and further directed the firm to submit this court sanctions order with any future applications for admission pro hac vice in the southern district of new york.we interpret this directive to apply to every arnold itkin lawyer who seeks to be admitted pro hac vice in the southern district of new york.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
the district court imposed sanctions against arnold itkin pursuant to both its inherent powers and.in either case,we review the sanctions order for abuse of discretion,schlaifer nance estate of warhol,cir,to ensure that the district court sanctions are not based on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,wolters kluwer fin,scivantage,cir quoting schlaifer nance,at.because the trial court imposing sanctions may act as accuser,fact finder and sentencing judge all in one,schlaifer nance,at quoting mackler,cohen,cir,our review of such an order is more exacting than under the ordinary standard.wolters kluwer,at quoting perez danbury,cir.
in order to impose sanctions pursuant to its inherent power,a district court must find that the challenged claim was without a colorable basis and the claim was brought in bad faith,motivated by improper purposes such as harassment or delay.schlaifer nance,at see also id.at holding that a claim is entirely without color when it lacks any legal or factual basis.conversely,a claim is colorable when it has some legal and factual support,considered in light of the reasonable beliefs of the individual making the claim.internal citations omitted.although both findings must be supported by a high degree of specificity in the factual findings,wolters kluwer,at,bad faith may be inferred only if actions are so completely without merit as to require the conclusion that they must have been undertaken for some improper purpose such as delay,schlaifer nance,at citation omitted.
the showing of bad faith required to support sanctions under u.is similar to that necessary to invoke the court inherent power.oliveri thompson,cir.in practice,the only meaningful difference between an award made under and one made pursuant to the court inherent power is that awards under are made only against attorneys or other persons authorized to practice before the courts while an award made under the court inherent power may be made against an attorney,a party,or both.id.
the texas tro 
with these principles in mind,we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion when it sanctioned arnold itkin based on its particularized findings that arnold itkin acted without a colorable basis a finding that arnold itkin does not dispute and in bad faith in procuring the texas tro.the district court bad faith determination rested on the finding that arnold itkin failure to disclose that its texas tro application sought to enjoin a federal court action as opposed to a state court action constituted a misrepresentation by omission.
in support of these conclusions,the district court pointed to the face of the texas tro application,which specified it will do nothing but ensure the status quo is maintained,when in fact the tro sought to change the status quo by enjoining the sdny action.furthermore,the district court correctly noted that t he body of the tro request was noticeably silent as to the action already pending in federal court.
arnold itkin disputes the district court finding that it concealed the existence or nature of the sdny action from the texas state court.it notes that it attached an email from prospect counsel that referenced a pending proceeding in united states district court as an exhibit to its texas tro application,and that it alerted both courts to the existence of dueling tros in its letter dated january.
we are not persuaded that either of these documents demonstrates an absence of bad faith on arnold itkin part.the email was not cited in the text of the application itself,and the district court could properly have concluded that a vague,passing reference to united states district court in an email from opposing counsel attached as an exhibit was insufficient to disclose the critical fact that the application sought to enjoin a federal proceeding.indeed,the email also references arnold itkin pursuit of a stay of the new york aaa arbitration,suggesting that the purpose of the texas tro application was to stay an arbitration proceeding,not a federal district court case.nor are we persuaded that itkin january letter evidenced a lack of bad faith.the letter was not delivered until after the texas state court had already granted the texas tro and was,therefore,too little,too late.
arnold itkin also suggests that sanctions were unwarranted because the texas tro had no effect on the sdny action.we disagree that such an effect was required.in chambers nasco,d,for example,the supreme court upheld sanctions even though the sanctioned conduct had not disrupted the relevant litigation.the district court in chambers had enjoined the defendants from altering the status quo of a television station the plaintiffs sought to purchase pending final determination of the plaintiff suit to prevent a sale of the station to third parties.see nasco,calcasieu television and radio.after a bench trial on the merits and during the delay for submission of authorities,the defendants nevertheless petitioned the fcc for permission to change aspects of the television station site,in violation of the district court order.id.at.soon after the defendants made that application,the informal intervention of the district court,and the plaintiff threat of further contempt sanctions,persuaded the defendants to withdraw the application.id.at.the fcc application in chambers caused no disruption in the federal court action,and yet the supreme court affirmed the sanctions based on the defendants conduct before the fcc.chambers,at.
we read chambers to mean that sanctions may be warranted even where conduct does not disrupt the litigation before the sanctioning court.this accords with our sanctions jurisprudence,which counsels district courts to focus on the purpose rather than the effect of the sanctioned attorney activities.see schlaifer nance,at sanctions are appropriate if the challenged claim was without a colorable basis and the claim was brought in bad faith,motivated by improper purposes such as harassment or delay emphasis added.
here,the texas tro intended effect on the sdny action was greater than the intended effect of the fcc application on the litigation in chambers arnold itkin sought to enjoin the sdny action entirely.that arnold itkin attempt to derail the district court proceeding was quickly thwarted by vigilant opposing counsel does not make the firm purpose any less improper.
even if we were to focus on the effect of the conduct as opposed to its purpose,we are not persuaded that the texas tro actual effect on the sdny action was as minimal as arnold itkin now suggests.first,arnold itkin conduct multiplie d the proceedings before the district court by forcing prospect to seek its ow
