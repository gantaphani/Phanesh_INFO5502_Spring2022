appellants gerald crawford and michael warren appeal their criminal contempt convictions for violating a temporary restraining order tro or the order following a bench trial before judge richard arcara of the united states district court for the western district of new york.the appellants contend that the tro,which was issued by judge arcara on april,and extended on april,automatically expired pursuant to.b prior to the conduct at issue,and thus could not support a conviction for criminal contempt.we disagree and affirm the district court convictions for criminal contempt.
background 
the tro underlying this appeal was issued in new york operation rescue,d in that case,the plaintiffs the people of the state of new york,medical facilities and doctors who provide reproductive health care services,and other organizations who advocate choice for women with respect to abortion commenced suit on march,against defendants,including appellants crawford and warren.the plaintiffs sought a tro and preliminary injunction to establish limited buffer zones around abortion facilities in order to prevent the defendants from engaging in illegal activities designed to disrupt access to those abortion facilities.
judge arcara granted plaintiffs application for an expedited hearing on their motion for a tro on march.the hearing was scheduled for april,and the defendants were given until april,to respond to the motion.the defendants submitted various opposition papers on april and.
the tro hearing was held on april,and.gerald crawford and michael warren appeared at that hearing pro se.the defendants contested the tro,both legally and factually.several defendants submitted affidavits denying the factual allegations contained in plaintiffs complaint and motion papers.when the proceedings were concluded on april,judge arcara gave the parties until the following day to file any supplemental papers.he also set a briefing schedule before closing the record.additional affidavits were filed on april and.
on april,the district court issued a tro prohibiting the defendants from being present within buffer zones around reproductive health care facilities in the western district of new york.among other things,the tro prohibited the defendants 
at the reproductive health care facility of planned parenthood of the region from a demonstrating,congregating,standing,sitting,lying down,posting or carrying signs,or being present in or on any portion of the public sidewalk within a buffer zone measured from feet from the northwestern edge of the driveway entrance going towards north street,and measured from feet from the edge of the building going southeast towards scio street and at genesee hospital in rochester,new york,from a demonstrating,congregating,standing,sitting,lying down,posting or carrying signs,or being present within a buffer zone measured from fifteen feet from either edge of any driveway,walkway,or doorway entrance to such facility.
tro issued at a,a.according to the express terms of the tro,it was enforceable by a motion for criminal civil contempt,and was to remain in full force and effect until modified by further order,or until resolution of plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.tro issued at.
on april,the district court also issued an order scheduling a conference for april,and a preliminary injunction hearing for may.the district court converted the april conference into a status conference upon being advised that the parties were engaged in serious settlement discussions.in re criminal contempt proceedings against crawford,d.crawford and warren both appeared at the april conference through counsel,although they had previously appeared pro se.the parties reported that four defendants had already been dismissed from the case and that the parties wished to pursue additional settlement discussions.the district court,therefore,adjourned the preliminary injunction hearing to may,reminding the parties that the tro would continue to remain in effect until the completion of the hearing on the preliminary injunction.even though all of the defendants consented to the postponement of the preliminary injunction hearing,they also objected to the continuation of the tro.
on may,warren and crawford,and several other defendants,moved to sever the claims against them and to transfer those claims to rochester,new york,or instead to sever the claims against them for a separate proceeding and trial before judge arcara.judge arcara denied this motion on june,along with all other outstanding motions.see operation rescue,d at.
the hearing scheduled for may,was again adjourned at the request of the parties.instead,judge arcara held a status conference at which he was advised that several of the defendants had agreed to be bound by the tro and further injunctive relief by the district court,and that several other defendants would default if required to file an answer rather than agree to be bound by the tro.judge arcara decided to delay the preliminary injunction hearing until the settlement and default judgments were finalized and scheduled the preliminary injunction hearing for july.the hearing was adjourned until august,due to the district court trial calendar and a delay in finalizing the settlements and default judgments.by this time,only of the defendants remained in the case 
the preliminary injunction hearing lasted days,commencing on august,and ending on september.on august,during the preliminary injunction hearing,the plaintiffs applied for an order to show cause why gerald crawford and michael warren should not be held in criminal contempt for violating the april,tro on may,may,and july.judge arcara held a hearing on the order to show cause on august,and thereafter referred the matter to the united states attorney office for the western district of new york for investigation,and,if appropriate,for prosecution.
the united states filed a notice of criminal contempt notice against appellants gerald crawford and michael warren on march,pursuant to.the notice charged that one or both appellants,on three separate dates,knowingly and willfully disobeyed the tro entered by judge arcara on april.count one of the notice charged that warren violated the tro on may,by demonstrating against abortion on a public sidewalk within fifteen feet of a driveway at the genesee hospital,which was within the buffer zone.count two charged that on may,both warren and crawford demonstrated against abortion within fifteen feet of the genesee hospital,within the buffer zone.finally,count three charged both warren and crawford with demonstrating against abortion within the buffer zone at the planned parenthood clinic in rochester on july.
judge arcara denied the appellants motions to dismiss the contempt charges on february,and limited the appellants maximum punishment to six months imprisonment or a fine.both crawford and warren were tried in a bench trial on june.in re criminal contempt proceedings against crawford,d at.
on august,judge arcara found both appellants guilty of violating the april,tro and sentenced warren to three day concurrent sentences and crawford to two day concurrent sentences.both appellants sentences were stayed pending this appeal.
ii.discussion 
a.the criminal contempt convictions are valid 
rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure provides,in relevant part 
every temporary restraining order shall expire by its terms within such time after entry,not to exceed days,as the court fixes,unless within the time so fixed the order,for good cause shown,is extended for a like period or unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended for a longer period.
thus,a district court is permitted to extend a tro for a like period if good cause is shown.the supreme court has interpreted the phrase a like period as permitting a court to extend the tro for up to an additional days.granny goose foods,brotherhood of teamsters auto truck drivers local,d.
in this case,the district court extended the april,tro on april,until the preliminary injunction hearing was completed.the defendants contend that under rule b,the tro could only be extended wit
