background 
the evidence underlying the conviction,viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,jackson virginia,established the following facts.in,defendant peter paul paul and stan lee founded stan lee media slm,an multimedia production company.as a and head of the company,paul controlled a substantial amount of slm stock.paul placed portions of this stock into nominee accounts at merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,merrill lynch and spear,leeds kellogg,spear,leeds that he fully controlled,but maintained under other names to mask his involvement.
between and,paul and others began artificially inflating the price of slm stock by effecting trades between the nominee accounts,thereby making slm stock appear to be more liquid,and thus a less risky,investment.additionally,paul created a false appearance of higher than actual demand by directing others to execute uptick trades immediately prior to the daily close of public trading.in order to profit from the inflated stock price without having to sell his stock,paul drew on his nominee accounts to obtain margin loans totaling million.paul induced merrill lynch and spear,leeds to make the loans by fraudulently creating the nominee accounts,as he could not have properly obtained the loans otherwise.eventually,the plot collapsed and slm stock price began to decline steadily,falling to per share in december.as a result,the securities and exchange commission opened an investigation into the trading of slm stock.
in december,paul suddenly departed for brazil.on june,a grand jury in the eastern district of new york returned a indictment charging paul with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and securities fraud.between august and july,paul was incarcerated in brazil,awaiting extradition to the united states.paul was arraigned on september,and,on january,paul was released on bail,subject to home detention and electronic monitoring.
on march,paul pled guilty to count two of a superseding indictment which charged paul with securities fraud in violation of b and.paul remained in home detention with electronic monitoring until he appeared for sentencing more than four years later,on june.ultimately,the district court wexler,sentenced paul to months imprisonment,three years of supervised release,restitution of and a special assessment.
paul appeals,arguing that the district court violated his fifth amendment right to speedy sentencing imposed an unreasonable sentence erred in its ordering of restitution and violated his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial.in a july,unpublished order,we dismissed paul appeals relating to his right to a speedy trial and the reasonableness of the district court sentence because these appeals were barred by a waiver of appellate rights contained in paul plea agreement.on november,we granted paul motion for leave to file a supplemental letter brief asserting that the district court violated federal rule of criminal procedure c by improperly participating in plea negotiations.paul rule c argument is not foreclosed by his appellate waiver because it goes to the question of whether he entered his plea agreement knowingly and voluntarily.see united states pearson,cir.
for the following reasons,paul conviction and sentence are affirmed.
federal rule of criminal procedure c 
rule c outlines the procedure that the government and defense counsel must follow in coming to a plea agreement,and rule c specifically states that t he court must not participate in these discussions.c.this rule is in place because such discussion inevitably carries with it the high and unacceptable risk of coercing a defendant to accept the proposed agreement and plead guilty.united states bruce,cir.
in his,paul argues that the district court violated rule c when it made statements at a december,conference that,according to paul,were intended to pressure and coerce paul into pleading guilty,thereby casting doubt on the voluntariness of paul guilty plea approximately two months later.def.specifically,the district court stated that 
they not going to go to trial once we set a real date.i know that.and i saying that on the record.
most defense lawyers know with me you go to trial,after whatever the guidelines are,you get.you plead,and i considered lenient,so they know that and every effort will be made to plead before me rather than go to trial.
and they also know and let the second circuit know,i do think that i been reversed in a criminal trial in years.so you going to have to find,the clients are going to have to be found not guilty before they can walk.
paul argues that these statements compared a potential sentence following a guilty plea with a potential sentence following a guilty verdict and,therefore,coerced him into entering his guilty plea.
in addition,paul alleges that a remark made by the district court regarding his months of incarceration in brazil if he does have a plea,he not getting credit for that time was coercive,misleading,and misstate d the law.def.in making his argument,paul points out that only the bureau of prisons has the ability to credit him for the time spent incarcerated in brazil.
the government argues that the statements did not violate rule c because paul did not plead guilty until two months after the district court made the statements,paul was not present when the statements were made,and the transcript of the proceeding at which the statements were made was sealed until several years after the guilty plea was entered.in addition,the government argues that all of the cases cited by paul involved much more egregious conduct than the statements made by the district court in this case,and that,with respect to the first set of remarks,the district court was simply stating the sentencing law in effect at the time.
the second circuit only significant decision regarding rule c is united states werker,cir,but the facts in werker were particularly defendant attempted to plea bargain directly with the court.id.at.some circuits have indeed espoused a rule regarding remarks made by a trial court that touch on topics related to plea discussions.see,united states,cir t he court comparison of a sentence to a sentence was inherently coercive.bruce,at the command of rule c with regard to plea negotiations is simple and admits of no exceptions.but a closer review of the relevant caselaw suggests that a more discriminating examination of the remarks at the context in which they were the more prudent approach.we need not adopt a particular standard to apply to all potential c situations.it suffices simply to say that a rule is inappropriate for such an analysis.issues arising under rule c are highly and,as a result,such situations must be analyzed in terms of the purposes of the rule,and not with illogical rigidity.united states moses,cr,wl,at,citing,at united states frank,cir.
the statements made by the district court were made at a bail hearing,where counsel and the court were trying to fashion a package that would facilitate paul release.the hearing was in chambers and under seal.toward the end of the hearing,the district court made the first remark to which paul now objects.the discussion was not about paul,however,but rather about a trial date for all defendants.the district court made the observation that trial dates produce pleas because defendants gain an advantage by pleading.paul did not hear the district court remarks because he was not present.although it may be possible that his attorney conveyed the substance of the remarks to him,no reader of the transcript at issue would conclude that the remarks rose to the level of a violation of rule c.
this case is most analogous to united states bierd,cir.in bierd,the trial judge said,at sidebar and in the context of discussing a motion for severance why does he plead out,get the three levels he entitled to and then that will accomplish the severance,but that not for me to say.id.at.the defendant pled guilty the following day.id.given the circumstances,however,the first circuit found that the trial judge conduct was not so egregious as to require vacat ur of the conviction.id.at.
the first set of remarks made in this case are similar to the remarks in bierd in context and in scope.in both cases,the comments were made in a context having little to do with plea discussions.and in both cases,the statements suggested that a guilty plea would cause a reduction in accurate reflection of the sentencing law in effect at the time.as such,the first circuit conclusion that it sense d a distinct qualitative difference between statements found to require vacat ur and the comments made in bierd guides our decision here.id.at.the district court remarks were impromptu,unemphatic,and unrepeated,and,therefore,did not violate rule c.
the second remark made by the district court is even less concerning,as paul clearly takes this remark out of context.a review of the surrounding discussion clearly indicates that the district court was actually trying to secure paul release on bail,not trying to coerce a plea.specifically,the district court said he been over four years in jail.that a long period of time.the assistant united states attorney then stated that paul was getting credit for every minute of the time he had spent incarcerated.id.the district court disagreed n o,he is.id.the rest of the conversation continued as follows 
davis assistant united states attorney your honor,in a negotiated plea,if we were to have a negotiated i already conveyed this to paul counsel we would specifically ask for a finding by the court that the time that he spent in custody in brazil was based solely on the extradition request.
the court but if he does have a plea,he not getting credit for that time.
conway paul counsel that very possible.
the court generally,i not sure,but 
conway right.it been stated by the government do sic me,he not entitled to that if he goes to trial,because it was his delay that caused it,not the government.but i do know.i not making a determination.
conway it certainly an issue,your honor.
the court yes.it an issue.so i leaning to see if i can get him out,but i want a little more security.okay.
conway that fine.
id.whether or not the district court was correct or had the authority to comment on whether paul would get credit for the time he spent incarcerated is of no moment.given the context of the remark,it was not coercive in any way,shape,or form.the district court comments begin and end with its concern about getting paul released on bail.the rule against judicial participation in plea bargaining protects the parties against implicit or explicit pressure to settle criminal cases on terms favored by the judge.it does not establish a series of traps for imperfectly articulated oral remarks.frank,at.
even if the district court remarks constituted error which they do not,such error was certainly harmless.paul was not present when the remarks were made and he did not enter his guilty plea until several months following the proceeding at issue.any coercive effect would have had to have been communicated to paul by his counsel.neither paul nor his lawyer ever objected to the district court statements at any time prior to this appeal.any suggestion that paul counsel was concerned about the potentially coercive effect of such statements is completely unfounded.indeed,at paul hearing,when the district court asked paul whether he was making the plea of guilty voluntarily and of his own free will,paul answered,y es,and when the district court asked whether anyone threatened or forced him to plead guilty,paul answered,n.
in sum,the district court did not err in the circumstances presented here.paul requested relief is,accordingly,denied.
ii.the right to a speedy sentencing 
since paul did not raise an objection in the district court relating to his right to a speedy sentencing,we review his claim for plain error.see united states keppler,cir citing.b.in johnson united states,the supreme court articulated the standard for plain error review 
b efore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.
citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
t o determine whether a defendant has been deprived of his due process right to a prompt sentencing,we must consider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused.united states ray,cir citing united states lovasco,internal quotation marks omitted.these considerations are not evaluated independently as prongs in a test,but rather as related factors to be weighed in light of each other and the surrounding circumstances.see id.
reasons for the delay 
in considering the reasons for the delay,the supreme court has instructed that different weights should be assigned to different reasons.vermont brillon,citation omitted in the speedy trial context.while deliberate delay to hamper the defense weighs heavily against the prosecution,more neutral reasons such as negligence or overcrowded courts weigh less heavily but nevertheless should be considered ray,at internal punctuation omitted.courts should also consider the extent to which the defendant should bear responsibility for the delay.see id.
in the instant case,a large portion of the roughly four year delay before sentencing was due to the government inability to provide the probation department with certain evidence for calculating restitution and to allow a new assistant united states attorney to familiarize himself with the case.there is,however,no evidence to suggest that this was an anything more than an.in any event,negligence on the part of the government does not weigh as heavily as would an intentional delay.
the fourth and final year of the delay,however,is attributable solely to paul requests for adjournments.in addition,paul repeatedly attempted to delay the beginning of his prison term even after receiving his sentence.as such,it is clear that paul was in no immediate rush to receive his sentence or to begin serving it.
to prove a due process violation as a result of a sentencing delay,the prejudice claimed by the defendant must be substantial and demonstrable.ray,at citing perez sullivan,cir united states,cir.a defendant is prejudiced by a sentencing delay when imposing the sentence would interrupt his reintegration into the community in a way that the immediate imposition of sentence would not have.id.at.
paul first argues that the uncertainty of his fate left him in limbo with respect to employment prospects and his ability to make future arrangements for his family.indeed,delay in sentencing postpones the commitment of the defendant to corrections facilities,may have a detrimental effect on rehabilitation,and suspends the appellate review of error.ray,at.these harms,however,inevitably accompany any delay in sentencing and do not,in and of themselves,satisfy the substantial and demonstrable prejudice requirement.see id.at.
paul also contends that he took steps towards rehabilitation,such as reestablishing ties with his family and helping shareholders recover hidden assets from slm.in developing this argument,paul attempts to draw a comparison between himself and the defendant in ray.this comparison,however,is unavailing.the defendant in ray waited fifteen years for her sentencing hearing.ray,at.believing that her involvement with the criminal justice system was behind her,she obtained employment and paid taxes,married and raised a family,owned a home,and obtained higher education.id.at.on the contrary,however,paul waited four years for a sentencing hearing,all the while remaining in home detention.thus,at no time did paul believe that the matter was behind him,nor did he have the opportunity to fully reintegrate into society.
lastly,paul claims that his incarceration was detrimental to his autistic son,who had become reliant on paul during the interim period.the son doctor reported that the child was very attached to his father,and voiced concern that paul incarceration might have a detrimental effect on the child.the doctor also,however,noted that the effect of paul
