this is an appeal from a default judgment.in the course of a traffic stop the government seized in currency and filed a complaint against it for forfeiture pursuant to a.white and jackson filed a b motion to dismiss based on the theory that the government failed to plead facts establishing probable cause with sufficient particularity so as to satisfy rule e a of the supplemental rules for admiralty and maritime claims hereinafter,rule e a the district court denied the motion to dismiss,finding that the government need not establish probable cause for the seizure at the pleading stage of litigation,and in the same order,granted the government motion for rule sanctions in the form of the entry of default judgment in the government favor,thereby terminating white and jackson claims.appeal both rulings.
a.the stop and seizure 
at on the morning of march,dequilla white was the subject of a traffic stop on.the stop was executed by sergeant fountain of the jefferson county sheriff department who averred that he initially stopped white because white crossed onto the shoulder while driving.upon approaching white vehicle,fountain observed that white passenger,melvin morris,was not wearing a seatbelt,as is mandated by texas law.
the officers obtained consent to search the vehicle and found a pistol,a garment bag,and no other luggage.inside the garment bag was in cash,divided into seven bundles each bearing a small piece of paper denoting the amount.the government asserts that this is a common method of carrying currency in transactions.
when asked to explain the presence of the money,initially white allegedly reported that it belonged to three different people who had entrusted it to white so that he could purchase property on their behalf in leesville.after a narcotics dog alerted to the presence of narcotics on the currency,white allegedly told the officers that he had actually received the money from one individual,michael jackson,in order to purchase three pieces of real property in leesville on jackson behalf.white asserted that he was to purchase the property at an auction,but that the location of the auction was,at that time,unknown to him.
morris was questioned separately during the stop.the officers noted discrepancies between white and morris explanation of their activities and plans.a search of morris turned up a slip of paper in morris shoe which appeared to the officers to be a receipt,and which contained what officers believed to resemble calculations made based on the price of a kilogram of cocaine.
white and morris were read their miranda rights and released from the scene.the currency was seized for forfeiture proceedings.
forfeiture action 
on august,the government filed a complaint for forfeiture against currency under a the affidavit of officer permenter was attached,which the district court found contained details of the stop and seizure,tending to show probable cause for the complaint.on september,dana white filed a claim and answer.michael jackson filed his claim and answer on october,the government served a formal disclosure on claimants on october,and served a request for discovery and interrogatories on december.
then began what the government contends,and what the record reflects,was a protracted campaign to extract discovery from claimants.first,after what the government alleges were multiple promises from claimants counsel that formal disclosures,answers to interrogatories,and requested documents were on the way,the government counsel agreed to travel to baton rouge on february,to personally retrieve the discovery.however,upon review of the documents which claimants rendered,the government notified claimants that the discovery was inadequate,that in particular there were no disclosures,and that the answers to interrogatories and production requests were incomplete on april,having received no response,the government filed a motion to compel,which the court granted may.claimants were ordered to produce outstanding discovery by june.on june,having still received nothing further from claimants,the government notified claimants counsel that the government planned to file a motion to strike claimants pleadings and enter judgment for the government,if claimants failed to comply with the court order to compel by june.
on july,claimants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.simultaneously,claimants supplied the government with additional discovery documents which the government deemed incomplete and insufficient to comply with the district court order of may.the next day the government moved for sanctions against claimants for failure to comply with the order to compel discovery.specifically,the government motion requested the claimants pleading be struck and default judgment entered in favor of the government.
the district court conducted a combined motion hearing to consider both claimants motion to dismiss and the government motion for sanctions.on november,the district court denied the motion to dismiss,granted the governments motion for sanctions,and entered a default judgment against the currency in favor of the government.now appeal the district court rulings.
points of appeal 
present two issues for appeal.first they protest the denial of their motion to dismiss,in which they argued that the government complaint was not pled with sufficient particularity under rule e a.in support of this point,charge that the district court applied the wrong standard in evaluating their motion to dismiss the complaint,and that,as a result,the district court erred in failing to dismiss the complaint 
second point of appeal challenges the district court decision to grant the government motion for rule sanctions,a decision which resulted in the termination of their claims 
moreover,synthesize and construct an interesting interdependency between their two points of appeal,contending that if this court finds in their favor regarding the motion to dismiss,the question of sanctions becomes moot.in this,however,are mistaken we find that the two motions were not interdependent,but instead that the district court sanctioned for behavior unrelated to the sufficiency of the complaint the district court sanctioned for failure to comply with a court order,and misconduct in failing to comply with the court order was in no way related to the sufficiency of the government pleading.therefore,regardless of whether the complaint was sufficiently pled,noncompliance with the order remained subject to sanction.thus,assuming the district court did not abuse its discretion in entering default judgment in the government we find herein that it did need not reach the question of whether the government complaint was indeed sufficient under the standard set forth by rule e a.consequently,because the district court acted appropriately in entering default judgment in the government favor,we can afford no relief herein.
rule sanction 
because we find the issue dispositive as to the appeal at bar,we turn first to consider challenge to the district court sanction ruling.contest the district court decision to grant the government motion for sanctions pursuant to rule b c.rule b c authorizes the district court to strike pleadings or render a default judgment against a party as a sanction for failure to comply with a discovery order.b.
