the appellants are employees of the cuyahoga county juvenile court the ccjc and their attorney merrie frost.they appeal the district court order imposing costs and attorney fees against them for maintaining frivolous discrimination claims long after those claims had clearly become groundless.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district court,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
parties on appeal 
the ccjc itself was neither a party below nor is a party to this appeal,even though this case has been styled garner cuyahoga county juvenile court.instead,the appellees are a number of the ccjc administrators and supervisors who were sued in both their official and individual capacities.because a suit against individuals in their official capacities is legally the same as a suit against the public entity employing them,they will be henceforth referred to as the ccjc.numerous employees brought suit against the ccjc,alleging that it wrongfully terminated them in violation of ohio law,that it violated their rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,and that it retaliated against them for engaging in activities that are protected by law,such as the filing of a civil rights lawsuit.some of the employees also claimed that the ccjc intentionally subjected them to emotional distress.
not all of the original,however,are appellants in this case.the ones who have appealed are spencer bellamy,sonja colwell,tiffanie dennis,anthony garner,shelley isom,terrance jenkins,heather mccollough,monique moore,nathaniel prather,bruce richardson,and thomas washington collectively,the employees.this appeal does not concern the merits of the employees claims because this court has already addressed those claims in a prior proceeding.see garner cuyahoga cty.juvenile.cir affirming the district court order granting the ccjc motion for summary judgment with respect to all of the claims raised by the employees,cert.denied,d.instead,the employees are contesting the district court order holding them jointly and severally liable for the ccjc attorney fees.
attorney frost is also named as an appellant.she contests the district court decision to sanction her by holding her jointly and severally liable for the same award of attorney fees to the ccjc.for convenience,we will refer to the employees and frost together as the appellants.
procedural background 
the district court opinion provides a comprehensive procedural history.that history will not be recounted here except to the extent relevant to this appeal.
the district court summary judgment orders 
attorneys merrie frost and timothy ita independently filed,on behalf of their respective clients,a total of three separate lawsuits in state court against the ccjc.these cases were each removed to federal court on the basis of federal jurisdiction and later consolidated.the consolidated federal complaint listed and included the following counts termination in violation of ohio public policy,employment discrimination in violation of ohio revised code,an equal protection violation brought pursuant to,malicious conduct warranting a punitive damages award,and intentional infliction of emotional distress,unlawful retaliatory discharge and discipline,civil conspiracy,and civil aiding and abetting.garner.at.the employees requested,among other things,compensatory and punitive damages in excess of million.this court has previously described the motion practice that followed 
in july of,ccjc filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings against bellamy,moore,and washington,arguing that the federal claims raised by these three employees were barred by the statute of limitations because they had not been employed by ccjc within two years preceding the action.while this motion was pending,the discovery deadline was set for july.in september of,ccjc filed a motion requesting that the district court increase the page limit for dispositive motions from pages to pages,which the court denied.also in september of months after the discovery deadline had plaintiffs requested leave to take an additional deposition,which the court also denied.
ccjc soon thereafter filed motions for summary judgment,pertaining to all the employees other than bellamy,moore,and washington.the employees filed an opposing memorandum accompanied by affidavits and exhibits.at a pretrial conference following the filing of the summary judgment motions and the response,the district court,on its own initiative,permitted the employees to file an additional memorandum in opposition to ccjc summary judgment motions.they did so in december of.
also in december of,ccjc sought a continuance of the trial date,originally set for january of,in part due to the pendency of the dispositive motions.the district court agreed to set aside the january trial date.on december,the employees filed a motion to update affidavits and exhibits in response to ccjc motions for summary judgment.the district court denied the employees motion,reasoning that the deadline had long passed.
by march of,the district court had granted summary judgment in favor of ccjc with respect to all of the employees,including bellamy,moore,and washington.
individual summary judgment orders,including more than pages of discussion,were issued by the district court.all of the orders granted summary judgment in favor of the ccjc.this court affirmed the various orders on appeal,explaining as follows 
the district court held that bellamy,brown,dennis,garner,isom,lilly,moore,richardson,and washington had failed to present any evidence to support their state and federal claims of racially motivated employment discrimination and retaliation.it further held that colwell,jenkins,mcnear,mccollough,and prather had failed to present sufficient evidence to support their claims.aside from the differences between the failure to present any evidence and the failure to present sufficient evidence,the district court summary judgment orders contain remarkably similar legal analysis.
although the employees argue that the district court ignored or changed important evidence of racial discrimination on the part of ccjc,this contention is unsupported by the record.the district court engaged in a careful analysis of the facts as they pertained to each employee claims,and it determined that the allegations of racial discrimination and other unlawful behavior were unfounded.in their brief,the employees continue to proffer the same assertions raised below,failing in almost all instances to cite to the record.not only do the employees fail to base their allegations on facts in the record,they also fail to offer any relevant criticism of the district court legal analysis.
because the reasoning that supports summary judgment for ccjc has been clearly articulated by the district court in its thorough and opinions,and because we are unpersuaded by the employees argument that the court displayed favoritism and bias in rendering its procedural orders,the issuance by us of a detailed written opinion would be unduly duplicative.
id.at emphases in original.
imposition and calculation of costs and attorney fees on the employees 
the ccjc subsequently sought to recoup the expenses associated with defending itself against the employees claims in light of its successful summary judgment motions.it filed motions requesting an award of costs pursuant to rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure and sought attorney fees under.
the district court granted the ccjc motion for costs under rule d in august.in a separate order issued in march,the court held of the employees jointly and severally liable for those costs in the amount of.those employees are bellamy,brown,dennis,garner,isom,jenkins,lilly,mccollough,mcnear,moore,prather,richardson and washington.because colwell had filed for bankruptcy,she was excluded from this judgment.the employees have waived arguments relating to this award of costs.see part.below.
in an earlier order issued in october,the district court had imposed attorney fees on of the employees,pursuant to b,for filing claims that were frivolous,unreasonable,and without foundation,and because these employees should have dismissed their claims after discovery had shown that they were without factual support.the court reached this conclusion despite being very aware that awarding attorney fees to the defendants under in a case such as this may have a chilling effect on potentially meritorious civil rights employees,and after acknowledging that it was an extreme sanction.the court concluded that 
the defendants are entitled to attorney fees for the preparation of motions for summary judgment pertaining to all of the employees claims except those of employees jenkins,mccollough,prather and wesley who was voluntarily dismissed and the following claims of employees washington,bellamy,and moore which were dismissed by stipulation count iii,claims brought under section count v,retaliation count vi,respondeat superior count vii,civil conspiracy and,count viii,civil.
brackets added.
those employees ultimately held jointly and severally liable to satisfy the award imposed under were bellamy,brown,dennis,garner,isom,lilly,mcnear,moore,richardson,and washington.in other words,with the exception of jenkins,mccollough,and prather,every employee who was held liable for costs under rule d was also held jointly and severally liable for attorney fees.the latter three employees were excluded from the award because the court determined that some of their claims were not frivolous.as previously noted,colwell was excluded from this group because she filed for bankruptcy,and wesley was excluded from both the awards of costs and attorney fees because he had already been voluntarily dismissed as a party.
to support its finding that the employees claims were frivolous,the district court addressed the evidentiary lack respect to each count of the consolidated complaint.reproducing that discussion in full would unnecessarily duplicate the district court lengthy opinion.we will highlight,nonetheless,some of the district court findings to provide context for the analysis that is set forth in part ii.below.
virtually all the employees claimed that the ccjc discriminated against them on the basis of their race,retaliated against them for engaging in protected activity in violation of ohio revised code i,wrongfully discharged them in violation of public policy which is a cause of action available to employees only,intentionally subjected them to emotional distress.in general,the court found that most of the claims of employees bellamy,brown,dennis,garner,isom,lilly,mcnear,moore,richardson,and washington were frivolous,unreasonable,and without foundation.
despite finding that most of the employees claims were frivolous,the district court did not think that all of them were.the court distinguished between two categories of employees those who failed to provide any evidence in support of their claims,and those who failed to provide sufficient evidence.emphases in original.labeling the first category as those who failed to provide any evidence is potentially misleading,however.the court did not likely mean that the employees in this group failed to proffer evidence to satisfy any of the elements of their claims.some of the employees,for example,easily satisfied an essential element of their claims by establishing that they had in fact been terminated.instead,the court seemingly intended the category to include those employees who failed to satisfy a basic element of their claims even after discovery had shown that they were without evidentiary support.the court placed the following employees in the group bellamy,brown,dennis,garner,isom,jenkins,lilly,moore,richardson,and washington.except for jenkins,everyone in this group was ultimately held jointly and severally liable for attorney fees under.
the group included colwell,mccollough,mcnear,and prather.jenkins was also put in this group,although the district court failed to explain why it placed him in both categories.in any event,the group appears to reflect the district court acknowledgment that s ome of the claims of the employees were not frivolous.the district court addressed the claims of jenkins,mccollough,and prather in particular.these employees lost on summary judgment just like the members of the group.nevertheless,the district court found that their claims were not wholly frivolous because they were able to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination,even though they were unable to show that the ccjc proffered legitimate reasons for the alleged adverse actions against them were simply pretexts to mask discrimination.ultimately,neither jenkins,mccollough,nor prather were held jointly and severally liable for attorney fees under.
the district court did not indicate why it included colwell in the group.colwell was presumably included because she provided at least a scintilla of evidence to support her discrimination claims.specifically,colwell alleged that one of her supervisors referred to another employee as a white boy,referred to officers as his people,and said that you people do understand,you not the same grade.as with jenkins,mccollough,and prather,the district court did not hold colwell jointly and severally liable for the attorney fees,and she is not involved in this appeal due to her filing for bankruptcy.
mcnear was also placed in the category,although the record is again not clear as to why.the court reiterated its conclusion,first expressed at the summary judgment stage of the case,that because mcnear did not suffer a materially adverse employment action,she had failed to establish a prima facie claim of retaliation under ohio revised code i.mcnear is nonetheless the only employee in the group that the district court held jointly and severally liable for the attorney fees.
other employees alleged retaliation claims under ohio law that were in some ways similar to mcnear claim.brown,colwell,isom,and mccollough each stated that the ccjc subjected them to adverse employment actions as a result of participating in protected activity,including this litigation.for example,isom claimed that,by forcing her to use vacation time to attend to her duties as a plaintiff,the ccjc retaliated against her for filing suit against it.but the district court noted that they failed to establish a causal connection between the filing of the case at bar and the ccjc requirement that they use personal time to attend to matters related to the case at bar.
the preceding examples are highlights of the reasoning behind the district court determinations that the employees filed frivolous claims.having found the employees liable for costs and attorney fees,however,the court still had to determine how much the ccjc was entitled to receive.the ccjc requested in attorney fees,which it computed by adding litigation fees that were presumably fees attributable to discovery,fees attributable to defending against the claims brought by garner,richardson,brown,dennis,isom,and mcnear,fees attributable to defending against the claims brought by moore,bellamy,and washington,trial preparation fees,and the expense of trying to recover attorney fees and costs from the employees.in a march order,the district court found that the documentation that the ccjc submitted supporting these figures was adequate.
pursuant to the district court october order,the ccjc request of did not include any time spent defending against the claims of jenkins,mccollough,and prather.the court also refused to permit the ccjc to recover fees for preparing a motion to compel discovery because the pleading violated a local discovery rule obligating the parties to contact the court by phone before filing certain discovery motions.approximately was therefore subtracted from the ccjc request.that left that the ccjc was allowed to recover from the employees for filing frivolous suits.
imposition and calculation of sanctions against the employees attorneys 
in addition to the ccjc asking the district court to award it costs under rule and attorney fees under,the ccjc asked the court to impose sanctions against the employees attorneys under,rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,ohio revised code,and the court inherent authority.the court granted that request pursuant to,but denied the request to the extent that it was based on rule,ohio law,or the court inherent authority.in reviewing the request,the court observed t here is indeed little,if any,evidentiary support for any of those claims in this record,and no reasonably prudent attorney,having performed an ongoing investigation,would have filed or continued prosecuting those claims.the district court explained its decision to impose sanctions as follows 
attorneys frost and ita engaged in conduct proscribed by which multiplied the litigation unreasonably or vexatiously.the conduct also caused excess costs.because the court believes that employees counsel intentionally pursued meritless claims,the court will award the defendants fees under for the hours related to the preparation of the summary judgment motions and some of the discovery conducted by the parties.
the court recognizes that the extensive discovery requested and responded to by the defendants in order to prevail on summary judgment does not constitute vexatious conduct on behalf of employees counsel.however,the employees claims in the case at bar were shown to be patently without merit in their responses to written discovery.defendants issued each plaintiff detailed interrogatories,requests for admissions,and requests for documents,asking the employees to identify each and every instance in which they had been personally subjected to acts of discrimination,acts of harassment,treated differently based on their race,retaliated against,or been subject to a hostile environment as a result of each individual defendant actions.moreover,the court had to resolve the discovery issues that remained between the parties at a conference conducted on may.
having decided that sanctions against attorneys frost and ita were appropriate,the district court still had to determine the appropriate amount.before the court issued its final judgment setting the amount of the total awards under rule,and,however,attorney ita filed a motion that requested permission to withdraw retroactively nunc pro tunc and to be excused from paying the sanctions.
in an affidavit and explanatory memorandum,ita noted that frost had left his law firm on october.he claimed that he was not involved in this litigation after that date.ita asserted,moreover,that none of his behavior in this case could reasonably be characterized as vexatious.he nevertheless acknowledged that he should have filed a motion to withdraw at an earlier date.in early february,the district court granted ita motion to withdraw nunc pro tunc and excused him from paying the attorney fees,noting that although the employees had some disagreement about the factual allegations in attorney ita affidavit,they otherwise had no other response.this left frost as the only remaining attorney subject to sanctions.
having previously determined that frost was subject to sanctions under,the district court held that the appropriate sanction was to make her jointly and severally liable for the award previously imposed on the employees.the district court did not explain why this amount was an appropriate sanction under.
this appeal 
a month after the district court final order determining the amount of costs and attorney fees owed,eight of the employees who were held jointly and severally liable filed a timely notice of appeal.the notice specifically states that the appellants are appealing the order granting the defendants sanctions in the amount of.brown and lilly were not named in the notice of appeal even though they were among those held jointly and severally liable.but colwell,jenkins,mccollough,and prather are named in the notice even though they were not ordered to pay the award.in sum,the remaining are bellamy,colwell,dennis,garner,isom,jenkins,mccollough,mcnear,moore,prather,richardson,and washington.finally,in october,we granted a motion filed by the national employment lawyers association nela requesting permission to file a brief as amicus curiae on behalf of the appellants.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the appellants assert,without citing any authority,that we should review all of the district court rulings de novo.but this assertion is contrary to the rule that we will review a district court award of attorneys fees under based on an abuse of discretion standard.sensations,city of grand rapids,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we also review a district court imposition of sanctions on an attorney pursuant to under the same standard.dixon clem,cir.
abuse of discretion is defined as a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.berger city of mayfield heights,cir citation omitted.such an error occurs where the district court relies upon clearly erroneous factual findings,applies the law improperly,or uses an erroneous legal standard.wikol ex rel.wikol birmingham pub.sch.bd.of,cir.furthermore,i n light of a district court superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters,an award of attorneys fees under is entitled to substantial deference.lake county sheriff dep t,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
imposition of costs against the employees under rule d 
before reaching the merits of this appeal,we note that the appellants apparently do not contest the award of costs that the district court imposed under rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure.the appellants notice of appeal specifically states that they challenge the court order granting the defendants sanctions in the amount of,but is silent as to the award of the in costs.nor does the appellants brief mention the imposition of costs against the employees.indeed,rule d is never even cited in the brief.we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider the district court ruling as to the imposition of costs.
imposition of joint and several liability for attorney fees under 
turning to the issues raised on appeal,the employees contend that the district court erred by concluding that their claims were frivolous.before assessing their arguments,however,we need to resolve a threshold issue about whether all of the employees named in the notice of appeal are appropriately considered appellants.
some of the appellants named in the notice of appeal do not present appealable issues 
there are a total of appellants named in the notice of appeal employees and attorney frost.of the employees,of,jenkins,mccollough,and no reason to appeal the award of attorney fees because the district court did not hold them liable for the award.the court did not impose either costs or attorney fees on colwell because she filed for bankruptcy.as for jenkins,mccollough,and prather,the district court held that some of their claims were not frivolous and therefore did not impose attorney fees on them under.these latter three appellants are still subject to the award of costs under rule d,however,because they have not appealed that award.see part.above.colwell,jenkins,mccollough,and prather therefore have no stake in this appeal because they are not liable for the attorney fees in question and have waived any arguments against the award of costs imposed under rule d.this leaves the following eight employees who still have a stake in this appeal bellamy,dennis,garner,isom,mcnear,moore,richardson,and washington.before discussing their claims,the applicable legal framework is described below.
legal framework for imposing attorney fees 
the appellants core argument is that,because their legal claims were allegedly not frivolous,the district court abused its discretion in granting attorney fees to the ccjc under.section provides that the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs b.in reviewing the court award under this section,we recognize that awarding attorney fees against a nonprevailing plaintiff in a civil rights action is an extreme sanction,and must be limited to truly egregious cases of misconduct.jones cont l,cir.the supreme court has cautioned that 
it is important that a district court resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that,because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail,his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation.this kind of hindsight logic could discourage all but the most airtight claims,for seldom can a prospective plaintiff be sure of ultimate success.no matter how honest one belief that he has been the victim of discrimination,no matter how meritorious one claim may appear at the outset,the course of litigation is rarely predictable.decisive facts may not emerge until discovery or trial.the law may change or clarify in the midst of litigation.even when the law or the facts appear questionable or unfavorable at the outset,a party may have an entirely reasonable ground for bringing suit 
hence,a plaintiff should not be assessed his opponent attorney fees unless a court finds that his claim was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless,or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.
christiansburg garment eeoc,d.
against the backdrop of christiansburg cautionary language,this court has held that a prevailing defendant should only recover upon a finding by the district court that the plaintiff action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation,even though not brought in subjective bad faith.wayne village of sebring,cir quoting christiansburg,at.emphasis in original.to determine whether a suit is frivolous,we consider whether the issue is one of first impression requiring judicial resolution,whether the controversy is sufficiently based upon a real threat of injury to the plaintiff,whether the trial court has made a finding that the suit was frivolous under the christiansburg guidelines,and whether the record would support such a finding.tarter raybuck,cir quoting reichenberger pritchard,cir citations omitted.we must also review the record below to determine whether the district court finding is factually supported.riddle egensperger,cir.
courts must be particularly careful in conducting hearings to determine whether sanctions should be imposed against both plaintiffs and their attorneys for bringing frivolous claims.these situations are especially prone to raise conflicts of interest because each has an incentive to blame the other for bringing the frivolous claims at issue.in addition,such cases create an incentive for attorneys to abandon their clients in order to avoid personal liability.see in re ruben,cir pointing out the inherent problem in a sanction hearing addressed to both a plaintiff and her attorneys,where the plaintiff and attorneys are not separately represented.we turn now to discuss whether the employees claims were properly deemed to be frivolous.
the arguments as developed by nela amicus brief on behalf of the employees are often clearer than those presented in the appellants brief.we will therefore refer to nela arguments throughout the following analysis.see universal city studios,corley,cir noting that an amicus brief can be helpful in elaborating issues properly presented by the parties.
nela argues that the record shows significant evidence of disparate treatment that the district court did not acknowledge.the first example nela provides is that colwell,jenkins,and mccollough were rejected for a shelter care coordinator position in favor of a caucasian with less experience.nela adds that,with respect to mccollough,this decision was accompanied by a comment from an administrator saying that he sent the white boy over to get the job.but all of this evidence is irrelevant to the issue on appeal because the district court did not hold colwell,jenkins,or mccollough liable for the attorney fees in question.
nela brief also avers that there was sufficient evidence of discriminatory disciplinary treatment,providing four examples the termination of garner and moore after they reported allegedly illegal activities,the discipline or attempted discipline of dennis,isom,mcnear,and prather for infractions for which caucasian employees were allegedly not disciplined,bellamy suspension for having reported allegedly illegal activities of her supervisor,and an allegedly false accusation made against brown.the ccjc responds that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding these claims frivolous because none of the employees on appeal could establish any racial dimension to their claims and that n one could establish a prima facie case of discrimination.
neither nela nor the ccjc arguments are entirely persuasive.nela argument is unpersuasive because it implies that,because certain employees were able to satisfy a few elements of their prima facie case for a claim,their claims were for that reason alone not frivolous.if that were the case,then any plaintiff who could partially satisfy his or her prima facie case could confidently evade an award of attorney fees under.this implication stands in tension with christiansburg,which permits district courts to impose attorney fees if a plaintiff continues to litigate after the claim clearly becomes frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.see at.
but the ccjc argument is not wholly persuasive either.part of the ccjc argument,as formulated,proves too much.in particular,the ccjc seems to suggest that wherever a plaintiff fails to state a prima facie case for discrimination,an award for attorney fees against the plaintiff is appropriate.this argument is unpersuasive because it also diverges from christiansburg cautionary language,which counsels that a party may have an entirely reasonable ground for bringing suit even though he might not ultimately prevail.see id.at.in the context of a claim,the question of whether a plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of discrimination might be a close one.a claim likely would not be frivolous under such circumstances.
the appellants have raised a serious issue.if we were reviewing the district court determinations de novo,there might be room for reasonable disagreement regarding whether some of the employees claims warranted a finding of frivolousness.but the applicable standard of review requires us to give substantial deference to the court finding i n light of a district court superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters lake county sheriff dep t,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
both the appellants and nela argue,however,that because attorney frost previously won a claim against the ccjc,this somehow suggests that the present case was not entirely frivolous.nela also contends that the ccjc prior acts of discrimination are relevant to the present case.in support of this argument,nela cites spulak k mart,cir,for the proposition that a s a general rule,the testimony of other employees about their treatment by the defendant is relevant to the issue of the employer discriminatory intent.id.at.the ccjc responds that t he fact that another former employee obtained a favorable verdict in a case that remains subject to appellate proceedings does not establish that these employees personal claims had any merit.
we find the ccjc response persuasive.nothing in particular can be inferred from the bare fact of a prior adverse verdict against the ccjc.such an inference would imply that any employer who has lost a discrimination claim would be permanently barred from recovering attorney fees against subsequent frivolous claimants.the appellants would have had a stronger argument if they had presented relevant evidence deriving from frost prior successful jury verdict against the ccjc.they have not done so.we therefore reject the argument that a prior adverse verdict against the ccjc,in and of itself,provides evidence that the present claims were not frivolous.
finally,the record indicates that colwell and of whom are not subject to the isolated ccjc comments that were tinged with racial overtones.but this does not permit the other employees to insulate themselves from an award by pointing to the thin evidence provided by colwell and mccollough.such a holding would encourage frivolous claimants to piggyback on the nonfrivolous claims of legitimate plaintiffs.if colwell and mccollough evidence of ccjc discrimination were stronger,and if the other employees had established a clear nexus between themselves and that evidence,then we might have reached a different conclusion.
in sum,the appellants have not pointed to any relevant evidence in the record,or proffered convincing legal arguments,that suffice to show that the district court abused its discretion.we therefore find no error with the court conclusion that the employees claims were frivolous.
with respect to the claims,the district court determined that the employees failed to identify a specific policy that disproportionately harmed employees.the most salient policy identified in the record was a process involving comprehensive position questionnaires cpqs.these cpqs were designed by a consultant to help the ccjc develop a wage and salary plan that was internally equitable and externally competitive with other courts.employees were required to fill out cpqs,which were then used to modify pay,title,job grade,and job requirements.
as a result of the cpq process,ccjc data showed that of employees received a position upgrade,while only of caucasians did.the ccjc promoted employees,including and caucasians between january and august.these statistics are hardly supportive of the appellants claims.
the employees,moreover,never hired an expert to contest the ccjc statistics.although attorney frost originally told the district court that she planned to hire an expert statistician to look at the relationship between race and the employees pay rates and promotions,and that the expert would speak to both liability and damages,she never did so.the court observed that a s a result of the employees placing the entire cpq process at issue,it was necessary for the defendants to obtain an expert review and opinion of the process in order to defend against the disparate impact claims alleged by the employees.in light of the ccjc uncontested data,the court found that the employees claims were frivolous.
nela responds by arguing that the district court analysis of the hiring system and process was deeply flawed because the court improperly relied only on raw numbers.furthermore,nela points to isolated portions of the record that allegedly show informal filling of positions by caucasian employees,job segregation,disparate pay practices,and disparate discipline.
despite nela attempt to articulate specific ccjc policies retrospectively by piecing together fragments of previous factual allegations,there is no indication that the appellants took the claims seriously.the district court correctly observed that the employees,instead of identifying a specific practice that allegedly caused a disparate impact,simply provided a laundry list of isolated incidents of purported discrimination without providing evidence of their impact upon the entire class.an even stronger indication that the appellants did not take their claims seriously is that they failed to hire an expert to either refute the ccjc employment statistics or to identify a ccjc policy that created a disparate impact,even though attorney frost told the trial court that she intended to do so.neither the appellants nor nela has pointed to anything in the record causing us to form a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment regarding the claims.see berger city of mayfield heights,cir citation omitted.
retaliation 
the next group of claims addressed by the appellants involves retaliation.of the appellants who still have a stake in this litigation,the following seven alleged claims of unlawful retaliation under ohio revised code i bellamy,dennis,garner,isom,mcnear,moore,and washington.for retaliation claims in ohio,federal law provides the applicable analysis for reviewing retaliation claims.baker buschman,ohio app d,citation omitted.
under the applicable federal framework,the provision of title vii protects an individual not from all retaliation,but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm.burlington northern and santa fe ry.white,d.a prima facie case of retaliation requires a plaintiff to establish that 
she engaged in activity protected by title vii this exercise of protected rights was known to defendant defendant thereafter took adverse employment action against the plaintiff,or the plaintiff was subjected to severe or pervasive retaliatory harassment by a supervisor and there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action or harassment.
morris oldham fiscal,cir.to establish an adverse employment action under the third prong,a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.burlington northern,at.citation and internal quotations omitted.
the district court held that all of the appellants retaliation claims were frivolous.in particular,the district court found that brown,garner,isom,and moore failed to establish a causal connection between the filing of the case at bar and the ccjc requirement that they use personal time to attend to matters related to the case at bar.dennis,according to the court,did not identify any act of retaliation causally linked to her filing a charge with the eeoc.the court found that bellamy and washington did not engage in any activity protected by ohio i that could serve as the basis for a retaliation claim.finally,mcnear claim failed because the court held that she did not suffer a materially adverse employment action.
nela argues that the district court applied an erroneous legal standard because the definition of an adverse action,an employer adverse conduct against an employee in response to that employee engaging in a protected changed pursuant to the supreme court decision in burlington northern,at.holding that an adverse action is one that well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from engaging in conduct protected by title vii.
with respect to the retaliation claims brought by bellamy,brown,dennis,garner,isom,moore,and washington,nela argument is not persuasive.the district court found their claims to be frivolous for reasons unrelated to their ability to establish the existence of an adverse employment action.as previously noted,the court held that brown,dennis,garner,isom,and moore failed to proffer any evidence of causation.bellamy and washington claims,on the other hand,were patently frivolous because they failed to show that they were engaged in an activity protected by ohio law for the purposes of establishing a claim of retaliation.nela argument is therefore nonresponsive with respect to these employees.
but mcnear retaliation claim merits further discussion.the district court included mcnear in the group of employees who presented insufficient,what we have called the group.see part.above.by including mcnear in this group,the court implied that at least one of her claims was not frivolous.this appears to be inconsistent with the court conclusion that she should be treated as if she were part of the no evidence group that has been ordered to pay attorney fees under.
despite this apparent discrepancy,we find no error in the ultimate result.if anything,the district court error was to include mcnear in the group,as opposed to the group,because even mcnear strongest found groundless on the basis that mcnear failed to establish a materially adverse employment action.in particular,the court stated that 
mcnear did not suffer a materially adverse employment action due to a physical transfer to a different court building in august defendant david demand that she return a key to the detention center after she received a promotion and was transferred from the detention services department or the prohibition against eating lunch in her office adjacent to a magistrate courtroom.
the second and third actions listed above are indeed rather flimsy attempts to establish adverse employment actions.nor does the record indicate that mcnear removal from the detention center produce d an injury or harm,which is a fundamental requirement for demonstrating retaliation.see burlington northern,at.we thus find no error in the district court conclusion that mcnear retaliation claim was groundless.
other claims 
the employees also alleged that they were wrongfully terminated in violation of public policy and had suffered the intentional infliction of emotional distress.these claims are not developed on appeal.we therefore have no reason to address whether the district court erred in concluding that these claims were frivolous.see mcpherson kelsey,cir issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.it is not sufficient for a party to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to put flesh on its bones.quoting citizens awareness network,united states nuclear regulatory comm n,cir citation omitted.the district court conclusion that the these claims were frivolous will therefore not be disturbed.
joint and several liability 
a district court determination that plaintiffs are liable to pay attorney fees for bringing frivolous lawsuits,and the court calculation of the total amount owed,are actions that are reviewed on appeal under the standard.jordan city of cleveland,cir applying the standard of review to the district court application of the methodology.but the question of whether a district court has appropriately apportioned fees among multiple parties arguably raises a legal issue to be reviewed de novo.see turner bd.of elections and ethics,deciding the criteria for the apportionment of attorneys fees as a legal issue matter of petroleum,cir the question whether the harm is capable of apportionment among two or more causes is a question of law.citation omitted.we need not settle the question in this case,however,because we would reach the same conclusion regarding apportionment under either the or de novo standard of review.
the circuit decision in turner is instructive for the purposes of the present appeal.in turner,the appellate court held that where claims are centered on a set of common issues against jointly responsible parties,the district court should hold them jointly and severally liable for an award of attorney fees under.at.but where attorney fees derive from claims that are not in common to all of the responsible parties,such claims are not truly fractionable and fees should therefore be equitably apportioned among them.id.although turner involved the apportionment of fees against defendants instead of plaintiffs,we see no reason to limit its holding to that circumstance.we instead read turner to support the principle that,where multiple plaintiffs are liable for attorney fees under in the same proceeding,one plaintiff should not be required to pay for the attorney fees associated with defending against the claims of another plaintiff if the plaintiffs respective claims are factually unrelated.
the employees here all shared a claim involving common allegations about the ccjc employment practices.but this lone claim does not justify imposing the entire fee award jointly and severally among all of the employees in this case.most of the individual employees claims are in fact unrelated.the disparate treatment claims,for example,do not share a common factual nexus.and the retaliation claims similarly involved different allegations unique to each employee.indeed,the employees respective claims were sufficiently distinct that the district court decided to issue individual summary judgment orders against each one.
we therefore conclude that the district court erred in holding each employee jointly and severally liable with respect each other claims,as opposed to individually liable,for attorney fees under.the appropriate method of calculating attorney fees among the multiple employees will be addressed below.
calculation of attorney fees inability to pay 
calculating attorney fees under begins with determining the lodestar amount,which is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.hensley eckerhart,d.the district court calculation of the lodestar value,as well as any justifiable upward or downward departures,deserves substantial deference,but only when the court provides a clear and concise explanation of its reasons for the fee award.gonter hunt valve,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
on appeal,the appellants have not contested the district court basic lodestar calculation with respect to attorney fees under.instead,they argue that the ccjc had the burden to prove the employees ability to pay the attorney fees.they cite two unpublished cases in support of this proposition toombs,wl cir,and colton memorial drive trust,wl cir.the employees also contend that the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider their ability to of who had the burden of proof.see wolfe perry,cir holding that,under,that a nonprevailing plaintiff ability to pay may be used as a factor to determine the size of the award,but not whether an award is appropriate in the first place.
the appellants argument is without merit.as the district court noted,the above cases indicate that the party against whom sanctions are being sought has the burden to prove his or her inability to pay.see,wl,at the sanctioned plaintiff attempted to meet his burden of showing that he could not pay the costs that were demanded by filing a timely response to the defendants motion,in which he repeatedly asserted that he could not afford to pay the award.emphasis added colton,wl,at although ability to pay must be considered by a district court,inability to pay should be treated like an affirmative defense,with the burden upon the party being sanctioned to come forward with evidence of their financial status.quoting dodd ins,royal ins.of,cir.the employees have not identified any error in the district court legal analysis on this point.
we are nevertheless troubled by the district court failure to explain why the salary information provided to the court was insufficient to establish the employees inability to pay.in particular,the court itself recognized,in the portion of its order addressing costs,that the employees had modest incomes averaging about per year.we are therefore puzzled as to why this information was not addressed in the portion of the court order discussing the calculation of attorney fees.
our primary concern in an attorney fee case is that the fee awarded be reasonable.reed rhodes,cir.that concern is heightened in cases such as this,where attorney fees are assessed against losing plaintiffs in a civil rights action,because such an award is an extreme sanction,and must be limited to truly egregious cases of misconduct.jones cont l,cir emphasis added.although the district court undoubtedly has discretion in determining whether awarding attorney fees is appropriate,it nevertheless remains important for the district court to provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award.hensley,at.indeed,a t times,we have found an abuse of discretion where a district court fails to explain its reasoning adequately or to consider the competing arguments of the parties.geier sundquist,cir citing moore city of paducah,cir.
the district court obligation to explain its reasoning adequately exists irrespective of which party bears the burden of persuasion to demonstrate an inability to pay.as in any other context,absent some explication from the district court as to its reasoning on this particular issue,we can have no confidence that the district court properly analyzed the issue.without some discussion of the basis of the district court reasoning,meaningful appellate review is impossible.we conclude that the district court failure to address this salary information amounts to a failure to provide a clear and concise explanation of its reasons for the fee award,and we are therefore disinclined to give the degree of deference typically afforded to a district court calculations of fee award
