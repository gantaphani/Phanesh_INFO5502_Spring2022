the appellant,katherine wallace,appeals the lower court refusal to recuse itself in her case decision to award costs and attorneys fees against her pursuant to and adoption of the report by a magistrate judge acting as a special master recommending fees and costs of.we find no error with regard to the first two rulings but conclude that the district court erred regarding the third when it ignored the procedural requirements of.we therefore vacate that decision and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
background 
in,wallace was fired from her job as an associate in the washington,office of the law firm of skadden,arps,slate,meagher flom,llp skadden.she responded by suing the firm and some of its lawyers in superior court for defamation and wrongful discharge.as part of discovery in that suit,wallace subpoenaed several former skadden employees as witnesses.skadden offered to provide legal representation for those former employees,some of whom accepted.the superior court ultimately granted summary judgment to skadden.skadden provision of legal representation to its former employees led wallace to sue skadden,the witnesses and their lawyers and law firms participating in the superior court case the appellees here in federal court in august under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.c.wallace broadly alleged that the appellees conspired to control and withhold testimony in her superior court case citing bribery,obstruction of justice and witness tampering as the underlying predicate acts and sought million in damages.
in september,the appellees moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to.b.as part of that motion,they also moved for an award of attorneys fees and costs pursuant to because wallace claims were baseless and made in bad faith.joint appendix ja in response,wallace countered that her claims were legally and factually supported.regarding the request for attorneys fees,however,wallace merely suggested in the introduction and the conclusion of her brief that the appellees motion for costs and fees also be denied b ecause there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the appellees had violated rico.ja.almost one year later,in september,the district court dismissed wallace case pursuant to.b.it found inter alia that wallace rico claims were based solely on bare and conclusory allegations.ja.it further granted the appellees motion for costs and fees under,observing that wallace had offered no direct opposition to the motion and thus there was an uncontroverted record suggesting that wallace had engaged in this litigation out of bad faith.ja.
following that order,the district court set a schedule to determine the amount of costs and fees but wallace appealed the district court order.wallace subsequently voluntarily dismissed the portion of her appeal related to the district court decision to sanction her under and instead pursued only her appeal of the dismissal of her rico claims.in support of her appeal,wallace cited an ex parte communication between the district judge law clerk and counsel for one of the appellees,claiming that the contact contributed to an appearance of bias and misconduct on the part of the district court and required the district judge recusal.see appellees br.at.in may,we affirmed the district court without opinion,finding wallace rico allegations factually insufficient and no impropriety or evidence of judicial bias resulting from the ex parte contact with the district judge law clerk.ja.
again before the district court,the appellees sought a determination of the amount of their fee award.for her part,wallace disputed the court original decision to sanction her under and in january again moved to disqualify the district judge based on the prior ex parte communication.the district court denied her motion,noted that the issue whether to sanction her had been decided two years earlier and referred the determination of the appropriate amount to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.ja see b.a few weeks later,the court modified with the parties subsequent consent the original referral,appointing the magistrate judge to act as a special master.see b.
the magistrate judge initially referred the case for mediation but that proved unsuccessful.it then conducted,in july,an evidentiary hearing during which several appellees and their counsel as well as wallace testified.on january,the magistrate judge,acting as a special master,issued an report which concluded by suggest ing that wallace be ordered to pay.ja.the report was filed with the district court the following day.neither side filed objections to the report or made any motion with regard to it.
on february,the district court sua sponte adopted the special master report.ja.the court noted that wallace had filed no written objection to the report.invoking local civil rule b,the court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and ordered wallace to pay as a deterrent to future filing of frivolous legal actions.ja.
ii.discussion 
wallace first claim that the district judge should have recused herself need not occupy us long.to the extent that wallace seeks review of the district judge decision not to recuse on the basis of an appearance of impropriety,appellant br.at emphasis in original,she asserted as much on her first appeal.see appellees br.at including wallace original appellate brief which alleged actual or apparent impropriety.we concluded then that there was no impropriety or evidence of judicial bias on the district judge part with regard to the ex parte communication with her law clerk.ja.we can not consider this claim anew.united states alaw,law of case doctrine bars review of claims decided in earlier appeal.
wallace second claim is equally unavailing.we review the district court decision to sanction a party pursuant to for abuse of discretion.laprade kidder peabody.wallace argues that we should reverse the district court sanction because her rico claims were colorable and brought in good faith and because the district court failed to make findings sufficient to meet the requirements of due process.appellant br.at.but wallace failed to oppose the appellees original sanctions motion in district court.in an earlier case,we declined to consider a claim that a district court abused its discretion,or did not adequately support its decision with findings of fact,in imposing sanctions pursuant to.because the appellant failed to oppose the motion in district court.see geller randi.here skadden section motion made in conjunction with its motion to dismiss specifically sought costs and attorneys fees based not only on the baselessness of wallace rico claims but also on her bad faith in pursuing them including,among other things,the fact that wallace sent copies of her complaint to local judges,the media,other lawyers and the independent counsel investigating president clinton.see ja.wallace responded to that motion by focusing exclusively on the sufficiency of her rico claims pursuant to rule b she only cursorily referenced the section motion in the introduction and the conclusion of her brief and completely failed to respond to the bad faith allegations.in granting the section motion,the district court stated that wallace rico claims utterly lack ed merit and that the uncontroverted record suggest ed that wallace has engaged in this litigation out of bad faith.ja emphasis added.we find no reason to allow wallace to challenge the district court decision for the first time on appeal 
we do find error,however,in the district court adoption of the report of the magistrate judge acting as a special master.although the initial referral to the magistrate judge was pursuant to b,wallace skadden,see.the district court,with the parties consent,modified that referral and specified the magistrate judge as a special master pursuant to.see wallace skadden,march,noting the court intention that the previous referral to the magistrate judge be converted into an appointment of the magistrate judge as a special master,pursuant to b,and local civil rule b wallace skadden,noting parties consent to having this matter r
