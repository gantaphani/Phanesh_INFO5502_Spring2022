plaintiff bernard olcott,an investor in oil drilling and exploration limited partnerships,filed a complaint against defendants in alleging federal securities law violations and various state law tort,fraud and breach of contract claims the claims arose out of defendants solicitation,sale and operation of oil tax shelter limited partnership units between and.plaintiff suit sought damages and rescission of the investment contracts.in february,after unsuccessfully attempting to employ more traditional discovery motions,plaintiff filed a motion to compel defendants to render an accounting of all partnership assets and income.on march,in exchange for the court postponement of the jury trial scheduled to begin march,defendants consented to entry of an accounting order requiring them to provide plaintiff within six months a full,complete,meaningful,and formal accounting setting forth all items of contribution,income,and expense as well as the disposition of all assets and monies 
defendants subsequently submitted three accountings.after each submission,plaintiff challenged the sufficiency of the accounting.the accounting expert also found each of the submitted accountings wholly inadequate.the court held an evidentiary hearing after each submission and,after each hearing,concluded the submitted accounting did not comply with the court accounting orders.after each hearing,the court ordered defendants to file a supplemental accounting.
after the third submission,and a delay of almost four years,the court concluded defendants failure to comply was willful and in bad faith.the court partially based its conclusion on the testimony of two of defendant michael galesi former attorneys.each testified galesi agreed to provide an accounting solely to obtain a continuance and never had any intention of complying with the court accounting order.counsel also testified that galesi still had no intention of complying with the court order and would rather take his chances than provide the accounting.plaintiff also introduced evidence that none of defendants had requested bank records or made any other effort to produce an accounting in compliance with the court order.as a result of the willful discovery violations,the court entered an order of default on february.see.b.a.in its order,the court stated 
this court must order a sanction appropriate to the severity of defendants abuse of the legal process.plaintiff is entitled to a judgment against the defendants,jointly and severally,for his investment of million less any portion of those funds which defendants can establish were utilized for legitimate purposes under the terms and provisions of the limited partnership agreements.there will be a trial at which the burden will be on the defendants to establish to the satisfaction of the fact finder that any portion of plaintiff contribution was utilized for legitimate business purposes under the terms of the agreements among the parties 
the court also ordered defendants to comply with its prior accounting order by correcting the deficiencies identified by the court expert.
following the court entry of default,defendants filed a summary judgment motion asserting the statute of limitations barred plaintiff federal securities act claims.the district court ultimately dismissed plaintiff federal claims on statute of limitations grounds the court also dismissed plaintiff state law claims,concluding that it did not have jurisdiction after dismissing the federal claims.in the same order,without referring to its prior entry of default,the court sanctioned defendants for their failure to comply with discovery orders by ordering defendants to pay in attorneys fees and accounting expenses.plaintiff appealed the dismissal of his federal and state claims and sought enforcement of the order entering default.defendants the imposition of the monetary sanction.
on appeal,this court affirmed dismissal of plaintiff federal securities act claims with respect to the,and partnership interests,but reversed and remanded for reconsideration the district court dismissal of the securities act claims and all pendant state law claims.olcott ii,remanding plaintiff securities act claims for further factual findings and remanding plaintiff pendant state claims with instructions to conduct the appropriate death knell analysis.olcott ii also affirmed the district court imposition of the monetary sanction,but declined to rule upon the merits of the default order after concluding the court entry of default was not a final determination.id.at.in olcott ii,we assumed the district court intended to abandon its entry of default when it entered an order dismissing all claims without entering judgment on the default pursuant to.b.id.olcott ii expressly instructed the district court that it could revisit the issue on remand if the court ultimately revives olcott cause of action based on his investment,the court could take the opportunity to revisit the appropriateness of a default judgment at that time.id.at.
on remand,the district court again dismissed as time barred the federal securities claims based on plaintiff investment,but elected to retain pendant jurisdiction over plaintiff state law tort,fraud and breach of contract claims.the court also indicated its intent to apply the default entered prior to the appeal.at a january conference,the court specifically ruled that plaintiff remaining claims would merge into the default,stating i further find and order that plaintiff remaining claims merged into the million dollar judgment entered by this court.
in a february,order,the district court dismissed many of plaintiff state law claims.the court also ruled plaintiff remaining fraud and breach of contract claims would not be tried during the hearing 
the primary issue raised by the motions for summary judgment is whether plaintiff is entitled to pursue his state law claims and receive the benefit of the million default judgment he has previously been awarded.plaintiff has stated both at the preliminary trial conference and at status conferences,that he wishes to accept the million default judgment,but that he wishes also to be able to put on evidence for his fraud case as well.plaintiff concedes that damages are the same,but argues that proving the fraud case is necessary because he may incur problems proving his case if the default judgment is ultimately reversed.this is not sufficient reason to allow plaintiff to put on evidence to prove a fraud claim when plaintiff has already received a judgment in his favor entitling him to the same damages.in the interest of efficiency and judicial economy,the trial of this matter is limited to the issues encompassed by the default judgment previously entered.
the court conducted a hearing to establish and quantify defendants entitlement to credits against the default.defendants had the burden of establishing their entitlement to credits by producing an accounting that complied with the court prior accounting orders.the court limited its consideration of defendants evidence to accounting materials directly tracing defendants use of plaintiff funds.the court did not permit plaintiff to put on evidence related to his fraud or contract claims.
on june,after a hearing,the court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff in the amount of plus interest.the court specifically found defendants failed to cure the deficiencies in the accounting.with the exception of certain credits,the court ruled defendants failed to establish entitlement to any credits against the default.the court subsequently entered an order quantifying the prejudgment interest award and awarding attorneys fees and costs.
in this appeal,defendants first assert the district court was without jurisdiction to conduct a hearing or to enter the final judgment order because the court had previously dismissed all substantive claims.whether the district court had jurisdiction is a legal question we review de novo.kunkel continental casualty,cir.
in its order,the district court summarized its prior ruling limiting the hearing to issues encompassed by the order entering default 
the court further held in its february,order that in the interest of efficiency and judicial economy the trial of this matter is limited to the issues encompassed by the default judgment previously awarded by the february,order.hence,plaintiff claims for common law fraud,breach of contract,rescission,negligence,mismanagement,malfeasance,misfeasance,partnership waste,breach of fiduciary duties and interference with business and investment objectives,were dismissed.
emphasis added.defendants rely on this single statement in the order to argue the district court dismissed plaintiff state law fraud and contract claims.the district court description of its prior ruling was an unfortunate misstatement.the february,order clearly did not dismiss plaintiff fraud and breach of contract claims.instead,the order noted that these claims were still viable but that,in the interest of judicial economy,plaintiff would not be allowed to put on evidence to prove a fraud claim when plaintiff has already received a judgment in his favor entitling him to the same damages.the district court never dismissed plaintiff fraud and breach of contract claims.
reading the order as a whole clarifies that in the interest of efficiency and judicial economy the district court merged these claims into the default order,in effect placing all substantive matters on hold pending resolution of the default order the order states that jurisdiction is predicated on the claims defendants allege the court dismissed jurisdiction is predicated upon the may,order of the court,wherein this court ruled that this court would retain jurisdiction over plaintiff pendant state claims.the order also notes although olcott would be willing to accept a final default judgment for the amount of his investment plus interest less his actual return on investment,he has not consented to forego his breach of contract and fraud claims emphasis in the original.
in transcripts of hearings,the court also repeatedly notes that plaintiff claims were merged into the default rather than dismissed.at a january conference,the court specifically ruled that plaintiff remaining claims had merged into the default judgment i further find and order that the contract claims of plaintiff merged into the million dollar judgment entered by this court.during the august,pretrial conference,at which the parties reviewed the pretrial order in question,the district court repeatedly reaffirmed the merger of plaintiff breach of contract and fraud claims into the sanction judgment this is not a contract case.the contract case and the fraud case merged into the court million judgment.
at the hearing,the district court instructed counsel that plaintiff fraud claims would be addressed,if necessary,following the court resolution of the default judgment proceedings.finally,in its june,judgment order,the court stated 
on remand from the appellate court this court granted summary judgment on a number of claims and held that the remaining claims merged into the million default judgment award entered in.
emphasis added.despite the misstatement in the order,the parties were well aware that plaintiff state law fraud and breach of contract claims remained viable.the record does not support defendants argument that the district court dismissed these claims 
even if we assume the district court dismissed all substantive claims after entering the order of default,the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the sanction.defendants argue that constitutional limits on subject matter jurisdiction restrict the district court authority to enforce a sanction after dismissing all substantive claims.see const.art iii.article iii limits the federal courts subject matter jurisdiction to specifically defined cases and controversies.id.accordingly,article iii limits a federal court authority to impose and enforce sanctions when the case or controversy at issue is not properly before the federal courts.see hernandez conriv realty,cir holding where federal subject matter jurisdiction does not exist,federal courts do not have the power to dismiss with prejudice,even as a procedural sanction.ray eyster in re orthopedic bone screw prods.liability litig,cir same.but see allen exxon in re the exxon valdez,cir default judgment imposed as discovery sanction is enforceable even if it is later determined the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.if a case or controversy is properly before the federal courts,however,article iii restriction on federal courts subject matter jurisdiction is not implicated.see willy coastal,d discussing article limits on court ability to impose sanctions where court never had subject matter jurisdiction 
plaintiff complaint asserted federal securities act claims and pendant state law claims.the district court had original subject matter jurisdiction over the federal claims pursuant to and over the state claims pursuant to a.dismissal of a properly pled federal claim does not retroactively deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction.see bell hood.federal jurisdiction is not defeated by the possibility that complaint fails to state a cause of action on which a plaintiff could actually recover.nor does the court dismissal of all substantive claims deprive the court of authority to enforce a previously entered sanction.a district court retains jurisdiction to impose and enforce sanctions until the court enters a final judgment see.b any order that fails to adjudicate all rights and liabilities does not terminate the action.see also limiting appellate jurisdiction,which divests district court of jurisdiction over matters connected to the appeal,to final decisions of the district court.district court proceedings are not final until the district court has rendered a decision that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.see copeland,at.this matter was not final until the district court entered its final judgment order quantifying plaintiff damage award following the hearing.the february,order,which defendants allege dismissed plaintiff remaining substantive claims,expressly contemplates further proceedings before the district court.accordingly,the order did not constitute a final decision and did not divest the district court of jurisdiction to enforce the sanction.
in sum,the record does not support defendants argument that the district court dismissed all of plaintiff substantive claims.but even assuming the district court inadvertently dismissed all substantive claims after entering default,the court expressly retained jurisdiction to enforce the sanction.the district court proceedings were not final,and the court had jurisdiction to enforce its prior sanction.
defendants next assert the district court violated their constitutional right to a jury trial.the district court determined that the hearing,limited to ascertaining defendants compliance with court discovery orders,required resolution of equitable rather than legal issues.accordingly,the court concluded defendants did not have a right to a jury and ruled that the hearing would be tried before the bench.defendants assert they were entitled to a jury pursuant to.b and the seventh amendment of the constitution.following the entry of default,fed civ.b authorizes the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the amount of damages.the rule does not contain an inherent jury requirement,but preserves the right to a jury when and as required by any statute of the united states.defendants assert the seventh amendment provides the right to a jury because plaintiff complaint sought money damages
