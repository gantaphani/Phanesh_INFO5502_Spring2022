on july,the government filed a second superceding indictment against richard joseph finley charging him with one count of making a false claim against the united states in violation of,one count of attempting to interfere with the administration of the internal revenue service in violation of a,and three counts of bank fraud in violation of.
a jury trial began on december.in the middle of the defendant presentation of his expert psychological witness,the government objected to the witness testimony and requested that the testimony be struck as a sanction for the defendant violation of federal rule of criminal procedure b c.after lengthy discussions outside the presence of the jury and after the district court conducted a hearing pursuant to daubert merrell dow,d,the district court excluded the entirety of defense expert testimony as a sanction for violation of rule and as unreliable and irrelevant under federal rule of evidence.
on january,the jury returned guilty verdicts on all but one bank fraud count.the court dismissed the one remaining bank fraud count based upon the jury inability to reach a verdict.
finley appeals his conviction and sentence of imprisonment.finley raises the sole issue of whether the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the entirety of his psychological expert testimony.
we reverse and remand on this record determining that the trial court erred in striking all expert testimony presented by finley that corroborated his defense.
background 
finley owned a law bookstore and ran a bar review course for students of law schools.in,finley began looking for investors to assist him in opening a chain of approximately twenty bookstores across the united states.finley could not obtain traditional bank financing because of a dispute he had with the irs over a large tax claim.
in november,a customer mentioned that he had attended an investment seminar in montana run by leroy schweitzer inspired by this suggestion,on december,finley went to schweitzer farmhouse in rural montana to attend the investment seminar.schweitzer explained that he possessed recorded liens against norwest bank of montana,other banks,and individuals,and that he could draw on these accounts by issuing negotiable instruments.
at the conclusion of the seminar,each attendee received a audience with schweitzer to explain the attendee needs.when he met with schweitzer,finley explained his business plan to open a chain of bookstores.finley also told schweitzer that he owed the irs about and that he owed a mortgage on his condominium with great western bank.
schweitzer gave finley several documents that looked like financial instruments and were entitled,comptroller warrants and certified banker checks.schweitzer made one document payable to finley and the bank of america for,finley estimate of the cost of starting his bookstore chain.schweitzer made the second document out to finley and great western bank for,or about twice the remaining amount finley owed on his mortgage.the third instrument named the irs and finley as payees for,twice the amount finley owed in taxes.although nothing existed in writing,finley understood that schweitzer would receive percent of the profits from the bookstores.
finley returned to sacramento,california with the documents and prepared to open his new bookstores.he attempted to deposit the million document with the bank of america in late december and again in august.finley gave the bank of america document to an officer who had handled finley business accounts for several years.the bank began processing the instrument,but it was returned marked fictitious check with a separate notice that indicated please resubmit when corrections are made.appellant br.the bank also contacted the post office and received a fraud alert addressing similar instruments from schweitzer.the bank gave a copy of the alert to finley.nonetheless,finley attempted to negotiate the instrument a second time in august.this time finley told the bank to send it to a designated address,but the item came back unpaid again.
similarly,on january,finley attempted to use the document to pay off his real estate mortgage with great western bank.finley included a note indicating the failure to refund the excess amount would constitute criminal conversion.great western did not negotiate the instrument because the bank had prior knowledge of fraud alerts regarding schweitzer instruments 
on january,the chief of the fraud section of the office of the comptroller of the currency wrote finley stating that the schweitzer document was not a valid obligation of the federal government the special account number is not an account for redemption of payment of such an instrument the format is not one used by the federal government and advised finley to contact the fbi.appellant br.
undeterred by this information,finley mailed the document to the irs center in ogden,utah on january.finley included a letter requesting immediate refund for overpayment in the amount of.the irs did not credit the amount to finley balance because of its prior knowledge of schweitzer instruments.the irs had received more than two hundred requests for refunds totaling and irs workers knew that no refunds should be issued finley submitted the irs document on a total of three separate occasions.
after determining that the irs and the banks would not honor his documents,finley embarked on an quest to learn why the government agencies would not honor what he believed to be valid financial instruments.finley contacted in person or via mail,facsimile,or telephone several state and federal agencies in an attempt to learn how to negotiate the instruments.every response indicated that the instruments were the subject of a fraud alert,deemed without value,and should not be honored.
in,finley prepared a media packet detailing his efforts to cash the instruments.he entitled the document robin hood and the hoods and portrayed various government officials as bad guys for not cashing the documents.appellant br.he distributed this packet to numerous network news programs and national newspapers.no media responded to his packets.
in april,the fbi arrested schweitzer and others,but not finley,on multiple charges of fraud based on schweitzer seminars and instruments.around this time,finley ceased his pursuit to have the instruments honored.
in june,finley testified at schweitzer trial in montana.in his testimony he stated that the government had not prosecuted him for attempting to cash the instruments.this trial resulted in a hung jury.prior to his testifying in the second trial of schweitzer in october,the government notified finley that it would indict him.a grand jury formally indicted finley on november.
trial proceedings 
on august,finley counsel filed a notice under.b,informing the government that it intended to introduce testimony relating to a mental disease or defect or any other mental condition relevant to guilt.the government made a discovery request for information about the expert testimony.in response,on october,finley attorney sent a letter to the government summarizing the expert opinions of john wicks.wicks,a licensed clinical psychologist in california,had examined finley.this letter represented that finley has an atypical belief system,a system which is very rigid.the letter also stated,while finley presents some indications of shared psychotic disorder folie a deux,wicks does not at present make that diagnosis.finley is not suffering under any mental condition which is reported in the.
in a second letter dated october,finley counsel once again represented their intent to call wicks at trial.in pertinent part,that letter reads 
finley mental condition,as set forth by wicks,will be presented at trial to show that finley did not have the intent to defraud,the requisite mens rea for the crime.the case of united states rahm,cir contains a very similar fact pattern and is legal authority for the admission of the evidence.i have attached a copy of the opinion for your convenience.
thereafter,the prosecution moved under.to preclude finley from relying on expert mental health testimony at the trial.at the hearing on the motion,neither party sought an examination of the psychologist to qualify that testimony under the kumho requirements.the government contention was that.b barred the testimony because it addressed an value system.
the court ruled that wicks testimony would be admissible and expressed its understanding that wicks could not testify about any element of the crime charged.the court then advised counsel 
then i think the way to handle it is to be careful on examination and to make appropriate objections,mckeon the prosecutor.if a question is asked that you feel calls for wicks to express an opinion about finley actual belief or the sincerity of those beliefs,you may object.and then if he blurts it out,move to strike,and i strike it.
additionally,the court instructed finley counsel to meet with wicks to make it clear to him the areas that he not supposed to go into s o he has to stay within the bounds of the court ruling on what relevant.
the parties proceeded to trial and the defense called wicks.wicks explained his thirty years of experience in psychology including his extensive experience in conducting psychological evaluations of patients.he stated that he spent two days with finley,including administering a battery of psychological tests and interviewing him.as a result of the tests and examination,wicks testified that finley has an atypical belief system.wicks explained that most people have an open belief system which is subject to change,but some people have closed belief systems.closed belief systems are more abnormal because they are fixed and rigid.wicks then testified how an atypical belief system operates.wicks testified 
it a closed belief system in which information from the real world that comes in is so grossly distorted that the person ends up with a belief system that the average person in the culture just simply would sit back and say,huh how can you believe that if x,y,and z does fit with that,they would then come up with an explanation how x,y,and z fit just fine with their belief system.
wicks explained that a delusion is another psychological term for an atypical belief system and he stated there are three major categories of delusions.wicks opined that finley was vulnerable to a delusional disorder in december,stating he tends to hear what he wants to hear and believe what he wants to believe about someone.so this had happened even prior to.the doctor concluded that finley suffered from a delusional disorder from a minimum of until the present.he elaborated that a person with a delusional disorder can be dissuaded from the delusion o nly with tremendous,tremendous difficulty.
at this point,the government objected to wicks testimony and moved to strike it as a discovery violation.after extensive discussion with counsel for both parties,the court expressed the view that defense counsel had sandbagged the prosecutor and the court.then the court decided to conduct a daubert hearing that afternoon before proceeding with trial.
at that hearing,wicks explained his methodology and stated the psychological community accepted the methodology he used.that methodology included a history of the patient,consisting of family,vocational,educational,medical and legal histories,the observation of the patient behavior,and the administration of standard psychological tests.he stated he did not diagnose finley as having a delusional disorder,although finley symptoms did fit within many of its criteria.he explained his fear that such a diagnosis might have suggested that finley was legally incompetent,whereas wicks believed finley could assist counsel and understood his legal proceedings.this left wicks with a diagnosis of an atypical belief system.
wicks indicated that finley psychological tests were consistent with a diagnosis of a delusional disorder.wicks explained that finley million clinical multiaxial inventory indicated that he had a high level of narcissism,a trait of a delusional person.the test also showed an elevated anxiety scale and a mild level of depression.wicks explained how he used these tests to rule out other psychological disorders including schizophrenia,manic depression,and psychosis.
at the conclusion of the daubert hearing,the district court ruled from the bench.the court excluded the testimony on two grounds.it indicated that either ground was sufficient to exclude the testimony.first,under.the court ruled that the testimony would not be helpful to the jury.the court indicated that the jury could independently determine finley credibility.the second ground for excluding the evidence struck the testimony as a sanction for a.b c violation.
ii.standard of review 
we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision to admit or exclude scientific evidence.general joiner,d.a court abuses its discretion when it bases its decision on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous view of the facts.united states morales,cir en banc.under the abuse of discretion standard,we reverse where we have a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment.united states,cir.however,a trial court has broad discretion in assessing the relevance and reliability of expert testimony.united states murillo,cir.
we review the interpretation of a discovery rule meaning de novo.see united states peters,cir.we review for abuse of discretion the propriety of excluding the evidence as a sanction when the rule has been violated.id.
iii.discussion 
the district court excluded wicks testimony as inadmissable under.and as a sanction under.b c.the court indicated that it believed either ground was sufficient to exclude the testimony.therefore,we must evaluate the admissibility of the proffered evidence under both rules we will first consider the reliability and relevance of wicks expert testimony under rules and b,then we will consider the trial court exclusion of the testimony as a rule sanction.
exclusion of wicks expert testimony as unreliable and irrelevant 
federal rule of evidence governs the admissibility of expert opinion testimony.the rule consists of three distinct but related requirements the subject matter at issue must be beyond the common knowledge of the average layman the witness must have sufficient expertise and the state of the pertinent art or scientific knowledge permits the assertion of a reasonable opinion.morales,at.
our rule analysis is guided by relevant supreme court precedent.see,at explaining how the daubert court set out factors to be reviewed when applying rule.in daubert,the supreme court charged trial judges with the responsibility of acting as to ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant,but reliable.at.the court articulated a inquiry for determining whether scientific evidence or testimony is admissible.first,the trial court must make a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.id.at.the court cautioned that the trial court must focus on the principles and methodology,not on the conclusions that they generate.id.at.second,the court must ensure that the proposed expert testimony is relevant and will serve to aid the trier of fact.id.at.expert testimony assists the trier of fact when it provides information beyond the common knowledge of the trier of fact.id.at.the court,in kumho tire,clarified that the district court gatekeeper function applies to all expert testimony,not just testimony based in science.see at.
the government does not contest that wicks possesses the qualifications to testify as an expert under rule.the district court acknowledged that wicks qualifies as an expert in his field.the main issues of contention between the parties center on whether wicks methodology is reliable and whether his testimony will assist the jury.in resolving this issue we will rely on the pertinent federal rules of evidence,daubert,kumho tire,and this circuit case law.
reliability wicks methodology 
at the conclusion of the daubert hearing,the district court made several observations about wicks reasoning and methodology.initially,it concluded 
wicks methodology is itself nothing unusual.the methodology itself is the form that is used by medical doctors uniformly.he considers the history given by the patient,his observations clinically of the patient behavior,and any psychological testing i have no doubt that his psychological tests are well established tests that are widely accepted in the medical and psychological community.
however after making these general observations,the court went on to identify what it considered to be several problems with the reliability of wicks opinion.the court seemed troubled by the fact that the psychological tests did not reveal a conclusive diagnosis.the court recognized that wicks diagnosis was not inconsistent with the psychological tests,but said,the results are not inconsistent with a lot of other things.the court also asserted that wicks based his opinion on his belief that finley was not faking or being deceptive 
when you strip his opinion down to what it really seems to be based on,mckeon is correct.it based on the assumption that what he saying in his history and what he tells to wicks is true.it relies upon the assumption that he is being truthful when he says what his views are 
in its brief,the government extrapolates from the district court position and argues that wicks opinion is not reliable because it depends entirely on the doctor subjective assessment of finley truthfulness.appellee br.the government also contends that wicks methodology is deficient under rule because he based his conclusions on facts that were merely commonsensical or beyond the scope of his expertise 
it appears from the record before us that wicks based his diagnosis on proper psychological methodology and reasoning.he relied on accepted psychological tests,from which he drew sound inferences,and he took a thorough patient history,including meeting with finley wife and observing finley behavior.wicks did not base his conclusions solely on finley statements rather,he used his many years of experience and training to diagnose finley mental condition.finally,wicks did not use any experimental techniques in his evaluation of finley and he did not deviate in any way from his normal practice of conducting psychological evaluations.thus,we reject the government argument.
the government argues wicks diagnosis is unreliable because it is based on the fact that wicks believed that finley was not deceiving him.the government cites several cases that it alleges support the argument that wicks opinion is founded on accepting finley truthfulness rather than on sound psychological methodology.see united states charley,cir united states whitted,cir united states benson,cir and viterbo dow chem,cir.none of these cases is apposite.
neither charley nor whitted supports the government position because both cases involve a medical doctor testimony about the truth of a child victim report of sexual abuse.in both cases,the truth of the victim report was the very substance of the doctor testimony.the government acknowledges in its brief that finley truthfulness is not the substance of wicks opinion.appellee br.the government instead contends that wicks founded his opinion on finley truthfulness.again,however,the facts of this case and the case law offered do not support the government position.
in charley and whitted,medical doctors called as experts testified to their opinions that children were abused based primarily on the statements of the children that they were abused.charley,at describing opinions as based largely on witness statements whitted,at describing opinions as based solely on witness statements.thus,in each of those cases,the expert was merely reciting the allegation of the alleged victim in the guise of a medical opinion,whitted,at,which does nothing but vouch for the credibility of another witness,and therefore does not assist the trier of fact as required by rule.charley,at.in addition,each court noted that the fact of whether the alleged abuse occurred was for the jury to decide and therefore the expert testimony was usurping the role of the jury as the ultimate fact finder.see charley,at whitted,at.
unlike the experts in charley and whitted,wicks did not merely recite finley statements to the jury in the guise of a medical opinion.wicks did not base his diagnosis of finley on finley own conclusion that he had a mental impairment the way the doctors in charley and whitted based their diagnosis of the existence of abuse on the witnesses statements that they were abused.
nor did wicks diagnosis of finley usurp the role of the jury with regard to an ultimate issue of fact.the jury needed to decide whether finley knew the financial instruments were fake,not whether he had a mental impairment that might inhibit him from reaching the conclusion that the instruments were fake.the jury could accept wicks diagnosis and still find that finley knew the instruments to be fraudulent.neither whitted nor charley stands for the proposition the government would have it support that a psychologist can not provide expert testimony about his diagnosis of a mental disorder based on a variety of factors,including the statements made by the defendant to the psychologist in the course of his examination.
likewise,benson,and viterbo,do not support the government argument and are inapplicable to the facts of this case.in benson,the seventh circuit found an abuse of discretion where the trial court allowed the government to introduce the testimony of an internal revenue service agent whose purpose was to summarize the government case and give his expert opinion on whether the defendant was required to file income tax returns.the court concluded that much of the agent testimony consisted of nothing more than drawing inferences from the evidence that he was no more qualified than the jury to draw and the agent relied on testimony from other witnesses whose credibility was vigorously attacked by the defendant.at.specifically,the court noted that the agent had no special skill or knowledge that would allow him to credit the truthfulness of the other witnesses.id.as we have outlined,wicks based his psychological analysis of finley on more than a summary of finley statements,and he was eminently more qualified than a layperson on the jury to assess the significance of facts such as finley adamant refusal to accept,or even consider,the government plea offer 
viterbo also is distinguishable from the present case.in viterbo,the fifth circuit upheld the exclusion of the expert opinion of a medical doctor as lacking a reliable foundation because the doctor did not perform a proper medical history of the patient prior to developing his opinion.there,the medical expert sought to attribute the plaintiff depression and other ailments to his exposure to a chemical based only on the plaintiff statements that he experienced the symptoms and exposure to the chemical was the only possible cause.at.the fifth circuit upheld the exclusion of that testimony because the doctor was not aware that viterbo had a family history of depression and hypertension that could have explained the source of the symptoms.id.at concluding that the failure to take into account this history seriously weakens the reliability of the patient oral history as a foundation for the doctor expert opinion.it is not clear that wicks made a similar error in diagnosing finley.the trial record reveals that wicks opinion is based on more than simply crediting finley statements.wicks administered psychological tests to rule out serious mental disorders,he took a case history and interviewed finley spouse to ascertain additional information,and he observed finley physical movements and conducted a physical exam to determine if there was a possible physiological problem.the government has not argued that wicks opinion is based on an inaccurate history or is lacking in any specific facts.
we also reject the government argument because wicks provided articulable reasons why he believed finley was not being deceptive or faking.at the daubert hearing,wicks explained that there was no indication that he finley was being deceitful on what probably amounted to four or five hours of testing.wicks had previously explained how the psychological tests were specifically designed to detect someone who is trying to fake a mental illness.in addition,wicks noted that finley responses were internally consistent,and wicks had not identified any defensiveness in finley or any indication that he was his symptoms.based on his clinical experience and these facts,wicks concluded that finley was not faking or lying 
a belief,supported by sound reasoning,that the patient is not faking or lying is sufficient to support the reliability of a mental health diagnosis.in a different factual context,we have stated that the law does not require every expert who testifies to be an expert in detecting deceit.united states morales,cir reversing a district court exclusion of defendant bookkeeping expert who the district court excluded because the defendant may have intentionally deceived the expert about her true knowledge of bookkeeping principles.analogously,we refuse to require that mental health experts prove themselves infallible lie detectors before accepting their psychological diagnoses.
the government next seeks to convince us that wicks diagnosis is unreliable because he based his conclusions on matters beyond his expertise.the doctor was initially hesitant to apply the delusional disorder terminology of the based on his fear that using certain terms would cause the court to question finley legal competence 
in testimony before the jury prior to the government objection,wicks explained that a closed belief system,which distorts or rejects information that does not comport with certain beliefs,is called atypical belief system.this system can also be referred to by the term delusion.wicks then explained that there are three major categories of delusions bizarre delusions held by schizophrenics atypical delusions held by people who function very normally in everyday life unless you touch their delusions and shared delusional systems known as folie a deux.wicks did not classify finley in any of these categories.he was interrupted by the government objection shortly after presenting these three categories.
at the daubert hearing,wicks elaborated on how he diagnosed finley as having an atypical belief system.he admitted that it was an extremely gray diagnosis and he could have easily given him a diagnosis of a delusional disorder but that would have raised the question as to his competency in federal court when wicks believed that finley was capable of assisting his attorney and understanding the court proceedings.wicks explained his choice of terminology by saying that an atypical belief system is a personality description,not a diagnosis.nonetheless,wicks believed that finley mental condition could fit the criteria for a delusional disorder under the.
we determine that wicks diagnosis should not be deemed unreliable based on his choice of terminology to describe the diagnosis.wicks adequately explained his method of diagnosis to overcome any doubt that he was misdiagnosing finley or intentionally misleading the government or the court.according to wicks testimony,the symptoms finley exhibited could be described as either a delusional disorder or atypical belief system.wicks simply chose the term,in his view,with the least potential for confusion.we have recognized that concepts of mental disorders are conception s about which the psychological and psychiatric community is far from unanimous and a district court may not exclude proffered expert psychological testimony simply because the defendant condition does not fit within the expert or the district court of mental disorder.united states rahm,cir reversing the district court exclusion of expert testimony that the defendant had perceptual difficulties making it impossible for her to recognize counterfeit currency.
we conclude that the district court erred in assessing the reliability of wicks testimony.wicks did not base his opinions solely on the truthfulness of finley statement nor does the record before us demonstrate that the diagnosis was reached through unsound methodology or reasoning.it appears from the record that wicks diagnosis incorporates testing,case history,interviews with the patient and family,medical factors and expert experience applying the information contained in the and other mental health publications.wicks experience with evaluating thousands of people should not be undervalued.
relevance assist the trier of fact 
the district court concluded that wicks testimony was not relevant because the jury could make its own determination about the sincerity and veracity of finley beliefs,the jury could also make the same observations wicks made,and,the government could not effectively the expert diagnosis the government makes a similar argument to this court,contending that wicks testimony does not assist the trier of fact because it does not exceed the common knowledge of the trier of fact and crediting wicks testimony precludes the jury from finding that finley possessed the necessary mens rea for the crime 
common knowledge of the trier of fact 
we reject the government first argument and hold that the district court abused its discretion when it found that wicks expert opinion did not exceed the common knowledge of the average layperson.
we must be cautious not to overstate the scope of the average juror common understanding and knowledge.as the seventh circuit has recognized,it is precisely because juries are unlikely to know that social scientists and psychologists have identified such a personality disorder that the testimony would have assisted the jury in making its decision.united states hall,cir.
jurors are unlikely to know that psychologists have identified a personality disorder that explains why a seemingly normal person could reject or distort certain overwhelmingly true information.wicks testimony would have offered an explanation as to how an otherwise normal man could believe that these financial instruments were valid and reject all evidence to the contrary.while finley could and did testify about how and why he believed the instruments were valid,only a trained mental health expert could provide a counterweight to the government allegations against finley.on the basis of the record before us,finley was entitled to present wicks testimony to support his defense theory.
our case law recognizes the importance of expert testimony when an issue appears to be within the parameters of a layperson common sense,but in actuality,is beyond their knowledge.in united states vallejo,cir,we reversed a trial court decision to exclude a school psychologist testimony that special education students whose first language is not english have difficulties communicating in english in high pressure situations.even though this testimony was seemingly based on common sense,we stated that the expert testimony was necessary to explain how the defendant and an interrogating officer could have very different perceptions of what occurred during the interrogation,yet could both be correct from a communications standpoint.at.in vallejo,we relied on the logic of a first circuit case in which the court explained t he expert testimony was needed to explain why the defendant would make false statements even though they were inconsistent with his apparent when c ommon understanding conforms to the notion that a person ordinarily does not make untruthful inculpatory statements.id.at quoting united states shay,cir concluding that the defendant should have been allowed to present expert testimony that he suffered from a mental disorder which caused him to tell grandiose,lies.the first circuit reformulated the proper rule inquiry to be w hether the untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best degree,the particular issue without enlightenment from those having a specialized understanding of the subject matter involved.shay,at citations omitted.in the instant case,the average layperson was not qualified to assess finley mental condition without the assistance of an expert specialized understanding.
the district court also concluded that several factors in wicks diagnosis,including the elevated levels of narcissism and wicks observations of finley physical conduct,are the kinds of observations a jury is supposed to make.we reject the notion that the jury could make the same observations as wicks about finley physical demeanor and his psychological test scores.first,we note the obvious distinction between a mental health professional examining a patient in private and a jury observing a defendant testifying on the witness stand.second,while the jury members might have been able to visually identify finley demeanor,they were not trained to interpret and assess those observations the government describes these as commonsensical observations about finley demeanor,but wicks was able to carefully detail his expert ability to recognize certain symptoms based on his training and years of experience we doubt the members of the jury possess such an ability.finally,as wicks explained,interpreting psychological testing scores requires years of experience and training.providing the jury with this raw information would simply not have been enough.
the court also excluded wicks opinion because there nothing that anybody can get their teeth into if you want to him.contrary to this position and as previously mentioned in note of this opinion,all of the weaknesses the district court noted in wicks testimony,including the subjectivity of his conclusions and his reliance on the veracity of finley statements,can be properly addressed by the government on.see,rahm,at any deficits in the psychologist qualifications beyond her professional training go to the weight of her testimony rather than to its admissibility.vigorous,presentation of contrary evidence,and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.daubert,at.we note that even with the short notice the government effectively wicks during the daubert hearing.
rule b and the necessary compulsion test 
expert testimony that compels the jury to conclude that the defendant did or did not possess the requisite mens rea does not assist the trier of fact under rule because such testimony encroaches on the jury vital and exclusive function to make credibility determinations.specifically,rule b limits the expert testimony by prohibiting him from testifying as to whether the defendant had the mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged.morales,at.the rationale for precluding ultimate opinion testimony applies to any ultimate mental state of the defendant that is relevant to the legal conclusion sought to be proven.united states campos,cir quoting at.however,rule b allows expert testimony on a defendant mental state so long as the expert does not draw the ultimate inference or conclusion for the jury.morales,at.it is,therefore,essential that we distinguish between expert opinions that necessarily compel a conclusion about the defendant mens rea and those that do not.
in morales,we concluded that the district court erred in barring expert testimony under rule b because the expert testimony did not compel the conclusion that morales lacked the mens rea of the crime.morales,charged with willfully making false bookkeeping entries,wanted an accounting expert to testify that her understanding of accounting principles was weak.id.at.we stated 
even if the jury believed the expert testimony that morales had a weak grasp of bookkeeping knowledge and there was evidence to the contrary,the jury would still have had to draw its own inference from that predicate testimony to answer the ultimate factual morales willfully made false entries.morales could have had a weak grasp of bookkeeping principles and still knowingly made false entries.
in morales,we also cited with approval united states rahm,in which we reversed the district court exclusion of a defense expert who was going to testify that rahm had poor visual perception and consistently overlooked important visual details.morales,at.in rahm,we drew a distinction between the ultimate rahm knew the bills were the proffered testimony of the defendant poor vision,from which the jury could,but was not compelled,to infer that she did not know the bills were counterfeit.id.citing rahm,at.
on the other hand,we have applied rule b to prohibit certain testimony that does compel a conclusion about mens rea.in campos,we upheld a district court exclusion of a polygraph expert from testifying that the defendant was truthful when she stated she did not know she was transporting marijuana.at.we determined that the testimony compelled the conclusion that the defendant did not possess the requisite knowledge to commit the crime because polygraph test results offer an implicit opinion about whether the accused is being deceptive about the very matters at issue in the trial.id.at.
wicks expert diagnosis that finley has an atypical belief system falls into the morales rahm line of reasoning and can be distinguished from campos.the jury could have accepted the atypical belief diagnosis and still concluded that finley knowingly defrauded the banks.if credited,wicks testimony established only that finley beliefs were rigid and he would distort or disregard information that ran counter to those beliefs.wicks did not,and would not be allowed to,testify about finley specific beliefs with regard to the financial instruments.the jury was free to conclude that finley knew the notes were fraudulent,despite the rigidity of his belief system.just as in morales and rahm,the defense was entitled to present evidence so that the jury could infer from the expert testimony that the defendant lacked the necessary intent to defraud,but such a conclusion was not necessarily compelled by the diagnosis.a psychological diagnosis,unlike a lie detector test,does not automatically entail an opinion on the truth of a patient statements.furthermore,the psychological diagnosis can be limited such that it in no way touches upon the specific issues of fact to be resolved by the jury 
we also observe that a jury is free to reject wicks testimony.a jury might decide that finley was untruthful with wicks,as the government so strenuously argues in its brief to this court.see vallejo,at allowing the expert testimony would not displace the role of the jury because,after hearing the expert testimony,the jury was free to decide that the reason for the discrepancy was vallejo lack of his communications disorder.
exclusion of wicks testimony as a rule sanction 
the district court also excluded wicks testimony as a sanction for finley failure to give proper notice under.b c.finley asserts that his notice complied with the requirements of rule and he should not be faulted for the government failure to request additional discovery about wicks testimony as the rule requires.further,finley contends that even if a discovery violation existed,the court erroneously excluded the entire testimony.we agree.
rule b c allows the government to obtain information regarding a defendant expert witness.at the government request,rule requires the defendant to disclose a summary consisting of the witnesses opinions,the bases and reasons for those opinions,and the witnesses qualifications.b c.
finley counsel notified the government of their intent to present expert testimony on finley mental condition.in a letter dated october,counsel explicitly stated he finley also has an atypical belief system,a system which is very rigid.in a second letter,dated october,the defense made clear finley mental condition,as set forth by wicks,will be presented at trial to show that finley did not have the intent to defraud,the requisite mens rea for the crime.finley counsel also supplemented the october and october letters with the psychological tests wicks administered to finley and provided the government with wicks resume disclosing his qualifications.the government did not make a motion for further disclosure of wicks opinion.
later at the pretrial hearing,finley counsel orally explained the b
