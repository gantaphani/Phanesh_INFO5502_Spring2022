the trial court sentenced defendant suzanne amelia carlson to years to life in prison and imposed a restitution fine after a jury found her guilty of second degree murder,subd.a unless otherwise indicated all further statutory references are to the penal code,and gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated with a prior conviction,subd.d.defendant also pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine health,subd.a,driving on a suspended license,subd.a,and driving while in possession of marijuana,subd.b.the court imposed a concurrent sentence and fines for these charges.
defendant contends the trial court erred by refusing to give calcrim,which states voluntary intoxication resulting in unconsciousness can reduce a charge of murder to involuntary manslaughter.in a related argument she attacks her conviction on count,claiming it is inconsistent to allow unconsciousness to reduce one criminal culpability on a murder charge to mere criminal negligence while a charge of gross vehicular manslaughter requires proof of gross negligence.alternatively,defendant argues the court erred in allowing the jury to find her guilty of both murder and gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated for the same act.finally,she asserts that,since the trial court stayed her prison term for gross vehicular manslaughter under section,it erred by imposing a restitution fine for that offense.the attorney general concedes the last argument merit,but otherwise claims no error occurred.
we shall modify the judgment to reduce the restitution fine to,but otherwise affirm the judgment.
defendant suffered three convictions for driving while under the influence of alcohol between and.after each conviction,she participated in drunk driving offender programs and received advisements on the dangers of driving while intoxicated.in addition,her driving privileges were suspended.
in january,defendant worked at a restaurant in mission viejo.one evening,after her shift ended,defendant mother drove her back to the restaurant where she had dinner and drinks with scott turner and others.
around midnight,defendant and turner left the restaurant in turner car.defendant drove the vehicle with turner seated in the front passenger seat.she later told the police the last thing i remember,he was like drive my truck to the next place.we need to go.
defendant apparently pulled the vehicle out of the parking lot and drove it along a public street for slightly over a mile passing through several controlled intersections.there she made a left turn onto the highway toll road.according to the evidence,she drove northbound on the toll road for over miles at an average speed of miles per hour,before transitioning onto the westbound lanes of the freeway.proceeding along the freeway at over miles per hour,weaving between the number four and number five lanes,the car clipped the left rear corner of a,then spun around and slammed into a nearby sound wall.an eyewitness testified he saw the car brake lights illuminate just before the collision.
defendant climbed out the vehicle through its sun roof.turner was unresponsive and pinned in the front passenger seat.paramedics eventually extricated turner from the car and took him to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.
defendant smelled of alcohol,slurred her speech,had bloodshot and watery eyes,and displayed dramatic changes in emotion.she admitted drinking quite a bit of alcohol and feeling its effects.defendant told a truck driver who stopped to provide assistance that she was not driving the car and repeated this claim when later questioned by a paramedic and a california highway patrol officer.asked by the officer where she 
sat in the car,defendant replied,the right front seat guaranteed.but when he inquired about who was driving she did not respond.defendant correctly answered questions concerning person and situation,except she thought she was in mission viejo.
an ambulance took defendant to a hospital.later,when discussing the booking process with a patrol officer,defendant asked,so how is the passenger doing she then stopped,and inquired about the condition of the man in the car.
a blood sample was taken from defendant one and hours after the accident.a test of it indicated her level was percent.a forensic expert estimated she had a level of percent at the time of the accident.
defendant testified,acknowledging she consumed two and beers and a shot of a drink called j√§germeister before her mother drove her to the restaurant for dinner.she also admitted drinking champagne,a couple of shots of a drink called chocolate cake,and red wine at the restaurant.
she recalled turner telling her some jokes and paying for their meals and drinks,but denied being able to recall driving the vehicle.although defendant remembered being involved in the accident,she denied any recollection of getting out of the car,receiving treatment from the paramedics,or being questioned at the accident scene.defendant testified she awoke at the hospital crying,asking where is scott,and being told by a police officer that he was dead.
the defense also called max schneider,a physician specializing in addiction medicine.schneider explained the effects of alcohol consumption on the brain and the concept of a blackout.he interviewed defendant twice,in november and in july.employing a methodology he described as ask ing similar questions in different ways to try and determine whether she was fibbing or giving a truthful answer,schneider concluded defendant suffered a complete blackout on the night of the accident.on,schneider acknowledged he did not attempt to record either interview,make a list of the questions he asked defendant,or memorialize all of her answers to the questions.he admitted his notes concerning the two interviews contained inconsistencies.he also did not employ standardized tests used by psychiatrists to determine whether a person is being truthful or conducting any other medical tests on defendant.
discussion 
the court refusal to give calcrim 
introduction 
the trial court gave the jury the standard instructions on the presumption 
of innocence,the people burden to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,that the crimes charged require proof of the union or joint operation 
of act and wrongful intent,and the prosecution burden included proving not 
only that defendant did the acts charged,but also that she acted with a particular intent mental state.on count,it read calcrim,defining the crime of murder and explaining the concept of malice.
defendant asked the court to also give calcrim as to the murder charge.in part,this instruction states voluntary intoxication may cause a person to be unconscious of his or her actions.a very intoxicated person may still be capable of physical movement but may not be aware of his or her actions or the nature of those actions.when a person voluntarily causes his or her own intoxication to the point of unconsciousness,the person assumes the risk that while unconscious he or she will commit acts inherently dangerous to human life.if someone dies as a result of the actions of a person who was unconscious due to voluntary intoxication,then the killing is involuntary manslaughter.involuntary manslaughter has been proved if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that.the defendant killed without legal justification or 
excuse.the defendant did not act with the intent to kill.the defendant did not act with a conscious disregard for human life and.as a result of voluntary intoxication,the defendant was not conscious of actions or the nature of those actions.the trial court rejected the request.
defendant attacks this ruling.she claims the evidence reflects she suffered an blackout that resulted in her becoming legally unconscious before driving turner car and she did not regain consciousness until waking up at the hospital.according to defendant,the failure to give calcrim violated her right to have the jury decide every material issue of fact and her constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.we conclude these arguments lack merit.
in people watson cal d,the supreme court held a person,with knowledge of the hazards of drunk driving,who drives a vehicle while intoxicated and proximately causes the death of another may be convicted of second degree murder under an implied malice theory.id.at see also people ferguson th.malice is implied when a killing results from an intentional act,the natural consequences of which are dangerous to human life,and the act is deliberately performed with knowledge of the danger to,and with conscious disregard for,human life.citation.people cook cal th.
the prosecution presented evidence defendant suffered three prior drunk driving convictions,resulting in her participation in counseling programs for drunk drivers and being repeatedly advised concerning the hazards of driving while under the influence of alcohol.nonetheless,on the night of the accident,after consuming a substantial amount of alcohol,she drove turner car at an excessively high speed and,while making an illegal lane change,collided with rear of a truck causing turner death.as mentioned,the court instructed the jury on the prosecution obligation to prove defendant committed this act with the mental state of implied malice.
defendant claims the trial court erred by not allowing the jury to determine whether her drinking caused her to become unconscious and thereby reduce her criminal culpability on count to involuntary manslaughter.she cites section,subdivision four,and the rule that while u nconsciousness is ordinarily a complete defense to a charge of criminal homicide i f the state of unconsciousness results from intoxication voluntarily induced,it is not a complete defense.people ochoa cal th.consequently,w hen a person renders himself or herself unconscious through voluntary intoxication and kills in that state,the killing is attributed to his or her negligence in to that point,and is treated as involuntary manslaughter.ibid.we find this rule inapplicable to this case.
first,we agree with the attorney general assertion the record did not warrant giving the proposed instruction.involuntary manslaughter is generally considered a lesser included offense of the crime of murder people ochoa,supra,cal th at,and a trial court duty to instruct on it arises when the evidence raises a question as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense were present citation people breverman cal th.t he existence of any evidence,no matter how weak will not justify instructions on a lesser included offense,but such instructions are required whenever evidence that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense is substantial enough to merit consideration by the jury.citations.substantial evidence in this context is evidence from which a jury composed of reasonable persons could conclude that the lesser offense,but not the greater,was committed.citations.id.at.in applying this standard a court determines only its bare legal sufficiency,not its weight id.at,and should not evaluate the credibility of witnesses id.at.
to constitute a defense,unconsciousness need not rise to the level of coma or inability to walk or perform manual movements it can exist where the subject physically acts but is not,at the time,conscious of acting.citation.people halvorsen cal th,people ochoa,supra,cal th at.the evidence of defendant operation of turner car,plus the observations of witnesses who interacted with her after the accident,reflect defendant engaged in more than mere physical movement,thereby dispelling any reliance on an unconsciousness theory.she not only entered the car,but put on the driver side seat belt and started the vehicle.defendant then pulled the vehicle out of a parking stall,maneuvered it onto a public street,drove along that roadway for over a mile,through several controlled intersections,before negotiating a turn onto the toll road.after operating the car accident free at high speed along the winding and curving toll road for approximately miles,she transitioned onto the freeway before running into the back of the slower moving.an eyewitness saw the car brake lights illuminate just before the collision.as noted,immediately after the accident,defendant climbed out of the car through the sun roof,answered questions,and repeatedly insisted she was not driving the car when the accident occurred.the complicated and purposive nature of h er conduct makes clear that s he did not lack awareness of h er actions during the course of the offense people halvorsen,supra,cal th at.
defendant relies on her own testimony where she denied any recollection 
of driving turner car and schneider opinion,based on his interviews with her,that she suffered an blackout on the night of the accident.a d efendant professed inability to recall the event,without more,i s insufficient to warrant an unconsciousness instruction.citations.people rogers cal th,
see also people heffington d,while a reviewing 
court must assume that the defendant selective recollection was natural,not feigned it is far short of a claim or description of coexistent unconsciousness.
schneider testimony adds little weight since he acknowledged his opinion was 
bas ed on the statements of defendant during two interviews without use of standardized psychiatric tests or other examination of her.
this case is distinguishable from the ones cited by defendant such as people wilson cal d and people bridgehouse cal d.in those cases,the defendant actions after the crime were consistent with one who was unconscious.i n both wilson and bridgehouse,the defendants testified to a mental state consistent with unconsciousness and with prior statements to police.people halvorsen,supra,cal th at.here,by contrast,after the accident,defendant exited the car on her own and immediately announced she was not driving the car.once paramedics and law enforcement officials arrived,she not only responded to their questions,but repeated the claim she was only a passenger.
second,even if defendant presented sufficient evidence of unconsciousness,we agree with the attorney general alternative claim that the amendments to section preclude a defendant from relying on his or her unconsciousness caused by voluntary intoxication as a defense to a charge of implied malice murder.contrary to defendant suggestion,section,subdivision four,which declares p ersons who commit the act charged without being conscious thereof are incapable of committing a crime,is not at issue here.unconsciousness caused by voluntary intoxication is governed by section people walker th,fn.omitted people chaffey th.
the first sentence of section,subdivision a declares,no act committed by a person while in a state of voluntary intoxication is less criminal by reason 
of his or her having been in that condition.case law has recognized this statute is part of california history of limiting the exculpatory effect of voluntary intoxication people timms th,and the foregoing sentence 
means that,with respect to the same conduct,an intoxicated person shoulders the same criminal responsibility as a sober person ibid.in addition,the statute bars the admission of e vidence of voluntary intoxication to negate the capacity to form any mental states for the crimes charged,subd.a,and limits the admissibility of evidence of whether or not the defendant actually formed certain specified mental states,subd.b.
prior to,subdivision b of section stated proof of voluntary intoxication was admissible on the issue of whether or not the defendant actually formed a required specific intent,premeditated,deliberated,or harbored malice aforethought,when a specific intent crime is charged.stats,ch.in people whitfield cal th superseded in part by statute as set out in people reyes th,fn,the court held this statute was not intended,in murder prosecutions,to preclude consideration of evidence of voluntary intoxication on the issue whether a defendant harbored malice aforethought,whether the prosecution proceeds on a theory that malice was express or implied.id.at.
the next year,the legislature amended section,subdivision b so that it now declares e vidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible solely on the issue of whether or not the defendant actually formed a required specific intent,or,when charged with murder,whether the defendant premeditated,deliberated,or harbored express malice aforethought.subsequent cases have recognized the effect of the amendment to section,subdivision b was to preclude evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate implied malice people martin th,see also people turk th,the legislative history unequivocally indicates that the legislature intended to legislatively supersede whitfield and make voluntary intoxication inadmissible to negate implied malice in cases in which a defendant is charged with murder.the supreme court has also recognized,in dicta,that after this amendment,depending on the facts,it now appears that defendant voluntary intoxication,even to the point of actual unconsciousness,would not prevent his conviction of second degree murder on an implied malice theory people boyer cal th,fn.
while defendant seeks to rely on her purported unconsciousness to reduce her criminal culpability,her alleged blackout admittedly resulted from.in people timms,supra,th,the appellate court recognized one of the reasons for amending section,subdivision b in was that the legislature deemed it confusing,in a vehicular homicide case,to allow evidence of voluntary intoxication to aggravate as well as to mitigate the offense.id.at.this confusion is no less true where a defendant relies on his or her voluntary intoxication to assert a claim of unconsciousness.
defendant relies on a portion of the whitfield decision where the supreme court recognized caljic,which is similar to calcrim,was a correct statement of law in the abstract id.at,but inapplicable because t he circumstance that a defendant,when a fatal traffic collision occurs,is unconscious as a result of voluntary intoxication,does not preclude a finding that the defendant harbored malice,because malice may have been formed prior to that time ibid.she argues this appeal is distinguishable because while the defendant in whitfield drank knowing that he would be driving,she drank knowing that she would not be driving.
the problem with this argument is that it is based on the premise voluntary intoxication can still negate a finding of implied malice.in turk,the appellate court declared it is no longer proper to instruct a jury that when a defendant,as a result of voluntary intoxication,kills another human being without premeditation and deliberation without intent to kill,without express malice,the resultant crime is involuntary manslaughter.this instruction is incorrect because a defendant who unlawfully kills without express malice due to voluntary intoxication can still act with 
implied malice,which voluntary intoxication can not negate,in the wake of the amendment to section,subdivision b.to the extent that a defendant who is voluntarily intoxicated unlawfully kills with implied malice,the defendant would be guilty of second degree murder.people turk,supra,th at,fn.omitted.no reason exists to carve out an exception where a person drinks so much as to render him or her unconscious.
defendant contends the foregoing interpretation of section,subdivision b violates her constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.we disagree.
montana egelhoff,d rejected the claim of a defendant convicted of purposely or knowingly causing the death of a person that he was denied federal due process by a state law that barred consideration of voluntary intoxication in determining the existence of a mental state which is an element of a criminal offense.id.at.four justices concurred in an opinion holding the rule that intoxication may be considered on the question of intent was not so deeply rooted as to be a fundamental principle which th e fourteenth amendment has enshrined.id.at.justice ginsburg concurred in upholding the statute.declaring a state legislature certainly has the authority to identify the elements of the offenses it wishes to punish,and to exclude evidence irrelevant to the crime it has defined id.at conc.opn.of ginsburg,she distinguished between invalid laws designed to keep out relevant,exculpatory evidence ibid.and valid laws that merely redefin e the element of the offense ibid,and concluded the montana statute fell into the latter category id.at conc.opn.of ginsburg.
california appellate courts have followed egelhoff in upholding the current version of section against due process attacks.people martin,supra,th stated,the amendment to section results from a legislative 
determination that,for reasons of public policy,evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate culpability shall be strictly limited,and nothing in the enactment deprives a defendant of the ability to present a defense or relieves the people of their burden to prove every element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt id.at.people timms,supra,th declared,like the montana statute,the california legislature could also exclude evidence of voluntary intoxication in determination of the requisite mental state.in short,voluntary intoxication is irrelevant to proof of the mental state of implied malice or conscious disregard.therefore,it does not lessen the prosecution burden of proof or prevent a defendant from presenting all relevant defensive evidence.id.at.no basis exists to hold this reasoning dissolves merely because a defendant voluntary intoxication renders him or her unconscious.
defendant further argues section violates her right to equal protection of the law,claiming it purports to eliminate voluntary intoxication as a defense only in implied malice circumstances but retains it for express malice.timms rejected an equal protection challenge based on the same premise.declaring a defendant does not have a fundamental interest in the specific term of imprisonment or the definition or designation of a particular crime people timms,supra,th at,the court held the twin goals of avoiding confusion arising from the simultaneous use of intoxication evidence to both aggravate and mitigate criminal culpability and bolster ing the deterrent effect of section by underscoring the principle that voluntary intoxication is no excuse for crime ibid,provided a rational basis for not allowing voluntary intoxication to serve as a defense in an implied malice case ibid.again,we find this reasoning equally applicable in this case.
thus,we conclude the trial court properly refused to give calcrim in this case.
validity of defendant gross vehicular manslaughter conviction 
background 
on count,defendant submitted four proposed instructions.two of them directed the jury to apply the standard of a reasonable person in the defendant position in deciding if she acted with gross negligence and was aware of the risk involved a third instruction sought to have the jury consider all relevant circumstances when deciding if defendant acted with a conscious indifference to the consequence the final proposed instruction stated the jury may consider evidence of defendant voluntary intoxication in deciding whether the she acted with a conscious indifference to the consequences.capitalization omitted.after a discussion,the court amended calcrim explanation of gross negligence to add the phrase considering all relevant circumstances,but otherwise rejected defendant proposed instructions.
citing earlier case law allowing unconsciousness resulting from voluntary intoxication to reduce murder to involuntary manslaughter,which defined necessary mental state as criminal negligence people ochoa,supra,cal th at,defendant claims she should be able to defend against the gross vehicular manslaughter charge because her mental state of unconsciousness can not rise to the level of gross negligence required for a conviction on that offense.calcrim.consequently,defendant again asserts the court failure to instruct the jury to consider whether or not she was unconscious at the time of driving deprived her of the rights to due process,equal protection,and the right to have the jury determine every material issue of fact relating to count.
this argument is flawed for two reasons.first,as the attorney general notes,while defendant submitted several proposed instructions relating to the gross vehicular manslaughter
