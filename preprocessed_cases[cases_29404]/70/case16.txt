after three years of proceedings in this contract dispute between companion health services,companion and george kurtz and mary kay reid and their various business entities,the district judge imposed a default as to all counts based on discovery violations by the defendants.the district court eventually lifted the default except as to companion veil piercing claim,allowing the substantive claims to go to trial.after a jury found for companion and awarded over million in damages,kurtz and reid,who were personally liable,appealed the district court various orders pertaining to the default on the veil piercing claim.in this close case,because the district court imposed such a severe sanction based on a very limited slice of the relevant facts,we vacate the sanction and remand for further proceedings.we,however,deny companion for prejudgment interest.
facts background 
this appeal relates to the discovery process during the litigation of a massachusetts state law contract dispute between companion and george kurtz and mary kay reid together,the individual defendants,as well as majors medical,majors mobility,majors mobility zanesville,llc,and mms northern detroit,the corporate defendants stemming from a deal to sell durable medical equipment dme in wal mart stores.companion was authorized to license space within wal mart stores to companies that sell dme.in and,companion entered into licensing agreements with the defendants for three locations in ohio and indiana.in january,companion contracted with the defendants to take over twenty additional locations from a failing licensee,entering into what the parties denote as the master agreement.by march,the defendants,having failed to perform,shut down operations in all locations.thereafter,on november,companion sued the defendants in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,alleging various breach of contract and related tort claims under state law and,significantly,requesting to pierce the corporate veil,such that the liability of the companies would also be imposed on the individual defendants,the two principals of all of the companies 
the litigation began fairly smoothly.after the complaint and answers were filed in november and december of,respectively,the district court held a scheduling conference on january.the parties submitted their initial disclosures on schedule on february.however,on may,the day after submitting their first responses to companion interrogatories and document requests,the defendants attorneys from hanify king moved to withdraw,citing an irretrievable breakdown in the relationship.companion opposed the motion to withdraw,noting that local rules prevented the corporate defendants from appearing before the court without representation,and urged the court to deny the motion unless the withdrawal could be contingent upon the appearance of successor counsel.the district court agreed,noting that the motion would not be allowed until successor counsel had filed an appearance.
companion attorney felt that the may responses to the interrogatories and document requests,which were in large part related to the veil piercing claim,were inadequate,and relayed this concern to hanify king on may,via a discovery letter on may,hanify king told companion attorney that they were close to getting successor counsel and that it would respond to the discovery letter by may.however,they did not respond,and on june,companion filed its first motion to compel responses,asserting that the responses had been inadequate and that not a single document had been produced.the district court did not immediately rule on the motion.
four months after hanify king motion to withdraw,the defendants finally succeeded in obtaining new counsel,and attorneys from crowe dunn filed their appearances on september,on november,the district court granted hanify king motion to withdraw.
proceeding with discovery,companion attorney and the defendants attorneys from crowe dunn agreed that kurtz and reid would be deposed on november and,in boston on november,crowe dunn called companion counsel and informed him that kurtz and reid had decided they would not attend their depositions.after confirming on november that kurtz and reid continued to refuse to come to boston for their depositions,on november,companion filed a motion to compel the depositions of kurtz and reid in boston.the individual and corporate defendants opposed the motion collectively,making jurisdictional arguments as to why the depositions should not take place in boston.
on december,while the motion to compel depositions was pending,crowe dunn provided companion with a sparse supplemental response to the pending interrogatories and document requests,which did not give companion a single new piece of information on december,the parties filed a joint motion to extend the scheduling order,citing the difficulty in carrying out the depositions on december,the district court granted the motion to compel the depositions without explanation,ordering that the individual defendants appear for their depositions in boston within days.a day later,on december,the district court granted the december motion to extend the scheduling order,setting a new deadline of february,for the end of discovery.
on january,allegedly in reliance on promises by crowe dunn that discovery responses beyond the december supplemental response were forthcoming,companion withdrew its motion to compel discovery responses.the motion had been filed on june,and was never ruled on by the district court.however,no further responses came.with little progress being made,on march,companion renewed its motion to compel responses,which was opposed separately by each of the individual defendants as well as by the corporate defendants,largely for the same reasons as were stated in their initial objections 
meanwhile,companion had sought the names and addresses of the corporate defendants former employees in its interrogatories this information was never provided.companion eventually obtained the names of two former employees from a third party and scheduled their depositions to be taken on april.on april,the defendants filed a motion for a protective order,seeking to prevent companion from conducting the two depositions the next day.the defendants objection to the depositions was that kurtz and reid allegedly would have been unavailable to listen in on the phone.on april,the day for which the depositions were scheduled,companion filed its opposition to the motion for the protective order,and the judge denied the motion without explanation.
the depositions went forward on april,and during the depositions,companion obtained the names of additional former employees.on april,companion filed a motion to extend the time for filing summary judgment petitions in order to allow time to depose those additional employees.the next day,the district court granted the motion to extend.
on may,the defendants filed five separate motions for summary judgment,arguing that it was clear that the contract with companion did not contain all material terms and was therefore not binding on them,and further,that piercing the corporate veil was inappropriate on june,companion filed its opposition to the motions for summary judgment,arguing that an agreement between the parties was reached and that the evidence merited a trial as to piercing the corporate veil.
on october,while the motions for summary judgment were still pending,crowe dunn moved to withdraw as counsel for all of the defendants,citing a substantial breakdown of the relationship and an unreasonable financial burden on the firm given that the defendants remain ed in substantial arrears for their legal fees.companion responded to but did not oppose the motion companion did not request that the motion grant be contingent on the appearance of successor counsel as it had previously done but instead focused on its desire that the summary judgment hearing take place on december,as scheduled.
on november,the district court responded in a single order to companion pending motion to compel and to the recent motion to withdraw.as to companion motion to compel,the judge considered each of the defendants objections,overruling both general as well as many of the specific objections,ordering responses and production,while finding that no further answer or production was required for some of companion interrogatories and requests the district court granted the motion to withdraw without explanation and without requiring the appearance of successor counsel 
on december,with the summary judgment hearing set to go forward that day,kurtz,who was in michigan at the time,called the district court clerk and told him that he was unrepresented and would be unable to attend the hearing.the clerk informed kurtz that the judge had a mountain of paper and was ready to proceed with the hearing on the fully briefed motion.the clerk told kurtz to call back later that day to find out the results of the hearing.
the hearing in fact proceeded later that day.at the end of the hearing,companion counsel requested that a deadline be set for compliance with the order granting the motion to compel.mindful of the fact that the defendants were unrepresented,the district court named december,nine days later as the deadline.on december,the district court denied the defendants various motions for summary judgment substantially for the reasons stated in the plaintiff opposition memorandum.
on december,having received nothing by the december deadline,companion filed a motion for sanctions under federal rule of civil procedure,requesting default on all counts.in the alternative,as most of the discovery sought pertained to veil piercing,companion requested default on that count alone.
on january,while the motion for sanctions was pending but before a hearing date had been set,kurtz again called the clerk.the clerk informed kurtz that the summary judgment issue had been decided kurtz requested that the papers be sent to him and provided the clerk with his address shortly thereafter,he received the docket sheet in the mail.kurtz address was handwritten on the envelope.he did not receive any other documents at that time or up to the point when he retained griesinger,tighe maffei in march.in addition to the december decision denying summary judgment,the docket sheet reflected that the court had ordered that discovery be produced by december and also that a motion for sanctions had been filed on december.the docket sheet did not reflect any hearing on the motion for sanctions.
on january,the court scheduled a hearing on the motion for sanctions for february.the docket sheet noted that the corporate defendants had to be represented by counsel in order to appear and that notice of the hearing was mailed to all defendants.however,none of the defendants received the notice,as the corporate address had changed as of september,and the court did not have the new address on record the notice was not sent to kurtz at the address that he had provided to the clerk during the january,call 
no one appeared for any of the defendants at the february hearing,and with little argument or discussion,the district court orally granted the motion in full,imposing default as to all counts.on february,the court set a date of march,for a hearing on damages.
according to kurtz,he first contacted his lawyer in michigan about retaining a new lawyer in boston on february,and got in touch with the office of his eventual third attorney,thomas maffei of griesinger,tighe maffei,in.maffei and kurtz first spoke sometime between wednesday,march and friday,march.maffei then consulted pacer and realized that the damages hearing was to take place on the following tuesday,march.he entered his appearance for all the defendants on monday,march,and also requested that the damages hearing be continued.companion opposed the continuance.the hearing began on march as scheduled,but at the hearing,the district court agreed to continue to may,stating its expectation that the defendants would file a motion to lift the default.
the defendants filed their motion to lift the default on march.they argued that the sanction of default judgment was overly harsh,because it required more than mere negligence,such as willfulness or bad faith.they also argued that they had substantially complied with companion discovery requests,and would further comply in short order.further,they argued that they were unaware of their obligations regarding discovery or responding to the motion for sanctions,as they were unrepresented and did not understand the implications of the information on the docket sheet.finally,the defendants argued that they had legitimate defenses to companion claims on the merits.companion opposed lifting the default,arguing that the sanction was appropriate,and that there was no good cause to lift the default under federal rule of civil procedure c.
on june,after the continuance,the hearing on the motion to lift the default took place before the district court.the court heard argument from the parties and then issued a somewhat lengthy oral decision.first,the district court explicitly stated that it did not take maffei benign view of the situation.instead of viewing the individual defendants as negligent,the district court found that their discovery violations had been willful.once kurtz had the docket in early january,it was apparent from the docket that a deadline for complying with the document request had passed and a motion for sanctions had been filed in response to it.the district court noted that while it was not clear that kurtz knew of the date of the hearing on the motion for sanctions,the record indicates he was aware of the jeopardy and did do anything about it.
the district court then considered whether the sanction of default judgment was proportionate to the offense.determining that the discovery sought went to the veil piercing claim,the district court decided that the intermediate sanction of default judgment only as to that count was appropriate.that way,the contract claims could be addressed on the merits.
after the district court announced its decision,the parties made further arguments.maffei argued that reid should be treated differently from kurtz,as she appeared to have less involvement,but the judge reiterated that he saw the violations as knowing and willful and did not change his order.the district court did not make any other material factual findings,and did not make clear exactly which discovery violations were the basis of its ultimate sanction 
beginning on august,the district court presided over a jury trial.on august,the jury returned a verdict for companion,awarding over million in damages,including more than companion had requested in lost profits and other contract damages.various motions,including companion motion to amend the judgment to include prejudgment interest that is now the subject of companion took place over the course of the next ten months.on may,the individual defendants filed the current appeal,challenging the district court imposition of the veil piercing sanction on june,companion the denial of the motion to amend the judgment and the judgment itself.

here,the district court imposed the sanction of default as to the veil piercing count based on a combination of oral orders first,when it granted the motion for sanctions,and second,when it denied in part the motion to lift the default.in both cases,the district judge restricted its analysis to kurtz and reid failure to respond to the december,deadline,the only basis for companion motion for sanctions.that deadline had been set nine days earlier,during which time the individual defendants,here,the appellants,were unrepresented by counsel.however,the district judge found the failure to comply with the deadline to be willful,where at least kurtz was aware of the jeopardy of sanctions and did do anything about it.though there was perhaps enough litigation misconduct by kurtz and reid for a default sanction if the totality of their behavior during the entire history of the case had been considered,the district court based the sanction on a single instance,for which there were significant and legitimate mitigating excuses,and did not make sufficient factual findings to support its ultimate sanction.under those circumstances,we decline to extend our precedent to find that the sanction of default on the veil piercing count was appropriate.
this sanction apparently was based on a single instance of misconduct,although arguably a continuing one.our precedent makes clear that a severe sanction,such as default or dismissal,is inappropriate in most cases when based on one incident.see crossman,at a single instance of prohibited conduct can not be a basis for a severe sanction if the conduct was not particularly egregious or extreme.quoting top entm t,ortega,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the conduct here can not qualify as particularly egregious,where the defendants were unrepresented and unaware of the deadline at the time it was set.and while we generally give a wide berth to the presider judgment that,under all the circumstances,a proffered justification for failure to comply with a court order is insufficient,tower ventures,at,this is a case where we must ask more of the district court before affirming the imposition of such a harsh sanction apparently based on such a thin slice of misconduct.
this would be a different case if,after allowing kurtz and reid to respond to a much broader charge of misconduct,the district court had supportably found that they had themselves engaged in a deliberate pattern of stonewalling with the aim of frustrating effective discovery and the progress of the case for example,the court might have found that the four extensions to the scheduling order resulted from the defendants misconduct that the individual defendants had acted improperly in objecting to their depositions and those of others or that they had withheld documents in bad faith.after giving kurtz and reid a specific opportunity to respond to and explain their conduct as to individual incidents,and distinguishing between their own actions and those of their lawyers not directed by kurtz and reid,the court might have been able to find them as individuals willfully responsible for a pattern of prolonged and vexatious obstruction of discovery with respect to highly relevant records.new eng.global naps snet,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted citing this pattern of conduct as a basis for the imposition of default judgment on a veil piercing count as a sanction see also crispin taveras,at stating that default judgment provides a useful remedy when a litigant is confronted by an obstructionist adversary and plays a constructive role in maintaining the orderly and efficient administration of justice.however,the district court did not mention any of the foregoing as part of the basis for the sanction,and therefore we do not consider them in our review.see robson,at declining to consider potential pattern of litigation misconduct where only one incident formed the basis for the district court sanctions order.
while the imposition of a default judgment on a veil piercing claim is not unheard of in this circuit,see global naps,verizon new eng.verizon,cir,cert.denied,d,in that case,the misconduct upon which the default sanction was based was significantly more extreme than missing a single production deadline.in verizon,this court affirmed the imposition of default judgment on a claim,where the district court made a number of factual findings that we re well supported in the record showing that the counterclaim defendants had violated the district court orders and committed willful discovery misconduct,including the destruction of evidence and lying to the court.id.at.the second circuit later also affirmed the same sanction in a related case,basing its holding on the willfulness behind the violations and the fact that the conduct of the sanctioned parties was not isolated but rather formed a pattern of prolonged and vexatious obstruction of discovery with respect to highly relevant records pertaining to the veil piercing claim.snet,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the second circuit also considered important the fact that the parties were unmistakably on notice of their discovery obligations at the time of the violations,given the clarity of the district court orders and its previous warnings.id.at.
though we by no means suggest that the defendants here were faultless,for they were not,the facts of this case suggest less egregious circumstances than those in verizon and snet.there was no destruction of evidence or explicit finding of false statements to the court.see snet,at verizon,at.there were no clear warnings that sanctions were imminent.see snet,at basing affirmance of default sanction in part on district court warning that default would be imposed remexcel,at noting that repeated,stern warnings by the district court supported the appropriateness of default judgment.kurtz and reid were unrepresented by counsel from the time of the discovery deadline to the time the default was originally imposed and therefore were not unmistakably on notice of their discovery obligations at the time they initially violated the district court december,order.see snet,at finding no abuse of discretion in imposition of default judgment where party was clearly on notice of discovery obligations.though not in formal compliance with the local rules,kurtz did attempt to leave a current address with the clerk when he called on january,but received only the single communication containing the docket sheet in an envelope bearing a handwritten address and thereafter,no further notifications as to the district court proceedings.finally,the district court did not make factual findings that the defendants had engaged in a pattern of obstruction or stonewalling.see snet,at emphasizing importance of pattern of prolonged obstruction in the determination of default judgment as an appropriate sanction.
while the imposition of default on a veil piercing count as a rule sanction could on some evidence be appropriate,here,the factors distinguishing this case from verizon and snet persuade us that,on the basis of the conduct considered by the district court and the factual findings it made,such a sanction was not warranted.unlike the district court,we do not view such a sanction as an intermediate one.we therefore vacate the default and remand to the district court for further proceedings,after which the court may make additional findings with respect to the need for additional sanctions beyond the fee sanction already granted and if so,the nature of the sanction that it deems appropriate.
companion cross appeal 
companion the district court order declining to amend the judgment to impose an award of prejudgment interest on a portion of the damages,as well as the original judgment so unamended.the jury awarded companion a total of in contract damages an amount greater than companion had argued it suffered in lost profits.the district court therefore imposed prejudgment interest only on the portion of the award that companion had requested,or a total of

under massachusetts law,in most circumstances,prejudgment interest is not awarded for attorney fees,even where the attorney fees are provided for in a contract.see interstate brands lily transp,d,noting that.laws ch,does not impose prejudgment interest where attorneys fees are not really an element of damages flowing from breach but rather an additional right of recovery incident to that breach which vests when a party successfully takes action to enforce its rights.this is exactly the situation which presents itself here,and is in contrast to a context where,for example,an insurance company violates a contract based on its failure to perform its duty to defend,such that attorney fees are part and parcel of damages for breach of contract.id.at citing sterilite cont l cas.because the district court considered the damages awarded in excess of the amount demanded by companion to be attorney fees,there was no error of law in declining to award prejudgment interest on that portion of the award,and therefore no abuse of discretion.we decline to disturb the ruling of the district court on prejudgment interest.
iii.conclusion 
it remains within the sound discretion of the district court to decide whether to consider further the adoption of a default sanction on the veil piercing issue,some other sanction such as attorneys fees for unnecessary delays and failure to complete discovery,or any other measure deemed appropriate and,of course,any sanction ultimately imposed should be accompanied by appropriate findings.assuming that the issue is not one that can be otherwise resolved,a trial on the veil piercing count may be necessary.
the district court committed no error in declining to award prejudgment interest on the attorney fees owed to companion,so as to its,we affirm.
each party shall bear its own costs.

hanify king moved to withdraw its representation of both the corporate and the individual defendants.
in their may responses,the defendants made general objections to the time period of the requested information,alleging that only information was relevant.companion countered that information was relevant to the veil piercing claim.the defendants also objected to companion definition of terms for purposes of setting the scope of the discovery requested.further,the defendants made specific objections to various interrogatories and document requests,claiming that many of the requests were overbroad,that much of the information requested was irrelevant to companion claims,or that the information and documents requested did not exist or were protected by privilege.reid refused to answer one particular interrogatory,claiming that a affidavit was not attached.however,the defendants asserted that they would make some documents requested available to companion and answered some interrogatories in whole or in part.
