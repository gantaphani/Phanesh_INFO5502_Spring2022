background 
a.the pepper spraying incident 
on june,a riot broke out in housing unit of the potosi correctional center pcc.the riot was quelled quickly,and all inmates were returned to their cells.after the unit was secure,a search for weapons and contraband was ordered.special units of corrections officers trained to handle riots,known as emergency squads,were activated and instructed to impose temporary administrative segregation confinement tasc on the inmates.when a tasc order is given,each inmate is,handcuffed,and his cell is searched for weapons and contraband.
approximately five hours after the riot,a search team led by hays arrived at lawrence and kirksey cell.hays called out,niggers get naked.lawrence responded by asking,what did you say hays reacted to this question by calling for a movement team,and officer carl mccory immediately sprayed lawrence and kirksey with pepper spray,using a device known as a.the superintendent of pcc at the time of the incident,michael bowersox,testified that a consists of a twelve to wand attached to a large cannister,and resembles a fire extinguisher.lawrence and kirksey,along with the entire interior of their cell,were soaked with pepper spray from the.after approximately ten minutes of inhaling the chemical agent,lawrence and kirksey were removed from their cell and taken to the showers to clean up.lawrence testified that the incident resulted in intense burning on his skin for several days after the event.
procedural history

ii.discussion 
hays motion for judgment as a matter of law 
we review a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.van steenburgh rival,cir.we must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the inmates,give them the benefit of all reasonable inferences,and assume the jury resolved all evidentiary conflicts in their favor.id.we will overturn the verdict only if no reasonable juror could have found in favor of the inmates.id.
the eighth amendment requires prison officials to take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates.hudson palmer,d.however,not every injury to a prisoner translates into constitutional liability for prison officials responsible for the victim safety.farmer brennan,d.a prison official is liable for violating the eighth amendment in a failure to protect case only when two requirements are met.first,the inmate must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing an objectively substantial risk of serious harm.id.second,the inmate must prove that,subjectively,the prison official was deliberately indifferent to the inmate health or safety.id.
hays claims that his motion for judgment as a matter of law should have been granted because lawrence and kirksey failed to prove the objective prong of the farmer test.hays does not argue on appeal that he lacked the requisite mental culpability that forms the second prong of the farmer test.instead,hays claims that the inmates suffered only de minimis injuries from the pepper spray,and thus were not subjected to a substantial risk of serious harm.to support this claim,hays argues that his conduct was analogous to the prison official conduct in jones shields,cir,where we found that an inmate sprayed with pepper spray did not establish an eighth amendment violation.in jones,an inmate while out of his cell refused a work order and when ordered to his barracks became loud and argumentative.the prison official used pepper spray on the inmate in response to the outburst.id.at.the spray was dispensed in a burst from a small can with a trigger and the inmate testified that the effects of the spray cleared within minutes.id.at.the court held that the prison official administration of pepper spray in this prison setting resulted in de minimis injury for eighth amendment purposes.id.at.
jones,however,did not hold that all applications of pepper spray result in de minimis injury.instead,the jones court reasoned that a factual inquiry should take place consider ing the extent of the pain inflicted in order to determine whether a constitutional deprivation has occurred.id.the facts here are quite different than those in jones.the inmate in jones refused direct orders from prison officials to return to his barracks and became threatening.furthermore,the inmate in jones was not confined to his cell and was much larger than the prison official who used the spray.id.at.jones concluded that the limited application of pepper spray was a tempered response when faced with a recalcitrant inmate.id.at.here,on the other hand,lawrence and kirksey were confined to their cell and the evidence does not show that they disobeyed orders.
in addition,while the prisoner in jones was sprayed with a burst from a small can with a trigger,id.at,the evidence at trial established that lawrence and kirksey were doused with pepper spray from a,which,as previously noted,is a large cannister resembling a fire extinguisher with a twelve to wand attached.the facts in this case do not support hays claim that the inmates suffered de minimis injuries.unlike in jones,here,the inmates faces and bodies were soaked in pepper spray as a result of hays call for the movement team.in fact,their entire cell was covered with the spray.one of the officers even proclaimed that is some bad stuff.kirksey claimed that he experienced spotting on his lower body for almost two years following the incident.lawrence testified that he has suffered problems with his skin and eyes following the incident.hays argues that the injury claims by the inmates were refuted by the testimony and records of the nurse who treated them.however,as the inmates brief correctly points out,quoting phillips collings,c
