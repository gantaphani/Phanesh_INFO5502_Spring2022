governing law 
section requires attorneys or parties if they are unrepresented to certify,through their signature on documents filed with the court,that every pleading,motion or other similar paper presented to the court has merit and is not being presented for an improper purpose.musaelian adams cal th,d,martorana marlin saltzman th,d martorana see,subd.b.if,after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond,the court determines the certification was improper under the circumstances,it may impose an appropriate sanction,subd.c.
subdivision c of section contains a safe harbor provision it requires the party seeking sanctions to serve on the opposing party,without filing or presenting to the court,a notice of motion specifically describing the sanctionable conduct.service of the motion initiates a hold or safe harbor period.see martorana,supra,th at,d banks hathaway,perrett,webster,powers chrisman th,d banks.during this time,the offending document may be corrected or withdrawn without penalty.if that occurs,the motion for sanctions shall not be filed.martorana,at,d,subd.c.
by mandating a safe harbor period to allow correction or withdrawal of an offending document,section is designed to be remedial,not punitive.martorana,supra,th at,d.the purpose of the safe harbor provisions is to permit an offending party to avoid sanctions by withdrawing the improper pleading during the safe harbor period.citation.this permits a party to withdraw a questionable pleading without penalty,thus saving the court and the parties time and money litigating the pleadings as well as the sanctions request.see malovec hamrell th,d.

because the trial court ruling on li motion to vacate deprived li of the full safe harbor period to avoid imposition of sanctions,the award of sanctions was improper 
mih waited until april,more than days after serving its motion for sanctions on li,to file the motion with the court.however,because the trial court heard and decided li motion to vacate on april,the day following service of the sanctions motion,li did not have days to correct or withdraw his motion.although the court is authorized to shorten the safe harbor period,subd.c,it did not do so in this case.
a number of appellate courts have recognized,albeit in somewhat different contexts,that once the offending pleading or motion is resolved,the party who filed it has no opportunity to take the corrective action contemplated by the safe harbor provision and an award of sanctions is not proper.see day collingwood th,d day courts in a number of cases have concluded that a motion for sanctions under section that is not served sufficiently in advance of a dispositive ruling on the challenged pleading fails to comply with the safe harbor provision set forth in section,subdivision c malovec hamrell,supra,th at,d party seeking sanctions must leave sufficient opportunity for the opposing party to choose whether to withdraw or cure the offense voluntarily before the court disposes of the challenged contention barnes department of corrections,supra,th at,d motion for sanctions served after judgment entered a t the time the defendant served the motion on plaintiff,there was no action plaintiff could take to avoid the imposition of sanctions.
the rationale for these decisions was explained in day,supra,th,d.in day the defendant,who had successfully moved for summary judgment,sought sanctions pursuant to section,contending the action filed against him was frivolous.the court of appeal upheld an award of sanctions,explaining that,as long as the section motion is served days before the hearing on the challenged document here,the complaint,the fact the section motion was filed with the court following the hearing on
