kimberly skaggs skaggs and equal justice foundation ejf,appeal an order of the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,sanctioning them pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and awarding defendant,village of sterling the village,attorneys fees under.the district court imposed sanctions and attorneys fees on skaggs and the ejf for skaggs conduct as an attorney for jeffrey alan salkil in his civil rights action under.because we find the district court rendered its decision under a clear misapprehension of skaggs conduct,as well as with the benefit of hindsight,we hold that the district court abused its discretion and reverse the order of the district court.
backgrounda.salkil arrest and incarceration 
the events in this case arise out of plaintiff jeffrey alan salkil salkil arrest and subsequent day incarceration in sterling,ohio.on october,patrolman stone of the sterling township police department arrested salkil for operating a motor vehicle under the influence omvi,improper backing,leaving the scene of an accident,and a seat belt violation.stone placed salkil in the madison county jail,where salkil allegedly refused to submit to a urinalysis test.because of salkil alleged refusal to submit to testing,his driver license was suspended pursuant to ohio revised code.
salkil was arraigned the next day.at the arraignment,salkil completed an affidavit of indigency and requested that the court appoint him counsel.the court denied salkil request for appointment of counsel,however,finding that salkil was not indigent because of his employment with a sports equipment company.salkil then informed the court that because of the arrest and incarceration,he no longer had a job.the judge thus instructed salkil to file a new affidavit of indigency,stating that he had no income.
after the arraignment,salkil was returned to the madison county jail.although the court had set bail at,salkil was unable to post the requisite bail bond.the municipal court would not accept salkil debit card,and no local bail bondsman would assist salkil because he was not an ohio resident.consequently,salkil was forced to remain in jail.
salkil remained in jail without access to counsel for a full month and a half.according to salkil,he was unable to timely file a new affidavit of indigency as instructed by the court because the jail guards refused to give him the proper forms,despite his repeated requests.on november,salkil completed and filed an affidavit of indigency and the court appointed shirley hangsen as his counsel.hangsen met with salkil for the first time midway through november.finally,on november,after salkil had spent days in prison,he was released on his own recognizance.
thereafter,hangsen negotiated a plea agreement with the village of sterling prosecutor,mark pistick.pistick agreed to drop all charges against salkil in exchange for salkil agreement to release the village from all liability under.according to salkil,hangsen informed him that the village would not agree to any plea unless salkil released the village from liability and that the release was standard practice.against hangsen advice,salkil refused to agree to the release.
despite salkil refusal to agree to the release,hangsen sent a joint order of dismissal signed by pistick to the court.on january,the municipal court entered an order dismissing all charges against salkil.the order contained a finding,agreed upon during the plea negotiations,that no probable cause existed for the omvi.that finding was necessary to terminate the suspension on salkil license.ohio h a.for reasons unclear from the record,however,the suspension on salkil license was never terminated.
sometime after the order was entered,pistick learned that salkil had not agreed to the release.nonetheless,pistick did not reinstate the charges.salkil claims that he did not learn of the dismissal until december of,and that prior to that time,he assumed that plea negotiations were ongoing because he would not agree to the release.consequently,salkil remained without a valid driver license.
salkil action 
on january,salkil filed a pro se complaint pursuant to in federal district court alleging false arrest,abuse of process,false imprisonment,malicious prosecution,legal malpractice,and various constitutional claims.salkil named the following parties as defendants sterling township police department and patrolman stone madison county municipal court and municipal court judge david pickens madison county sheriff department and officers lilly,creamer,liska,and cochran madison county jail and corrections officer lawrence sterling village solicitor officer and prosecutor mark pistick the law firm of tanner,matthewson and hangsen,and its partner shirley hangsen and the state of ohio.discovery and numerous motions to dismiss ensued.
on march,approximately one year after the commencement of the action,skaggs,executive director of the ejf,entered her first appearance on behalf of salkil.that same day,skaggs moved to amend salkil complaint and eliminate salkil claims against all but two defendants the village of sterling and the sterling township police department.the district court initially denied the motion to amend the complaint,but shortly thereafter,sua sponte requested that skaggs file a statement setting forth salkil remaining claims and their respective legal justification.in accordance with the district court request,skaggs filed a statement of salkil remaining claims.the statement included a claim against the village entitled release of liability,based on the village attempt to enter into a agreement with salkil.the statement also set forth the factual background that formed the basis for this claim,including salkil refusal to sign the agreement,and the village decision not to reinstate the charges against salkil despite his refusal to sign the agreement.
over the village objections,the district court granted salkil leave to file an amended complaint.the district court expressly held that the village objections to the claims were more appropriately addressed in a motion to dismiss rather than in a denial of leave to amend.pursuant to the district court order,skaggs filed an amended complaint on behalf of salkil.the amended complaint contained four claims a sixth amendment claim premised on salkil inability to access counsel while incarcerated a fourth amendment claim premised on salikil day incarceration a fourteenth amendment claim premised on defendants failure to accept salkil bond payment and a first amendment claim,under the petitions clause,premised on the village attempt to force salkil to sign a agreement waiving his right to sue.the first amendment claim was salkil sole claim against the village.
c.the village motion for judgment on the pleadings 
on july,the village simultaneously served skaggs with a motion for judgment on the pleadings and a letter requesting that salkil withdraw his first amendment claim against the village pursuant to rule.the letter stated that the first amendment claim was frivolous for the reasons stated in the motion for judgment on the pleadings and warned that the village would seek sanctions if the first amendment claim was not withdrawn.the motion for judgment on the pleadings included a two page memorandum,which argued that salkil first amendment claim fail ed to present a cognizable action based on existing case law.the village reasoned as follows 
the coughlen case,a copy of which is attached to this motion for the court convenience,holds that plea agreements releasing the village,police officers,and prosecutors from misconduct do not support meritorious civil rights claims unless it can be demonstrated that the criminal charges are filed frivolously in an attempt to protect those committing misconduct from having to face potential civil liability.in this case,given that plaintiff has already admitted the underlying charges were viable,but simply disagrees with the idea of a criminal plea agreement including a waiver of civil liability,plaintiff does not present a viable civil rights claim.in fact,the united states supreme court in town of newton rumery,d declared such plea bargain releases are not against public policy and do not impose coercive situations upon criminal defendants.id.at.for these reasons,plaintiff amended complaint,as it brings a claim against the village must be dismissed with prejudice.
at.nowhere in the motion for judgment on the pleadings or the memorandum in support did the village argue that salkil did not have standing to bring the first amendment claim.
skaggs responded on behalf of salkil accordingly,filing a memorandum in opposition to the village motion on july.in particular,skaggs responded to the sole claim put forth in the village salkil complaint failed to present a cognizable first amendment claim because the supreme court decision in rumery rendered agreements constitutional where the underlying charges are supported by evidence.relying on this court decision in coughlen,skaggs argued that agreements are invalid unless agreement is voluntary,there is no prosecutorial misconduct,and the agreement does not adversely affect the relevant public interests.according to skaggs,the agreement in this case was not voluntary because salkil refused to agree to it,and there was evidence of prosecutorial misconduct in that salkil spent days in jail for an omvi.she further argued that determining the constitutionality of agreements required a case by case assessment,thereby implying that a policy or practice requiring agreements in all cases could not pass constitutional muster.
the village replied on august,reiterating its position that the first amendment right to petition the government is not implicated by agreements.ignoring the language of the first amendment guaranteeing the right to petition the government,the village argued that t he first amendment guarantees free speech and associational rights.no where sic in plaintiff amended complaint or memorandum in opposition does plaintiff ever state how or why the first amendment provides some constitutionally protected right that deals with plea bargains offered to criminal defendants.at.
the court granted the village motion for judgment on the pleadings on december,construing the motion as one for failure to state a claim.the district court held that salkil failed to state a first amendment claim because the village never actually deprived salkil of the right to petition the government.according to the district court,an unsuccessful attempt to deprive a person of a constitutional right is not actionable under.the district court reasoned that the attempt was clearly unsuccessful because salkil was able to maintain the instant action and the village did not raise the release as a defense.on january,the district court dismissed salkil remaining claims.two weeks later,on january,skaggs moved to withdraw from salkil representation.
d.the village motion for sanctions and attorneys fees 
after the district court dismissed salkil claims and skaggs withdrew from his representation,the village moved for attorneys fees under federal rule of civil procedure d and b,and sanctions under federal rule of civil procedure and against both salkil and skaggs.the village based its request for sanctions and attorneys fees on its position that salkil first amendment claim was frivolous.skaggs responded to the motion for attorneys fees and sanctions reiterating the position she had maintained throughout the litigation that a policy or practice of demanding agreements may violate the first amendment right to petition the government.she further explained,albeit for the first time,that salkil was harmed by the village policy because it delayed his ability to regain his license.skaggs also stated that she disagreed with the district court ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings,but assuming that the district court ruled correctly,it was still a close question of law.
on april,the district court granted the village motion for sanctions against skaggs pursuant to rule.the court reasoned that despite the july,letter requesting that skaggs withdraw salkil first amendment claim or face rule sanctions,skaggs continued to assert the untenable legal theory that the village violated salkil first amendment rights the district court seemingly believed that existing case law did not support the position of skaggs and the ejf because existing case law only addresses the enforceability of agreements and not mere offers for such agreements.in its order dated april,the district explained,stating 
as previously stated,while a party seeking to enforce a plea agreement has the burden of proving enforceability,this analysis does not apply to this case because no one attempted or threatened to enforce the agreement.the release agreements are not per se invalid as contrary to public policy skaggs never argued for an extension,modification,or reversal of the existing law,or the establishment of new law because this court finds that there was no reasonable basis in law and fact for the position taken by skaggs,this court finds that skaggs violated rule b and grants the village motion for sanctions.
at.the order also directed the parties to file briefs addressing the monetary amount that the court should sanction skaggs and the ejf.
thereafter,skaggs moved for reconsideration of the imposition of rule sanctions on the ground that the district court improperly applied the version of rule.skaggs argued,among other things,that the version of rule did not allow the court to impose monetary sanctions.the village motion in opposition was,for the most part.
on july,the district court held a hearing on the issue of sanctions.the court questioned skaggs and her attorney,kathleen trafford,about skaggs reasons for believing that a viable first amendment claim existed.significantly,the district court raised the issue of standing for the first time.skaggs and trafford explained that at the time skaggs filed the amended complaint skaggs believed that salkil had standing because skaggs understood the continuing suspension of salkil license to be a direct consequence of his refusal to sign the.
on august,the district court issued an opinion and order affirming its decision to impose sanctions on skaggs and the ejf under rule.the district court reiterated its position that salkil first amendment claim was not supported by existing law or a argument for its extension.the district court again reasoned that existing case law only addresses the legality of agreements actually executed,and in this case,no agreement was ever executed.thereafter,the district court went on to address an additional issue that,according to the district court,salkil raised for the first time in her memorandum in opposition to sanctions the pattern or practice nature of salkil claim.without addressing the viability of a pattern or practice claim under the petitions clause,the district court reasoned that salkil could not make a pattern or practice claim because salkil was not a victim of the village alleged policy or practice of demanding agreements.in other words,the district court seemingly determined that salkil lacked standing to raise a policy or practice claim because the village did not attempt to enforce the agreement against him or reinstate the charges.the district court rejected skaggs theory that salkil was harmed by the continuing suspension on his license by explaining that the continuing suspension did not appear to be a consequence of salkil refusal to sign the agreement but rather hangsen failure to inform salkil that the village had dismissed the charges against him.in conducting its standing analysis,the district court failed to consider whether skaggs belief that salkil possessed standing was reasonable at the time skaggs was advancing the first amendment claim on behalf of salkil.in addition,the new order imposed attorneys fees on skaggs under.in contrast to the rule sanctions,the court justified attorneys fees under solely on salkil lack of standing.skaggs and the ejf now appeal the imposition of sanctions under rule and attorneys fees under.
discussion 
there are two issues before this court today whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing sanctions on skaggs and the ejf under rule and whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing attorneys fees on skaggs and the ejf under.for the reasons set forth below,we find that the district abused its discretion in both instances.
standard of review 
it is that this court reviews a district court decision to impose sanctions under rule or attorneys fees under for abuse of discretion.ridder city of springfield,cir.a district court necessarily abuse s its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.cooter gell hartmarx,d.
the district court based its sanctions decision on two alternative grounds.first,the district court held that skaggs acted unreasonably because salkil first amendment claim was unwarranted in light of existing case law.second,the district court held that skaggs acted unreasonably because salkil lacked standing to raise a claim based on the village offer of a agreement.both grounds were impermissible bases for the district court decision and constitute an abuse of discretion because the district court conclusion that salkil first amendment claim was unwarranted in light of existing law was based on a clearly erroneous characterization of salkil first amendment claim and the district court conclusion that salkil lacked standing was made with the benefit of hindsight.
rule requires attorneys to act reasonably.
rule prohibits attorneys from filing any pleading,written motion,or other paper,unless to the best of the attorney knowledge,information,and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances the claims,defenses,and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.fed civ.b.arguments for the extension of existing law need not be identified as such.see.advisory committee note although arguments for change of law are not required to be specifically so identified,a contention that is so identified should be viewed with greater tolerance under the rule.in this circuit,the test for whether rule sanctions are warranted is whether the conduct for which sanctions are sought was reasonable under the circumstances.ridder,at.
the district court conclusion that skaggs unreasonably advanced a frivolous first amendment claim on behalf of salkil was based on a clearly erroneous characterization of salkil claim.
the district court very clearly misapprehended salkil first amendment claim.the district court believed that salkil was alleging the village mere offer of a agreement violated the first amendment.in fact,skaggs was advancing a dramatically different legal argument on behalf of salkil.skaggs was arguing that the village had a policy or practice of requiring defendants to waive their legal claims where the village had violated the defendants constitutional rights,and that this policy violated the first amendment petitions clause.skaggs position is evidenced in the complaint itself,in addition to her statements at the sanctions hearing.the complaint reads 
violation of based on freedom to seek redress from the government guaranteed by the first amendment 
salkil was offered a plea agreement.
in that agreement,salkil would have had to release the village from liability for its role in the violation of salkil constitutional right.
from belief,this type of agreement is common when the village violates a person constitutional rights.
this policy or custom of forcing defendants to release the village from liability in order to receive a plea agreement is arbitrary and unreasonable.
at.additionally,at the sanctions hearing,salkil further explained that the village did not simply offer salkil a agreement,but attempted to force it upon him.despite the clear language of salkil complaint,and numerous other memoranda filed in this case,the district court clearly failed to grasp salkil claim.in its final sanctions opinion,the district court noted 
at the hearing on this motion,skaggs articulated a new justification for the claims she asserted against the village.she said that she believed the village was pursuing an unconstitutional policy of demanding a release in every plea agreement this is the first time it has been suggested that this litigation was anything other than a personal claim for damages by salkil.
at.the above quoted language clearly demonstrates the district court failure to accurately characterize salkil first amendment claim.
the difference between the district court misapprehension of salkil first amendment claim and salkil actual first amendment claim was not insignificant it affected the district court assessment of the reasonableness of skaggs conduct.the district court perhaps correctly concluded that existing case law could not be extended to render mere offers of agreements unconstitutional.this,however,was not salkil claim.salkil alleged that the village maintained a policy or practice of requiring agreements in all cases where the village violated a defendant constitutional rights.it is not unreasonable to suggest that a municipality policy or practice of demanding agreements for the sole purpose of avoiding constitutional responsibilities violates the first amendment.although both this court and the supreme court have approved the use of agreements,see town newton rumery,d and coughlen coots,cir,both courts have also stated that the validity of such agreements must be assessed on a case by case basis.a policy or practice of demanding that such agreements be a part of every plea deal,necessarily precludes a case by case treatment of such agreements.furthermore,this court has warned against enforcing agreements where there is evidence of government misconduct.see coughlen,at s hould a court conclude that a prosecutor secured a bargain in the face of substantial evidence of police misconduct,the court could take this as evidence of prosecutorial misconduct salkil day tenure in prison while awaiting trial on a charge could reasonably give rise to an inference of police misconduct and thereby prosecutorial misconduct.
this is not to say that a municipality policy or practice of demanding agreements violates the first amendment.little case law exists on this issue,and the case law that does exist is not directly on point.rumery and coughlen address the enforceability of individual agreements,not the validity of a policy requiring such agreements.see generally rumery,at.coughlen,at.additionally,rumery and coughlen are not first amendment cases,but cases based on federal policy.see generally rumery,at.coughlen,at.
instead,we note only that it is unlikely that the district court would have concluded that salkil first amendment claim was not warranted by a argument for the extension of existing law if it had properly apprehended salkil claim.rumery and coughlen,while not directly on point,indicate that agreements are subject to court scrutiny.moreover,lest we not forget,the language of the first amendment itself expressly precludes depriving persons of the right to petition the government.const.amend.i congress shall make no law abridging the right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances.a municipality attempt to avoid liability for a constitutional wrong through the blanket use of agreements arguably conflicts with this language.see cal.motor transp.trucking,d of trainmen virginia,d the state can not use direct means to bar plaintiffs from resorting to the courts to vindicate their legal rights.the right to petition the courts can not be so handicapped.consequently,skaggs interpretation of the first amendment,while not necessarily correct,was not unreasonable.
the district court conclusion that salkil lacked standing was made with the benefit of hindsight.
perhaps realizing its error,the district court gave alternate grounds for imposing sanctions in its final sanctions opinion.concluding that skaggs had failed to raise the policy or practice claim,the district court nonetheless held that salkil lacked standing to bring a policy or practice claim.the district court reasoned that salkil lacked standing because the village alleged policy or practice had not harmed salkil.while the district court determination that salkil lacked standing was probably correct,it was not a proper basis for rule sanctions.a district court may only impose rule sanctions for conduct unreasonable under the circumstances.the record in this case,clearly indicates that under the circumstances,skaggs failure to recognize salkil lack of standing was reasonable.in concluding otherwise,the district court improperly evaluated skaggs conduct with the wisdom of hindsight,thereby abusing its discretion.
as this court has recognized on numerous occasions,assessing whether conduct is reasonable under the circumstances requires the district court to analyze counsel conduct as it appeared at the time counsel acted.
although a district court is given wide discretion in deciding whether counsel have acted reasonably under the circumstances,t he court is expected to avoid using the wisdom of hindsight and should test counsel conduct by inquiring what was reasonable to believe at the time counsel acted.
invst fin.group,cir quoting.advisory committee note see,in re big rapids mall.to avoid using hindsight in assessing counsel conduct,it is useful to look at whether other parties to the litigation recognized counsel error at the time it was made.a mistake can hardly be characterized as unreasonable,or below some objective standard,when the mistake is made by all parties to the litigation.
in this case,the district court failed to address skaggs conduct from the perspective of a reasonable attorney at the time skaggs acted,thereby abusing its discretion.although the district court legal analysis of standing was likely correct,the district court conducted the analysis without inquiring into the reasonableness of skaggs belief that salkil possessed standing at the time she advanced his claim.rule requires district courts to assess an attorney conduct from the standpoint of a reasonable attorney at the time counsel committed the sanctionable conduct.thus,the district court abused its discretion in sanctioning skaggs for salkil lack of standing.
the record in this case indicates that,at the time she acted,skaggs belief that salkil possessed standing was not unreasonable,particularly because neither the district court nor the village recognized that standing was an issue.before filing the amended complaint,skaggs informed both the village and the district court of the factual basis that ultimately led the district court to conclude that salkil lacked standing.skaggs filed a statement of remaining claims that expressly recounted salkil steadfast refusal to enter into the agreement and the village decision not to reinstate the dismissed charges.nonetheless,not only did the district first raise standing during the sanctions hearing,the district court permitted skaggs to file the amended complaint after reading the statement of remaining claims.steel citizens for a better env t,d holding that federal courts have an independent obligation to assess jurisdiction.similarly,the village failed to challenge the amended complaint based on standing,despite having a financial incentive to do so.in fact,the village maintained throughout oral arguments that the proper basis for sanctions and attorneys fees was not standing but skaggs position on the first amendment.if both the district court and the village failed to recognize the standing issue,this court can only conclude that at the time salkil filed the amended complaint,the standing issue was not an obvious one.although we emphasize that skaggs had a duty to assess her client constitutional standing independent from that of the district court or the village,we can not find that skaggs failure to recognize the standing issue was unreasonable.
the dissent analysis suffers from the same flaw in reasoning as that of the district court.the dissent analyzes facts which came forth at various points during the duration of the lawsuit as if the facts were all available to skaggs when she filed the amended complaint.thus,instead of focusing on whether salkil conduct was reasonable under the circumstances,the dissent focuses on whether salkil ultimately had standing.this is simply not the proper inquiry.
moreover,the dissent attempt to bolster its conclusion by citing two instances in which the village passingly referenced the term harm is misleading.both references,practically incomprehensible,are no more than two to three sentences buried in more extensive discussions of first amendment law,and in context simply appear as an extension of the village argument that salkil claim was not grounded in existing first amendment law inasmuch as existing case law only deals with situations in which agreements were actually enforced.this point in particular was made clear at oral arguments when the village denied that standing was a basis for sanctions.only in hindsight do these opaque references seem to carry any meaning.
to the extent these references can be interpreted as addressing the component of article iii standing,they are also unresponsive to salkil theory of harm.the references state that salkil suffered no harm because the village never attempted to enforce any agreement.however,salkil argued that the village attempted to force him to sign the agreement by essentially harassing him he never contended that the village attempted to enforce the agreement against him.in other words,his theory of harm was never that the village harmed him by enforcing the agreement,but rather that they delayed the removal of the suspension on his license.accordingly,we are not persuaded that the village ever recognized the standing problem,let alone put salkil on notice of the standing problem.
similarly,we find that the district court abused its discretion in assessing attorneys fees against skaggs and the ejf.section provides that any attorney who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess of costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.ridder,at quoting.section imposes an objective standard of conduct on attorneys,and courts need not make a finding of subjective bad faith before assessing monetary sanctions under.id.citing jones continental,cir.instead,a district court may impose sanctions under when it determines that an attorney reasonably should know that a claim pursued is frivolous.id.quoting jones continental,at.simple inadvertence or negligence,however,will not support sanctions under.id.quoting in re ruben,cir.there must be some conduct on the part of the subject attorney that trial judges,applying collective wisdom of their experience on the bench could agree falls short of the obligations owed by a member of the bar to the court.id.quoting ruben,at.moreover,an award of attorneys fees against a losing plaintiff in a civil rights action is an extreme sanction,and must be limited to truly egregious cases of misconduct.id.at quoting jones,at applying in the context of a civil rights attorney.
in this case,the district court imposed attorneys fees under for the same reason it imposed rule sanctions salkil lacked standing to bring any first amendment claim.as explained in previous section,skagg failure to recognize that salkil lacked standing was not unreasonable.accordingly,it most certainly did not constitute egregious misconduct.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we reverse the order of the district court.
neither the appellants arguments nor the majority opinion have convinced me that the district court abused its discretion in reprimanding kimberly skaggs and the equal justice foundation pursuant to,and sanctioning them pursuant to.
the district court reprimanded skaggs for unreasonably pursuing a claim on jeffrey salkil behalf that was not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law,in violation of rule b.the claim,as skaggs presented it,was that salkil was harmed because his refusal to agree to the liabi
