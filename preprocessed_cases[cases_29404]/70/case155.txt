the appellant,mark mandell,an attorney who represented defendant paul steinberg associates,in a nonjury trial conducted in the united states district court for the southern district of new york motley,appeals from the district court ruling,summarily holding him in contempt and imposing a fine of,for asking a question which the court believed to be in contravention of its rulings.
we reverse the contempt conviction,for two reasons,one substantive,the other procedural.first,because willfulness is an essential element of criminal contempt,one may not be held in contempt for violation of a court orders unless the order was of sufficient clarity to give the individual clear warning that the conduct is prohibited.in this case,no such clear warning was given.the court prior rulings did not clearly communicate that the question mandell asked would not be allowed.the second reason is a defect of process.the court held mandell in contempt of court without offering him notice or a meaningful opportunity to be heard.recognizing that there are circumstances in which contempt may be imposed without affording the contemnor an opportunity to speak in his defense,no such justifying circumstances were present here.
background 
the incident arose as follows during a bench trial,at the conclusion of the plaintiff case,which sought to set aside a contract between the parties on the ground that it had been procured by the defendant alleged fraudulent concealment,mandell moved on defendant behalf for judgment as a matter of law,arguing that the plaintiff had failed to show fraud.in the course of his argument attempting to show that the plaintiff contention of fraud was a contrivance,mandell asserted that,immediately following the deposition of leo fernandez,the principal of the plaintiff company,the plaintiff had amended its complaint to change its theory of fraud.he urged the court to read the original complaint.the court responded,there must be a reason why we allow amended complaints and inconsistent theories,is that so the court denied the motion and the trial continued.
later,during the direct examination of steve schnur,an employee of the defendant,mandell showed schnur a copy of the defendant counterclaim,elicited that schnur had gone over it with mandell,and asked whether he had read it.the court sustained an objection by plaintiff counsel,explaining,anything in the answer or the complaint of course is superseded by the pretrial order.mandell responded,your honor,i sorry,i did understand.
during mandell direct examination of the defendant principal paul steinberg,mandell handed steinberg a copy of the answer and counterclaims.plaintiff objected and the court said,yes,we been over there.the pretrial order supersedes both.
finally,during the defendant examination of fernandez,who had signed and verified the original complaint on plaintiff behalf,mandell asked him,now,sir,you made a statement in the verified complaint that was served in this case that all the dealings with steinberg were handled by yourself,is that true plaintiff counsel objected on the ground that the original complaint had been superseded by an amended pleading.without permitting mandell to respond,the court said,just a moment.mandell,you fined for contempt of court for asking that question,because i have already ruled several times that the pretrial order superseded the complaint.the court directed mandell to pay the fine by friday.only then,after he had been held in contempt and sentenced,did the court permit mandell to make a record.he stated briefly that his question was based on the witness sworn statement and was directed at the witness credibility and not the successive versions of the pleadings.the court responded,are you finished all right.let go on.payable to the clerk of the court by on friday.
discussion 
a district court judge has the power to hold an individual in criminal contempt and to impose corresponding fines.a court of the united states shall have power to punish by fine at its discretion,such contempt of its authority,including disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ,process,order,rule,decree,or command.a federal court has the power also,in appropriate circumstances,see harris united states,d,to punish summarily for contempt under.a since renumbered rule b contempt orders are reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion,united states wilson,d,but because of the formidable and potentially harmful nature of the contempt power,this review is more rigorous than in other contexts.city of new york local,sheet metal workers int l ass n,cir.
the need for a clear order.
the necessary elements of criminal contempt have not been met in this case.an individual must have fair notice of the court commands before being punished for failing to comply.criminal contempt is punishable only where it is willful,united states lynch,cir,that is,where it is committed with a specific intent to consciously disregard an order of the court,or where the defendant knows or should reasonably be aware he or she is in the wrong,id at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.thus,if the defendant alleged disobedience is consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the court order albeit an interpretation different from the one applied by the court imposing the contempt,and there is no other evidence of willfulness,we would be unable to affirm the conviction.put another way,w here a judge has directed an attorney not to discuss certain issues,the order must be sufficiently clear that an attorney can discern what conduct falls within its scope.united states allocco,cir citations omitted.
the district court rulings did not give mandell fair notice that his question was prohibited.the question mandell asked,which formed the basis of the contempt,did not violate the court previous instructions or rulings,as mandell might reasonably have understood them.as the signatory of the verified complaint,the witness fernandez had made a statement under oath about a matter within his knowledge.now,sir,you made a statement in the complaint that all plaintiff dealings with the defendant were handled by yourself,is that true mandell question sought to have the witness affirm his statement for the purpose of impeaching him by showing inconsistencies between the statement and other evidence proffered by the plaintiff.the fact that the statement used for impeachment was made in the witness affirmation of the complaint,as opposed to being made in an affidavit or deposition,or some other document,was of no moment for mandell impeachment objective.
the court three prior rulings,described above,in no way suggested that mandell was forbidden to impeach a witness by using a statement the witness made in swearing to the original complaint.the court only discussion of the original complaint in the course of these rulings was to explain that disparities between the original and amended complaints did not furnish a reason to dismiss or discredit the amended complaint because parties are permitted by law to amend pleadings and to plead inconsistent theories.that ruling in no way suggested any impropriety in counsel undertaking to impeach as he did.nor did the court two earlier rulings regarding the admissibility of the pleadings suggest that the court would not allow such use of a witness own statement contained in a pleading.the admonition that a nything in the answer or the complaint is superseded by the pretrial order communicated only that,because superseded by the pretrial order,the pleadings no longer defined the issues in controversy.because mandell could not reasonably have known on the basis of the court prior rulings that his question would not be permitted,he could not be held in contempt for putting the question.
the contemnor right to be heard in his defense 
mandell received neither notice that the court was contemplating holding him in contempt,nor opportunity to speak in his defense until after the court had held him in contempt and imposed sentence.and when the court subsequently allowed him to make a record,the opportunity then afforded him to defend was not meaningful.it was clear from the court treatment of mandell subsequent remarks that,so far as the court was concerned,the contempt adjudication was finished business,and the remarks mandell was then permitted simply allowed him to make a record for his appeal.when mandell explained why he believed his question did not violate any of the court rulings,the only response the court made was,are you finished all right.let go on,and to repeat the amount of the fine and the time by which it was to be paid.in view of all the particular circumstances of this case,the denial of any meaningful opportunity for mandell to speak in his defense precluded holding him in contempt,even in a summary proceeding.
a line of decisions of the supreme court,our court,and other circuits has consistently taught that summary punishment without an opportunity even to speak in one defense is regarded with disfavor,see,sacher united states,and that,absent persuasive justification for the denial,a contemnor should be allowed to speak in his defense,notwithstanding the court employment of summary procedure.
in groppi leslie,d,the supreme court addressed the right of a contemnor to speak in his defense in the course of a summary contempt adjudication.the defendant in that case was summarily punished by the legislature of wisconsin for having led a gathering of people which,by its presence on the floor of the assembly during a regular meeting prevented the assembly from conducting public business and performing its constitutional duty.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.two days after the event,without giving the defendant an opportunity to be heard in his defense,the legislature passed a resolution citing him for contempt and directing his confinement for a substantial time.recognizing that legislatures are not constituted to conduct trials or proceedings,id.at,the supreme court nonetheless ruled that under the due process clause of the federal constitution,the contemnor was entitled to notice and the opportunity to answer.id.at.the court explained,w e have stated time and again that reasonable notice of a charge and an opportunity to be heard in defense before punishment is imposed are basic in our system of jurisprudence.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the flaw in the procedure employed was not that it was summary.to the contrary,the court implicitly approved the employment of a summary procedure.the flaw was rather that it was excessively summary in that it denied the contemnor even the basic right to be heard in defense.
a similar issue arose in taylor hayes,d.petitioner was counsel for a criminal defendant charged in the state of kentucky with the murder of two police officers.during the defendant trial for murder in state court,on numerous occasions the trial judge warned petitioner that his conduct was contumacious.immediately following the conclusion of the trial,the judge,without allowing the defendant to speak in his defense,adjudicated him in contempt and sentenced him to confinement.the supreme court held that the procedure does not square with the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.the court reiterated the statement from groppi that reasonable notice of a charge and an opportunity to be heard in defense before punishment is imposed are basic in our system of jurisprudence.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.stressing that the events occurred before the judge own eye,the court made clear it was not saying that a trial was required.id.at.the point was merely that a contemnor is entitled to the elementary due process protections of reasonable notice of the specific charges and opportunity to be heard in his own behalf absent justifications that may sometimes necessitate immediate imposition of summary punishment during trial to maintain order in the courtroom and the integrity of the trial process in the face of an actual obstruction of justice.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the trial judge delay in resolving the contempt until after the trial dispelled the notion that considerations of urgency justified dispensing with the right of the accused to speak in his defense.id.at.
turning to our precedents,it is useful to begin with a particularly instructive decision issued prior to the supreme court opinions reviewed above.see united states galante,cir.immediately following a lengthy narcotics conspiracy trial,marked by contumacious outbursts by the defendant mirra and others,the court filed a certificate in accordance with then rule a,specifying mirra contumacy,attesting that the acts were committed in the court presence as required by the rule,summarily finding him in contempt,and sentencing him to twenty days imprisonment.we affirmed the conviction,rejecting the defendant contention that the delay between the contumacious acts and the imposition of the sanction at the end of trial eliminated urgency and required the court to proceed under the extended procedure of rule b,rather than the summary procedure of rule a.
judge friendly,concurring in part and dissenting in part on a ground the appellant had not raised,agreed with the majority approval of the use of rule a summary procedure,but nonetheless argued that the contempt conviction could not stand because of the judge failure to accord mirra any opportunity to speak in explanation or extenuation,either in person or by counsel.id.at.citing ancient british and united states supreme court authority,judge friendly asserted that a udi alteram partem is basic to our law.i t has long been a received rule in the administration of justice,that no one is to be punished unless he has had an opportunity of being heard.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.judge friendly recognized that e ven a right so basic as that to speak in one own defense must sometimes yield to the overriding necessities of maintaining order in the or of protecting officers of the court,id.at,but that such necessity was not present where the court had waited for weeks after the contumacious conduct to impose the conviction.his opinion emphasized that use of the summary procedure authorized by rule a was in no way incompatible with the defendant right to speak in his defense.summary disposition and summarily mean only that certain usual procedural requirements may be dispensed with,not that the basic right to speak in one defense can be sacrificed.id.
the fact that judge friendly words were uttered in a dissent does not mean that they lack precedential value for our case.the majority opinion did not disagree with the principles of judge friendly dissent.to the contrary,it acknowledged that the reasons for the rule referred to by judge friendly may in a proper case require the court to interrogate the defendant personally.id.at.the majority merely concluded for several reasons that the failure was not reversible error in the particular circumstances 
the authority of judge friendly galante opinion is further bolstered by the supreme court subsequent decision in taylor and our decision in united states lumumba,cir,which undermined the galante majority ruling and expressed views very similar to those of judge friendly on the importance of according a contemnor the opportunity to speak in his defense.in deciding lumumba,we followed taylor and restated some of the principles enunciated in the galante dissent.the contemnor in lumumba,an attorney representing a defendant at trial,was summarily held in contempt after the end of the trial without opportunity to speak in his defense.although his sentence was later imposed by a second judge,who allowed the contemnor to address the court as to his sentence,the sentencing judge did not reopen the question of the finding of contempt.in the end,the contemnor was never given an opportunity to address the charges against him.finding the case nearly indistinguishable from taylor,we vacated the conviction and remanded for new proceedings at which the attorney would be allowed a reasonable opportunity to defend or explain his actions or present arguments in mitigation.id.at.
