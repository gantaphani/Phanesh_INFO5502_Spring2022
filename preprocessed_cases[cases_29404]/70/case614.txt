eplus,eplus,the assignee of patent the patent and the patent,sued lawson software,lawson for infringement.the district court found two of the asserted system claims and three of the asserted method claims not invalid,and a jury found that lawson infringed those claims.in an earlier appeal,we reversed in part on the ground that the system claims were invalid and that two of the asserted method claims were not infringed.we affirmed only the infringement verdict as to one method of the patent.we remanded to the district court to make necessary modifications to the injunction.
on remand,the district court modified the injunction in one respect and found lawson in civil contempt for violating the injunction.lawson appealed both the injunction and contempt order.during the pendency of lawson appeals,the united states patent and trademark office pto completed a reexamination of the patent and determined that claim was invalid.in a separate appeal,we affirmed the pto invalidity determination,and the pto cancelled claim.we now vacate the injunction and contempt order because both were based on claim,which the pto has now cancelled.
background 
this case raises two issues.the first is whether an injunction can continue after the pto has cancelled the only claim on which the injunction was based.the second is whether civil contempt remedies based on the violation of an injunction are appropriate when the injunction has been overturned on direct appeal.
eplus owns the patent and the patent,which both relate to methods and systems for electronic sourcing.see eplus lawson,eplus i.the claimed methods and systems are directed to using electronic databases to search for product information and ordering selected products from vendors.the only claim now at issue in this appeal,claim of the patent,recites a method comprising the steps of maintaining at least two product catalogs on a database,selecting product catalogs to search,searching for matching items,building a requisition,processing the requisition to generate one or more purchase orders,and determining whether a selected matching item is available in inventory.patent to.
in,eplus sued lawson for infringement of the patent and the patent in the eastern district of virginia lawson sells computer software to institutional customers.its products are decide which individual software components to purchase based on their needs.as a result,different customers use different combinations,or configurations,of software modules.the different configurations generally let users search for,select,and order products electronically,but the nature and extent of those capabilities vary depending on the particular modules a customer selects.when eplus sued lawson,the basic software component core procurement allowed users to load products into an internal database item master,search that database for products,create a requisition listing multiple selected products,and generate individual purchase orders to transmit to vendors.requisition self service rss was a module that provided a user interface for the core procurement unit.the procurement punchout module punchout let users search vendors databases for products and put those vendors products on requisitions along with products stored in the internal item master database.
given the modular nature of lawson products,eplus asserted different patent claims against five distinct configurations of software modules configurations.with respect to the asserted claims of the patent and the patent,the jury found that three of the five accused configurations infringed.configurations and were found to infringe two system claims claim of the patent and claim of the patent and three method claims claims,and of the patent.configuration was found to infringe one system claim claim of the patent.configurations and were found not to infringe any of the claims asserted against them.
pursuant to the jury verdicts,the district court permanently enjoined lawson from 
directly or indirectly making,using,offering to sell,or selling within the united states or importing into the united states any of the adjudged infringing product configurations installation,implementation,design,configuration,consulting,upgrade,maintenance and support and training and other related and associated services and any colorable variations thereof the infringing products and services.
the court defined the infringing products and services to include the three software configurations configurations,and adjudged infringing by the jury.the court also enjoined lawson from c irculating,publishing or disseminating within the united states any literature or information that encourages the use,sale or importation of any of the infringing products and services,and from a iding and abetting,actively inducing,or in any way contributing to the making,use,sale or importation of any of the infringing products and services.lawson appealed.
on this first appeal,we determined that the two asserted system claims claim of the patent and claim of the patent were invalid,and that two of the three asserted method claims claims and of the patent were not infringed.we affirmed only the infringement finding as to method claim.only configurations and were found to infringe that claim.as a result of our holding on appeal,configuration was no longer infringing.we remanded for the district court to consider what changes are required to the terms of the injunction,consistent with this opinion.eplus i,at.
after our ruling,the district court ordered the parties to file statements of position on the effect of our decision on the injunction.these were filed before lawson rule b motion discussed below.most importantly,lawson challenged the very provisions of the injunction that led to the contempt sanctions sought by eplus namely,the bar against sales of particular software products.originally,these provisions concerning software sales were supported by the jury findings of infringement of the system claims claim of the patent and claim of the patent after our decision vacated those findings,lawson argued that infringement of a single method claim claim of the patent could not support the injunction against product sales and hence,contempt sanctions based on such sales and that our opinion distinguished sales of software from installation and other services provided to customers this court upheld the finding of induced infringement of claim not based on sales,but based on lawson providing customer services,including software installation,demonstrations,and maintenance lawson also urged that,in light of this court narrowing of the jury infringement findings,the enjoined software products were capable of significant uses and sales of such software should not be enjoined.additionally,lawson argued that under ebay mercexchange,the balancing of equities no longer supported any injunction.eplus argued that the only modification required was the removal of configuration from the list of enjoined products.lawson thereafter filed a rule b motion to modify the injunction.
the district court agreed with eplus position and ordered that the injunction be modified by deleting from its scope the product colloquially known as configuration,and remain in effect in all other respects.
on remand,in addition to reconsidering the injunction,the district court also instituted contempt proceedings.following the jury verdicts,lawson had decommissioned and stopped selling products with rss,the user interface module for core procurement,the basic building block of lawson system.lawson had also redesigned its software in two pertinent respects.first,it redesigned configurations,and by developing a new module,requisition center rqc to replace the rss user interface module.as redesigned,rqc prevented a user from simultaneously putting items from both the internal item master database and a vendor database accessible via punchout on the same requisition.second,lawson redesigned configurations and by developing downloadable software patch that limited the functionality of punchout in configurations and.as modified by patch,those configurations no longer allowed users to put items from multiple thirdparty vendors on the same requisition when using punchout.as a result,users could only build requisitions with products from the internal item master database or from a single database.
eplus alleged that lawson was in contempt for violating the injunction with respect to the redesigned software,arguing that the changes did not make the software more than colorably different from configurations and,and that the redesigned software infringed claim.lawson argued that it was not violating the injunction because the redesigned software was more than colorably different from the originally accused software and that eplus could not show that the redesigned software continued to infringe claim.the court held lawson in contempt for violating the injunction,finding that the redesigned products were no more than colorably different and infringed.the court ordered lawson to pay a compensatory fine of and coercive daily fines of until it could show compliance with the injunction.it declined to award enhanced damages or attorneys fees.lawson appealed the district court modified injunction and contempt order.we stayed the accumulation of fines during the pendency of the appeals.
while lawson appeals were pending,in another case,we affirmed the pto reexamination decision invalidating claim of the patent.in re eplus,fed app x per curiam.our mandate issued,and the pto cancelled claim in april.

discussion 
injunction 
the first question is whether the district court modified injunction against lawson must be set aside now that the pto has cancelled the patent claim on which it is based.it is well established that an injunction must be set aside when the legal basis for it has ceased to exist.in pennsylvania wheeling belmont bridge,how,the supreme court approved an injunction sought by the state of pennsylvania,ordering the removal of a bridge across the ohio river because it illegally obstructed navigation.congress subsequently enacted a law authorizing the bridge.pennsylvania wheeling belmont bridge,how,wheeling bridge.pennsylvania requested that the court execute its decree ordering the abatement of the bridge and punish the defendants for contempt for violating the court order by failing to remove the bridge.id.at.the court denied the motions and instead dissolved the injunction because there wa s no longer any interference with the enjoyment of the public right inconsistent with law.id.at.the court held that an injunction is executory,a continuing decree if,in the mean time,since the decree,this right has been modified by the competent authority it is quite plain the decree of the court can not be enforced.id.at.because the bridge was no longer unlawful,the court had to set aside the previous order rather than enforce it.
the principles of the wheeling bridge case have repeatedly been followed by the supreme court as well as by lower federal and state courts.fed,ry.emps dep,afl cio wright,holding that it is an abuse of discretion not to modify an injunction when,because of a change in the law,t he parties have no power to require of the court continuing enforcement of rights the statute no longer gives see also,cobell norton,d.vacating injunction where subsequently enacted legislation relieved executive department of duties required by injunction because an injunction may be a final judgment for purposes of appeal,but it is not the last word of the judicial department because any provision of prospective relief is subject to the continuing supervisory jurisdiction of the court,and therefore may be altered according to subsequent changes in the law quoting coal.to save our mall norton,internal quotation marks omitted in original quoting miller french,biodiversity assocs.cables,cir injunction arising from settlement agreement must give way because it was inconsistent with new legislation imprisoned citizens union ridge,cir wheeling bridge therefore stands for the proposition that when congress changes the law underlying a judgment awarding prospective injunctive relief,the judgment becomes void to the extent that it is inconsistent with the amended law.
those principles reflect the fact that a continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as events may shape the need a court does not abdicate its power to revoke or modify its mandate,if satisfied that what it has been doing has been turned through changing circumstances into an instrument of wrong.united states swift,see also salazar buono,where legislative action has undermined the basis upon which relief has previously been granted,a court must consider whether the original finding of wrongdoing continues to justify the court intervention.citing wright,at and wheeling bridge,at.
our court has applied these principles to an injunction barring infringement of patents later found to be invalid.mendenhall barber greene.in mendenhall,we reviewed injunctions based on findings of patent infringement.id.at.while those injunctions were pending on appeal,the same patents were held invalid in another case in our court.id.at.we held that the injunctions had to be reversed following the final judgment of patent invalidity.id.at.we recognized that upholding injunctions would be anomalous in the extreme in connection with patents this court has just held invalid.id.at.
under these authorities,there is no longer any legal basis to enjoin lawson conduct based on rights that claim of the patent previously conferred as those rights have ceased to exist.the pto found claim invalid,we affirmed that decision,our mandate issued,and the pto cancelled the claim.claim no longer confers any rights that support an injunction against infringement.during oral argument,eplus even admitted that there could be no injunction moving forward.the pto cancellation of claim requires that we now vacate the injunction.
ii.civil contempt remedies 
the second question is whether the civil contempt sanctions should be set aside.it is well established that v iolations of an order are punishable as criminal contempt even though the order is set aside on appeal or though the basic action has become moot.united states united mine workers of,citing worden searls,gompers buck stove range,see also walker birmingham,upholding criminal contempt sentences for violation of injunction regardless of the validity of the injunction howat state of kansas,criminal contempt sentences do not depend on constitutionality of law on which injunction is based.if lawson had been found guilty of criminal contempt,that order and any resulting penalties would not be set aside simply because claim had been cancelled.
however,the district court found lawson in civil,not criminal,contempt.it awarded compensation to eplus for economic injury during the period that the injunction was in effect,based on the supreme court decision in leman krentler arnold hinge last.in leman,the court upheld an award of the infringer profits not by way of punishment but to insure full compensation.id.at the rule for civil contempt is that t he right to remedial relief falls with an injunction which events prove was erroneously issued.united mine workers,at citing worden,at,salvage process,at anargyros anargyros.the supreme court distinguished civil from criminal contempt,explaining that 
it does not follow,of course,that simply because a defendant may be punished for criminal contempt for disobedience of an order later set aside on appeal,that the plaintiff in the action may profit by way of a fine imposed in a simultaneous proceeding for civil contempt based upon a violation of the same order.
id.at.the court explained that if the injunction had been overturned,the conviction for civil contempt would be reversed in its entirety.id.at.a party right,as a civil litigant,to the civil compensatory fine is dependent upon the outcome of the basic controversy.id.at.civil contempt sanctions must be set aside when the resolution of the case requires overturning the injunction on which those sanctions are based.
the supreme court has specifically applied this rule to set aside civil contempt sanctions imposed for violating an injunction based on patents subsequently found to be invalid.worden,at in worden,the district court had declared the patent not invalid,found the defendants liable for infringement,and ordered a permanent injunction.id.at.the court also found the defendants in contempt of its preliminary injunction and ordered them to pay fines for civil contempt.id.at.the defendants appealed the court rulings on infringement and validity,as well as the contempt order and resulting fines.id.at.on appeal,the supreme court found the patent invalid and,on that basis,vacated the injunction.id.at.because the court found the patent invalid,id.at,and reversed the injunction on appeal,id.at,it set aside the civil contempt order and resulting fines,declaring that the sanctions can not be upheld.id.the court explained that the civil sanctions were incidents of the patentee claims in the suit.his right to them was,if it existed at all,founded on his right to the injunction,and that was founded on the validity of his patent.id.at.under worden,compensatory civil contempt remedies must be set aside when the injunction on which they are based is set aside because the patent is determined to be invalid other circuits have similarly held that civil contempt sanctions must be set aside if the underlying injunction is reversed on appeal 
this case is not distinguishable on the ground that the injunction has been set aside as the result of the pto proceeding rather than a court judgment.in fresenius usa,baxter international,we held that a money judgment of damages for infringement must be set aside where the judgment rested on a patent claim that the pto later cancelled,we held that the cancellation of a patent requires that judgments be set aside because the cancelled claims a re void ab initio,id.at,relying on moffit garr,where the supreme court held that unless the patent exists,and is in force at the time of trial and judgment,the suits fail.id.at quoting moffit,at.thus,the cancellation of the patent precluded the patentee from recovering damages in fresenius.similarly,here the civil contempt sanctions must be set aside.
this case does not require us to decide whether civil contempt sanctions would survive if the injunction had been final at the time the district court imposed civil contempt sanctions the injunction here was not final even though claim had been held infringed.we held in fresenius that even if this court has rejected an invalidity defense to infringement,an intervening decision invalidating the patents unquestionably applies as long as the judgment in the present litigation is not final.id.at see also moffit,at p ending suits fall with the surrender of a patent which,in judgment of law,extinguishes the patent.mendenhall,at because the mendenhall patents are invalid,the plaintiffs can not now enjoin or recover damages from these defendants.in fresenius,we had previously reviewed the district court rulings on infringement and invalidity and remanded the case to the district court to determine the scope of damages and injunctive relief.at.when reviewing the judgment reached by the district court on remand,we held that the original district court judgment,while final for purposes of appeal was not sufficiently final to preclude application of the intervening judgment that led to the cancellation of the patent.id.at.with respect to the determination of finality,we explained that where the scope of relief remains to be determined,there is no final judgment binding the parties or the court.id.at.this rule follows from the supreme court holding that a final decree is one that finally adjudicates upon the entire merits,leaving nothing further to be done except the execution of it.john simmons grier.
there is no question here that the district court modified injunction was not final when the pto cancelled claim.our previous appeal did not affirm the injunction,rather it remanded the case to the district court,requiring it to consider what changes are required to the terms of the injunction,consistent with this opinion.eplus i,at.our decision necessitated changes to the injunction because of our reversal of the infringement findings under claims and,and our conclusion that configuration was not infringing.on remand,the district court had to consider the scope of relief to which eplus was entitled,which necessarily impacted what activities lawson could undertake.the district court ordered the parties to file statements of position respecting the effect,if any,of the decision of the court of appeals on the scope of the injunction previously entered.eplus,lawson software,order,ecf.in light of those submissions,the court recognized that it is appropriate to reassess the propriety and scope of an injunction,as directed by the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.eplus,lawson software,cv,order,ecf.
on the remand as on appeal,lawson argued that our ruling required more than eliminating the reference to configuration.specifically,lawson contended that it was necessary to alter the injunction as to sales of products.lawson also asserted that the requisite ebay analysis for the injunction changed because configurations and were used by a substantially smaller portion of its customer base than configuration.the district court rejected lawson arguments and found that the only change our mandate required was removing the provision of the injunction that referenced configuration.consequently,it issued an order modifying the injunction in this one respect.the court ordered that p ursuant to the mandate of the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit it is hereby ordered that the injunction is modified by deleting from its scope the product colloquially known as configuration.lawson appealed the modification on the ground that it was not sufficient or consistent with our mandate and did not make the required changes.under these circumstances,as in fresenius,the district court order was not final.at.after the district court modified the injunction,lawson appealed the modification under a.that appeal was pending when the pto cancelled the only claim at issue in the litigation.
eplus asserts that lawson viewed the injunction as final because it filed a rule b motion asking the district court to modify or dissolve the modified injunction.the filing of a rule b motion under such circumstances is not unusual.filing a rule b motion did not prevent lawson from appealing the modified injunction in addition to appealing the denial of the rule b motion.see stone,either before or after filing his appeal,the litigant may also file a rule b motion for relief with the district court.the denial of the rule b motion is appealable as a separate final order,and if the original appeal is still pending the court of appeals can consolidate the proceedings.
we conclude that the compensatory award for the violation of the injunction must be set aside in light of the cancellation of claim.given our disposition,we need not reach the question of whether lawson redesigned products are more than colorably different from the original accused products and whether the redesigned products infringe.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the district court injunction and contempt orders are vacated.the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss.
vacated and remanded.
i agree that,once this court affirmed the pto cancellation of claim of the patent,an ongoing injunction barring infringement of that patent could no longer stand and must be vacated prospectively.that conclusion comes easily as the majority notes,even appellant counsel conceded the point during oral argument.op.at.the more difficult question is whether appellees are relieved of all penalties for having violated the injunction during the four years it was in place before the pto cancellation was affirmed 
on this second question,the majority concludes that t his case does not require us to decide whether civil contempt sanctions would survive if the injunction had been final at the time the district court imposed civil contempt sanctions,op.at,because,under fresenius usa,baxter international,fresenius ii,cancellation of claims by the patent and trademark office pto requires that judgments be set aside.op.at.because it finds the judgment in this case nonfinal,the the strength of fresenius ii renders all aspects of the earlier judgment against lawson,including the injunction premised thereon,a nullity.i respectfully dissent from that aspect of the majority opinion because fresenius ii is distinguishable from,and i do not believe governs,the present appeal.i write separately,moreover,to note that,if we are bound by fresenius ii on these facts,i find fresenius ii even more troubling than i initially believed.fresenius usa,baxter int l,dissenting from denial of petition for rehearing en banc.
in fresenius ii,a panel of this court held that cancellation of claims during reexamination would be binding in concurrent litigation,and,while cancellation of a patent claims can not be used to reopen a final damages judgment ending a suit based on those claims,there can be no final judgment binding the parties where the scope of relief remains to be determined.at,emphasis added.the facts here are different than those before us in fresenius ii.
in the initial district court litigation between fresenius and baxter,fresenius brought suit seeking a declaratory judgment that the claims of three patents were invalid and not infringed by fresenius hemodialysis machines.fresenius usa,baxter int,fresenius i.the district court granted baxter judgment as a matter of law,finding that the jury obviousness verdict was not supported by substantial evidence.id.after a separate jury trial on damages,the jury awarded baxter over million in damages.id.at.the district court issued a permanent injunction against fresenius,but delayed implementation of the injunction to allow fresenius time to develop a machine.id.in lieu of the immediate injunction,the district court ordered fresenius to pay an royalty for any infringing machines sold prior to the injunction taking effect.id.fresenius appealed the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law regarding validity,the permanent injunction,the ongoing royalty award,and claim construction.id.fresenius,however,did not appeal the damages award,only the prospective royalties and injunction.
in fresenius i,we reversed the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law for all but six claims of one of baxter patents.id.at.for those six claims,we held that fresenius failed to prove invalidity.id.we remanded to the district court with the following instruction w e vacate the injunction and remand so that the court may revise or reconsider the injunction in light of the fact that only claims of the patent remain valid and infringed.finally,we vacate the royalty award entered by the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.id.
on remand,fresenius argued that no injunction should issue,the ongoing royalty amount was unreasonable,and it should receive a new trial for preverdict damages for infringement of the patent.fresenius ii,at.the district court declined to enter an injunction as the relevant patent had expired,awarded baxter new damages at a reduced royalty,and denied fresenius motion for a new preverdict damages trial.id.while fresenius second appeal was pending,we affirmed a decision of the pto cancelling the remaining claims of the patent in an ex parte reexamination proceeding.in re baxter int l.the fresenius ii panel concluded that,because we vacated the injunction and the royalty award,and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion in fresenius i,f d at,the litigation was not final as we left the district court with more to do than simply execute the judgment.fresenius ii,at.because the scope of relief remain ed to be determined,there was no final judgment binding the parties,the reexamination extinguishe d the underlying basis for suits based on the patent,and we vacated the damages award.id.at.
the facts of the present appeal differ markedly from those presented in fresenius ii.at trial in this case,the jury found that configurations and were not infringing configurations,and infringed system claim of the patent configurations and infringed system claim of the patent and method claims,and of the patent and lawson did not infringe the patent.eplus,lawson software,wl,at.may.the jury also concluded that none of the asserted claims were invalid.id.the district court entered a permanent injunction against lawson,preventing lawson from making,using,selling,or offering to sell,configurations,or.id.at eplus then initiated contempt proceedings against lawson,arguing that the designaround rqc module was not more than colorably different from the infringing rss module.eplus,lawson software.
lawson appealed the validity of the two system claims,the jury infringement findings as to all claims,and the district court entry of an injunction.eplus i,at.importantly,lawson did not appeal the validity determinations regarding claims,and of the patent.we concluded that the system claims were invalid as indefinite,and reversed the district court denial of judgment as a matter of law for noninfringement of claims and of the patent.id.at.we affirmed,however,the jury finding of infringement of claim of the patent we returned the case to the district court with a very limited remand instruction we remand to the district court to consider what changes are required to the terms of the injunction,consistent with this opinion.in all other respects,we affirm.id.our remand instruction merely recognized the district court inherent continuing equitable powers over the scope of its injunction.importantly,neither our opinion nor our remand instruction vacated the injunction.the judgment that claim was valid and infringed one of the judgments upon which the injunction was predicated remained intact,as did the injunction.
on remand,lawson moved to modify or vacate the injunction under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court concluded that the injunction must be modified so as to no longer apply to configuration.the injunction shall remain in effect in all other respects.eplus,lawson software,d,also holding that aspects of the injunction related to configuration and remain undisturbed by the federal circuit decision.thus,the only modification necessary under our remand instruction consistent with our opinion was that configuration had to be removed from the scope of the injunction as claim of the patent,the sole basis for infringement by configuration,was held invalid.id.lawson never contended that the number of claims of the patent that were infringed would or should impact the scope of the products enjoined,or even that the number of patents infringed by the same products was material to the nature of the injunctive relief.id.at noting that lawson sought to alter the scope of the injunction only on the basis that just method claims remained infringed after eplus i,and only lawson customers would be affected by the injunction.thus,while reference to configuration was removed from the injunction,the activities enjoined did not change.id.at.separately,the district court concluded that lawson had been in contempt of the injunction since soon after it was entered,and awarded eplus disgorgement of lawson profits.eplus,lawson software,d.lawson appealed the district court contempt order and ruling on the rule b motion.
there are crucial differences between these facts and the facts in fresenius ii.first,fresenius failed to appeal the damages judgment from the district court,but did appeal the validity of all relevant.as the pto reexamination determination involved the validity of some of the,fresenius at least continued to press the validity of the patents in its first appeal.further,while fresenius did not directly appeal the damages award in fresenius i,it did move for a new trial on damages on remand premised on the further proceedings language in our remand instruction,which it then appealed in fresenius ii.in the present appeal,lawson never appealed the validity of claim of the patent and never sought to press the issue again,either before the trial court or this one.the judgment that claim of the patent was valid became final when the district court entered final judgment and lawson chose not to appeal that judgment to this court.while the pto did find claim of the patent to be invalid through ex parte reexamination proceedings,and we affirmed that decision in in re eplus,app x,the validity of claim of the patent as between eplus and lawson with regards to the continuing injunction at least until the decision in in re eplus mandated was final well before that point in time.see function media,kappos,app x,holding that a party failure to appeal from a district court judgment of no invalidity barred that party from seeking reexamination of those claims odectics,storage tech,holding that failure of a party to the issue of validity preclud ed further consideration of the issue volvo trademark holding aktiebolaget clark mach,cir the mandate rule forecloses litigation of issues decided by the district court but foregone on appeal bullen de bretteville,cir,overruled on other grounds,lacey maricopa,cir a case remanded for further hearing or over which jurisdiction is retained for some purposes may nonetheless be final as to other issues determined.
second,the remand instructions in eplus i and fresenius i were different in important,material respects.in fresenius i,we vacated the injunction and the postverdict royalty awards,instructed the district court to revise or reconsider the injunction,and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.fresenius i,at.by vacating the injunction,we required the district court to analyze the injunction anew.further,in fresenius ii we found that,by remanding for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,the district court was free to consider other aspects of the case,including fresenius motion for a new trial regarding damages.here,we did not vacate the injunction,which was the only form of remedy available to eplus.by not vacating the injunction,the injunction remained in force and any infringing activity by lawson would be potential contemptible conduct.we did no more than suggest that the district court consider any necessary changes to the injunction,consistent with the district court equitable powers we did not direct the district court to revise or reconsider the injunction.finally,we conspicuously did not remand for any further proceedings consistent with this opinion.as the majority in fresenius ii recognized in distinguishing qualcomm,fcc,the scope of the appellate remand instruction is crucial to the preclusive effect of an intervening pto reexamination determination.fresenius ii,at.
the fresenius ii majority concluded that the remand instruction in qualcomm was for specific,immediate relief for a party,while it found the remand instruction in fresenius i more for further proceedings.id.the remand instruction in eplus i,like that in qualcomm,did contemplate specific,immediate relief for a party configuration should be removed from the scope of the injunction,but the injunction remains in force subject only to the district court continuing equitable power over it.and,the remand instruction in eplus i noticeably does not include an order for the district court to undertake further proceedings.fresenius i,at.thus,as the fresenius ii majority contemplated when attempting to distinguish the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia apparently contrary ruling in qualcomm,the more limited scope of the remand order from eplus i differentiates the present appeal from that in fresenius ii.
finally,the nature of the remedies at issue on appeal distinguishes the two cases.in fresenius ii,the majority determined that both and damages would be vacated in light of the pto reexamination results because the scope of monetary remedies was not yet final.that is not the case here.as noted,i agree with the majority that the injunction should be vacated prospectively from the date when in re eplus mandated,and that any coercive civil remedies should be vacated since it would be inappropriate to force lawson to comply with an injunction that is no longer enforceable.as the majority correctly states,an injunction is a continuing decree that must not be enforced prospectively if the right underlying the decree is abrogated.op.at quoting pennsylvania.wheeling belmont bridge,how.i disagree,however,that the results of in re eplus require that we vacate the compensatory civil contempt order.
lawson conduct giving rise to the contempt order occurred while the injunction,with regards to configurations and,was valid under eplus i.while we remanded to allow the district court to use its inherent equitable powers to remove configuration from the scope of the injunction,we retained the jury infringement finding with regards to claim of the patent,lawson did not appeal the validity of claim,and we did not vacate the injunction.in a contempt proceeding,the putative contemnor may not challenge the correctness of the underlying order or attack the validity of the underlying basis for an injunction unless the court issuing the injunction had no jurisdiction to do so maggio zeitz,proveris scientific innovasystems,in a contempt proceeding to enforce an injunction,the only available defense for anyone bound by the injunction was that the newly accused product did not infringe validity and infringement by the original device were not open to challenge.quoting additive controls measurement,flowdata.all that remained available for review in the current appeal was the prospective validity of the injunction and the propriety of findings made during the contempt proceeding,not the underlying basis for the injunction at issue in the contempt proceeding.thus,the underlying basis of the contempt award,which is the only aspect of the contempt proceeding that could be influenced by the results of in re eplus,was not at issue during the district court contempt proceedings,and is not at issue in this appeal.
for these reasons,i believe that the majority incorrectly holds that fresenius ii requires that we to vacate the compensatory contempt award in light of in re eplus 
if the majority is correct that fresenius ii requires us to vacate the compensatory contempt award,even though lawson failed to appeal the judgment finding claim of the patent valid and even though we did not vacate the injunction or remand for proceedings,then fresenius ii is even more concerning than i first believed.i continue to believe that we wrongly decided fresenius ii.as detailed in my dissent to the denial of the petition for rehearing en banc,fresenius ii,at,dissenting from denial of petition for rehearing en banc,the majority in fresenius ii erroneously analyzed both the finality of the issues on appeal and the scope of our appellate remand instruction in fresenius i.these arguments apply with even greater force and urgency here.
the majority approach to finality will further displace the critical role of district courts in patent infringement suits.according to the majority,a decision of the pto,an administrative agency under a coordinate branch of government,can displace a judgment of an article iii court.validity of claim became final when lawson failed to appeal the issue in eplus i and our disposition did not reopen the judgment for any further proceedings regarding the validity of any of the,nor did it leave the remedy open in the sense fresenius ii said fresenius i did.by extending fresenius ii to these materially different circumstances,the majority assumes that any determination made during an infringement case,even if that specific issue is never appealed,can be nullified by the action of an administrative agency as long as anything even a fully discretionary consideration of an intact remedy remain
