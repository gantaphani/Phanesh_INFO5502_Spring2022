petitioner,inland counties regional center,irc,helps coordinate care and services for individuals with developmental disabilities.see,cal.code,tit,subd.a.the trial court in this case ordered irc to assess the competency of real party in interest,adan omar barajas barajas,to stand trial on criminal charges and then,when irc failed to comply,held it in contempt and imposed monetary sanctions against it.because we agree with irc that this order was unjustified,we grant the petition.
factual and procedural background 
on february,the people filed a felony complaint charging barajas with vehicle theft veh.code,subd.a,knowingly obtaining a stolen vehicle pen.code,subd.a,driving under the influence veh.code,subd.e,and possession of paraphernalia used for smoking a controlled substance health saf.code.barajas pled guilty to the vehicle theft and driving under the influence counts on february,and the other counts were dismissed.the trial court sentenced him to probation.
barajas then allegedly violated probation,causing the trial court to issue a bench warrant on june.on july,the deputy public defender appointed to represent barajas requested a competency evaluation under penal code section.the court granted the motion and appointed patricia kirkish,to conduct an evaluation.on august,kirkish produced a report opining that barajas lacked competency to stand trial,possibly due to a cognitive impairment.
on september,the trial court,after reading kirkish report,found barajas to be incompetent to stand trial and suspended criminal proceedings against him.it ordered a placement evaluation,which was provided on september.on september,the trial court held a hearing regarding barajas placement recommendation and issued a minute order reading,as relevant to this petition court has read and considered placement evaluation.court orders inland regional center to provide a determination as to whether or not the defendant is incompetent due to developmental disabilities pursuant to of the penal code.inland regional center to provide a report to the court on or before.
irc responded by sending the trial judge a confidential letter on october,indicating that it could not perform a competency evaluation of barajas unless it was first determined that he was eligible for irc services by virtue of having a developmental disability.the letter indicated irc would,in fact,perform the evaluation,but if and only if barajas was found to have a developmental disability.it also asked for a certified minute order providing access to barajas and to his medical records.
on october,the date set for production of the report irc was ordered to provide on september,the trial court again held a hearing regarding barajas placement.the minute order the trial court issued reads,in relevant part court orders inland regional to perform an evaluation pursuant to of the penal code.evaluation returnable on.if no report is returned to the court on or before the court orders a representative of inland regional to appear before the court and justify why inland regional center should not be held in contempt of court.
irc again responded with a confidential letter on november,explaining its position that it could not evaluate competency unless and until it determined that barajas had a developmental disability.to this letter,irc attached another letter,this one dated july,in which it explained to local courts and the agencies providing attorney representation in criminal cases that it would no longer be conducting competency evaluations unless or until the defendant is found eligible for regional center services by a regional center.in the november,letter,irc repeated its request for a certified minute order granting access to barajas,and access to his medical records.it also expressed a need for his school records and evaluations prior to age and requested eight weeks to complete its eligibility evaluation report.
the parties appeared for another hearing on november.the trial court began by confirming that it intended to hold a contempt proceeding after verifying that irc had not,in fact,prepared a report regarding barajas competency to stand trial.when describing the case procedural history,the court explained when i was rereading kirkish report,two things jumped out at me.number one,is that barajas appears to have been the victim of some traumatic brain injury,perhaps around the age of.but,more importantly,he also reported being in special education classes in the grade and having a very difficult time succeeding to the point where,i believe,he had to be home schooled by a n uncle.when i read both of those things in conjunction,i had a suspicion that the incompetence was due to a developmental disability.therefore,pursuant to penal code section,subdivision a,i entered an order on september the of this year to the inland regional center to determine whether or not the defendant is incompetent,due to the developmental disability pursuant to penal code section.the trial court then characterized irc first confidential letter as essentially stating there had been an illegal court order,and the second as essentially stating that irc is not going to comply with the court order.
irc counsel referred the trial court to the november,letter,which relied on several sections in the welfare and institutions code as authority supporting the position that irc could not commit to doing more than assessing barajas for a developmental disability at that time.the trial court responded that penal code section,subdivision a,stands apart from those statutes and then cited people leonard cal th leonard as support for the idea that the experts who evaluated barajas competency should have experience with developmental disability.in concluding,the trial noted that penal code section specifically refers to a suspicion by the courts,and then stated i have a suspicion based on the information contained in kirkish report.therefore,pursuant to,subdivision a i made the order,which appears to be a valid order.so,my intention at this point is to hold irc in contempt.
the trial court then found petitioner in contempt of court,imposed sanctions of,and stayed the order for days to allow petitioner to seek appellate review.this petition followed on november.
the next day,we issued an order requesting an informal response and staying the action.after receiving an informal response from barajas,a letter stating the people would not be responding to the petition,and a reply,we issued an order to show cause on december.on december,barajas filed a return,in which he argued the contempt order was lawful,in part because the court had,by that point in time,already found that real party was incompetent due to a mental illness or developmental disability.barajas further accused the petition of asking the court to legislate from the bench by suggesting that the statutory timeframe established for an initial assessment for services by a regional center for the developmentally disabled welf.inst.code,subd.a also sets limits on the time in which a court may order a regional center to complete an evaluation into a criminal defendant competency to stand trial.on january,irc filed a traverse responding to these contentions.
barajas then moved to withdraw the return on january.his counsel explained that,after reading the transcripts and minute orders of the hearings described ante,she concluded the court order seems unlawful because irc can not be ordered to perform a full competency evaluation unless barajas is found to actually have a developmental disability.a footnote on the last page of the motion states in light of barajas change in position,this court need not resolve whether the timeframe of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a applies to assessments of incompetent criminal defendants under penal code section,subdivision a.
barajas cites,and we are aware of,no authority allowing a party to withdraw a return that has been filed with the court.a clerk of the court has a duty to safely keep or dispose of according to law all papers and records filed or deposited in any action or proceeding before the court code,and we will not interfere with performance of this function by ordering a previously filed document withdrawn rather than replaced with a brief that better reflects barajas current response to the petition.instead,we will deny the motion to withdraw the return and deem barajas to have waived any objections to the timeframe in which irc assesses him.
in addition,irc requests judicial notice of an amicus brief the california department of developmental services dds filed in leonard at the request of the california supreme court.leonard,supra,cal th at,fn.barajas makes no objection to our granting the request.as the dds letter provides helpful information about the way in which irc functions,we grant irc request for judicial notice of dds amicus brief from leonard.evid.code.
discussion 
contempt judgments and orders are final and conclusive.code civ.nonetheless,review will lie by certiorari.in re buckley cal d.a reviewing court may,in such a proceeding,examine the allegations of contemptuous acts alleged to determine if they do in fact constitute contemptuous acts sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to punish petitioner for contempt,and the review may extend to the whole of the record of the court below where it is necessary to determine the jurisdictional fact.chula superior court d,chula.
a trial court may take action to punish contempt under section of the code of civil procedure.the elements of proof necessary to support punishment for contempt are a valid court order,the alleged contemnor knowledge of the order,and noncompliance.citations.the order must be clear,specific,and unequivocal.citation.any ambiguity in a decree or order must be resolved in favor of an alleged contemnor.citation.in writ proceedings to review an adjudication of contempt,our inquiry is whether there was any substantial evidence before the trial court to prove the elements of the contempt.absent such evidence,the order must be annulled.in re marcus th,fn.omitted marcus.
in this case,we conclude there was no contemptuous act sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to punish petitioner for contempt.chula,supra,d at.first,and on a relatively general level,we note it appears the trial court found irc in contempt because it and irc counsel disagreed about the interpretation of both penal code section and of leonard.while a court has inherent power to punish for contempt,this is a drastic remedy which should be used only when necessary in order to maintain law and order.it should rarely,if ever,be used for the purpose of settling differences of opinion between conscientious officials with respect to close questions of civil law.whether or not the power to do so technically existed here,in our opinion it was an abuse of discretion to punish the petitioner for contempt under these circumstances.uhler superior court d.
second,our review of the specifics of this petition leads us to conclude that the trial court lacked the ability to find irc in contempt because the order requiring petitioner to fully evaluate barajas competency was not a valid court order.marcus,supra,th at.we now explain why this is so.
with exceptions not relevant to this proceeding,dds has jurisdiction over the execution of the laws relating to the care,custody,and treatment of developmentally disabled persons.welf.inst.code.in the amicus brief it filed in leonard,dds itself explained services are rendered to persons with developmental disabilities referred to in the lanterman act as consumers through a unique administrative structure incorporating private and public institutions.the act creates regional centers rc,operated by private,nonprofit community agencies under contract with dds.rc,not dds,determine eligibility,services to be rendered and arrange for their delivery.welf.inst.code.irc is one of the regional centers charged with determining eligibility and arranging for delivery of services.
dds amicus brief continues rc are required to conduct a comprehensive assessment of persons who are potentially eligible for services.welf.inst.code.rc review diagnostic data and provide or procure necessary tests and evaluations,including intelligence tests,adaptive functioning tests,neurological and neuropsychological tests,diagnostic tests performed by a physician,psychiatric tests,and other tests or evaluations that have been performed by,and are available from,other sources.dds then explains that assessing a person for developmental disability is a multilayered process that occurs in steps.it often requires both standardized testing and interviews with people familiar with the individual being assessed,and it requires an exercise of clinical judgment,which is defined as a special type of judgment rooted in a high level of clinical expertise and experience it emerges directly from extensive data.it is based on the clinician explicit training,direct experience with people who have mental retardation,and familiarity with the person and the person environments.
any california resident believed to have a developmental disability may apply to a regional center for initial intake,diagnostic and counseling services,and a determination regarding the need for assessment.cal.code,tit,subd.a.after that,eligibility for ongoing regional center services shall be contingent upon the determination,after intake and assessment,that the person has a developmental disability that constitutes a substantial disability.cal.code,tit,subd.b.in addition to dds amicus brief,previous authority from this court confirms that the assessment of whether an individual has a developmental disability is a task reserved for a regional center.mason office of admin.hearings th.
this petition asks us to probe the intersection between dds system of having regional centers assess and manage services for persons with developmental disabilities and the system by which courts process cases involving criminal defendants who are or are suspected to be incompetent to stand trial.we provide the following as a brief background on the latter.
penal code section,subdivision a,prohibits the trial of a criminal defendant who,as a result of mental disorder or developmental disability is unable to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner.subdivision b of the same statute explains that penal code section applies to a defendant who is charged with a felony and found incompetent as a result of a mental disorder,while penal code s ection shall apply to a person who is incompetent as a result of a developmental disability and shall apply to a person who is incompetent as a result of a mental disorder,but is also developmentally disabled.
if a trial judge develops a doubt about the mental competence of a criminal defendant prior to judgment,the judge is to ask the defendant counsel for an opinion regarding competency pen.code,subd.a.the trial court is to order a hearing in accordance with,as relevant to this petition,penal code section if counsel indicates he or she believes the defendant is incompetent.pen.code,subd.b.t he court may nevertheless order a hearing,even if counsel expresses a belief that the defendant is competent.ibid.if the trial court sets a hearing regarding competency,all proceedings in the criminal prosecution shall be suspended until the question of the present mental competence of the defendant has been determined.pen.code,subd.c.
penal code section governs proceedings on the issue of a criminal defendant competency to stand trial and is the crux of this petition.the portion of the statute that is the most relevant to our concerns reads the court shall appoint a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist,and any other expert the court may deem appropriate,to examine the defendant.in any case where the defendant or the defendant counsel informs the court that the defendant is not seeking a finding of mental incompetence,the court shall appoint two psychiatrists,licensed psychologists,or a combination thereof.one of the psychiatrist
