lila rizk appeals her jury conviction for one count of conspiracy in violation of one count of bank fraud in violation of and thirteen counts of loan fraud in violation of.rizk contends that the district court committed prejudicial error by admitting two summary charts under federal rule of evidence.rizk also contends that there was insufficient evidence to support each of her convictions.rizk further contends that the district court erred in ordering her to pay restitution in the full amount of the victim lenders loss,despite a prior civil settlement with the victim lenders that included a release from liability.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
lila rizk was a licensed real estate appraiser based in orange county,california.she did business with mark abrams,a mortgage broker,and his business partner charles elliott fitzgerald,a real estate developer.between july and january,abrams,fitzgerald,and others associated with them initiated and carried out a scheme to defraud mortgage lenders.abrams and fitzgerald purchased homes in exclusive california communities at or near their true market values.in the purchase contracts they required sellers and their agents to keep the purchase prices confidential.abrams and fitzgerald then applied for loans in amounts far greater than the actual purchase prices.to deceive mortgage lenders into believing the loans were adequately secured by the properties,abrams,fitzgerald,and their associates made phony purchase contracts and gained inflated appraisal reports for the homes.relying on this false documentation,mortgage lenders funded and bought loans in amounts exceeding the homes actual purchase prices and market values.as a result,abrams and fitzgerald made,while the defrauded victim lenders lost,millions of dollars.losses to these lenders in total exceeded million.
rizk actively participated in the mortgage fraud scheme.the lenders required appraisals before they would approve home loans.the appraisals generated by rizk made the homes appear to be worth much more than their true values.the lenders relied on rizk inflated appraisals in funding and buying the loans.in providing the inflated appraisals,rizk followed an array of improper and practices.rizk improperly ignored the original sellers list prices,often hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars less than her appraisals.rizk did not use genuinely comparable properties.rizk used as comparable properties homes that were distant from,differed from,or had sold long before the homes being appraised.rizk also used homes,for which she had previously given inflated appraisals,as comparable properties.both from the improper acts that she did in fashioning appraisals,and from her failure to use appropriate practices in determining market values of comparable properties,there was abundant evidence that rizk did not exercise an independent professional judgment in making her appraisals for abrams and fitzgerald.
before trial,the government moved in limine to introduce charts summarizing the properties involved in the scheme.the charts listed properties in chronological order of the corresponding loan transactions.the first chart showed the following data for each property the actual escrow closing date and the date reported to the lender the actual sale price and the price reported to the lender the amount of the loan funded whether the real estate agents who participated in the scheme received a commission if so,how much the named appraisers on the appraisals submitted to the lender and whether rizk provided records about the transaction to the government under subpoena.
the second chart showed the following data for each property the appraisal date the appraisal value submitted to the lender the named appraisers on the appraisals submitted to the lender and the addresses of comparable properties used in the appraisal.this chart used to show how rizk used properties she had previously appraised at inflated values as comparables in later appraisals.
the district court granted the government motion,concluding over objection that the charts were admissible under federal rule of evidence.rizk and her had argued that the charts were overbroad,including properties not specifically named in the indictment the district court,however,accepted that the purpose of the charts was to show the full scope of the fraudulent scheme and that the indictment expressly include d more than the nine listed properties.and so the district court held that the summary evidence was within the scope of the indictment.the district court also stated that rizk and her had been given the underlying documents showing what was described in the summary charts,and that they had ample time to review them before trial.
rizk was a named appraiser in only of the transactions shown on the charts.but at trial the government presented evidence showing that rizk had prepared the appraisals for all transactions.the summary charts showed that rizk had produced records to the government regarding transactions in which she was not a named appraiser.these records included sketches,notes,emails,and at least one appraisal matching a submitted appraisal.the government introduced testimony that later in the scheme,rizk removed her name from the appraisals and substituted the names of unwitting appraisers not connected to the scheme.her testified that rizk knew and was relieved that her name was no longer being used on the appraisals.and the government showed that rizk continued to receive compensation from abrams and fitzgerald long after the submitted appraisals stopped bearing her name.
at trial,rizk admitted that her appraisals were too high,but argued that she made them in good faith and that she lacked knowledge of the conspiracy.rizk argued that abrams exploited her because she was based in orange county and did know los angeles,beverly hills,or bel air,which housed the subject properties she appraised.she said that the only sale price she was given for a property was the falsified,inflated sale price not the true sale price kept confidential and that she used the price she was given as her starting point.she said that abrams gave her the deficient comparable properties and misrepresented them to her,that she believed abrams was credible,and that she did not know she was using bad comparables.rizk also contested the government proffer that she had performed the appraisals in all transactions listed on the summary charts.she claimed that for some properties,abrams,fitzgerald,and their associates had produced the appraisals and forged her name.in short,rizk defense was that despite her failure to perform the due diligence required of her in making the appraisals,she did not knowingly participate in the scheme,and lacked the required intent to support a conviction for conspiracy,bank fraud,and loan fraud.
from the evidence presented to it,the jury might have viewed rizk as a key and knowing participant in a deliberate fraud,or as an innocent and unknowing dupe used and manipulated by the ringleaders of the fraud.however,the jury did not believe rizk account.it found her guilty on all counts.
rizk then filed a motion for acquittal,which the district court denied.the district court sentenced rizk to a prison term,to be followed by a term of supervised release,and it ordered forfeiture and restitution.pursuant to the mandatory victim restitution act,et,the district court ordered restitution in the total amount of the victims loss.this restitution order did not account for a prior civil settlement between rizk and the victim lenders,in which the victim lenders agreed to release all claims against rizk in consideration of her payment of,which was the limit of her errors and omissions insurance policy.the district court entered judgment and rizk timely appealed.
we address in turn rizk contentions on appeal.
rizk challenges the admission of the charts summarizing the real estate transactions involved in the fraud scheme.first,she contends that the charts let the government put facts before the jury without presenting evidence of those facts.second,she complains that because the charts cover transactions not specifically referenced in the indictment,they were other acts evidence under federal rule of evidence b.third,she asserts that because the other acts evidence admitted under rule b in the charts was unfairly prejudicial,this evidence should have been excluded under federal rule of evidence.
we review a district court decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion.boyd city cnty.of,cir.
before addressing the particular challenges that rizk makes to the admission of the summary charts under federal rule of evidence,it is helpful to set forth a clear and concise statement of the rule and its underlying reason.rule provides the contents of voluminous writings,recordings,or photographs which can not conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart,summary,or calculation.the purpose of the rule is to allow the use of summaries when the documents are unmanageable or when the summaries would be useful to the judge and jury.davis cox summa,cir,superseded by statute,as recognized in northrop triad int l mktg,cir.
a proponent of summary evidence must establish that the underlying materials upon which the summary is based are admissible in evidence and were made available to the opposing party for inspection.amarel connell,cir.these materials must be admissible,but need not themselves be admitted into evidence.united states meyers,cir.the availability requirement ensures that the opposing party has an opportunity to verify the reliability and accuracy of the summary prior to trial.paddack dave christensen,cir.
here,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the government summary charts under rule.the underlying materials for the charts were standard real estate records that were both admissible in evidence and made available to rizk for inspection.rizk does not argue that the government did not establish the two requirements for admissibility.rather,she argues that the government did not present evidence supporting the information in the charts,that it did not introduce the underlying records at trial but rizk contention is without merit because rule allows precisely what rizk labels prejudicial error.rule permits admission of summaries based on voluminous records that can not readily be presented in evidence to a jury and comprehended.it is essential that the underlying records from which the summaries are made be admissible in evidence,and available to the opposing party for inspection,but the underlying evidence does not itself have to be admitted in evidence and presented to the jury.
we review de novo whether a summary chart falls within the scope of rule b.united states soliman,cir 
rule b provides that evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is inadmissible to prove character or criminal propensity but is admissible for other purposes,such as proof of intent,plan,or knowledge.b.this rule is inapplicable,however,where the evidence the government seeks to introduce is directly related to,or inextricably intertwined with,the crime charged in the indictment.united states lillard,cir.summary evidence admitted under rule may thus be outside rule b scope.for example,in united states montgomery,cir,we held that each action listed in the government summary exhibit was inextricably intertwined with the conspiracy,and therefore not subject to rule b,because each occurred within the temporal scope of the conspiracy and comprised the conspiracy.see also soliman,at finding that summary chart was not other crimes evidence.united states robinson,cir the summary properly included all applicants rather than the named in the indictment,because information regarding all of these individuals was relevant in delineating the enormous scope of the loan fraud scheme.
the rule is well established that the government in a conspiracy case may submit proof on the full scope of the conspiracy it is not limited in its proof to the overt acts alleged in the indictment.this is consistent with our own prior precedent and that of other circuits.see,montgomery,at lillard,at united states williams,cir finding no abuse of discretion where district court admitted evidence of uncharged transactions that were closely linked to events charged in drug conspiracy united states bonanno,cir one of the charges in the indictment alleged conspiracy.in conspiracy prosecutions,the government has considerable leeway in offering evidence of other offenses not charged in the indictment.united states janati,cir it is well established that when seeking to prove a conspiracy,the government is permitted to present evidence of acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy even though they are not all specifically described in the indictment.united states powers,cir w here a conspiracy is charged,acts that are not alleged in the indictment may be admissible as part of the government proof.united states thai,cir when the indictment contains a conspiracy charge,uncharged acts may be admissible as direct evidence of the conspiracy itself.it is clear the government may offer proof of acts not included within the indictment,as long as they are within the scope of the conspiracy.internal citations and quotation marks omitted united states lewis,cir i n conspiracy cases,the government is not limited in its proof to establishing the overt acts specified in the indictment.see also united states gold,cir distinguishing evidence of facts different from those alleged in the indictment from facts which,although not specifically mentioned in the overt acts section of the indictment,are entirely consistent with its allegations.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the government summary charts were within the scope of the indictment.the real estate transactions shown on the charts were inextricably intertwined with the conspiracy charge and were not other acts subject to rule b.see lillard,at.rizk challenges the charts admission because they included transactions not specified in the indictment and appraisals not bearing her name.but the indictment alleges a conspiracy.the government offered the summary charts to show the full scope of that conspiracy and as proof that the transactions were not other acts at all that is,that rizk had prepared the appraisals for all transactions in furtherance of the conspiracy.
the district court has broad discretion to admit potentially prejudicial evidence under rule,which provides that evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.boyd,at.we generally review the application of rule for abuse of discretion.id.but where a party did not object to the district court admission on rule grounds,we review for plain error.united states plunk,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states hankey,cir.the review for plain error is even more deferential than review for abuse of discretion.under review,reversal is permitted only when there is error that is plain,affects substantial rights,and seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states cruz,cir quoting johnson united states.i n view of the inherently nature of the rule balancing inquiry,and the special deference to which district courts decisions to admit evidence pursuant to that rule are entitled,it is the rare exception when a district court decision to admit evidence under rule constitutes plain error.plunk,at internal citations omitted.
the making of rulings on disputed points of evidence is the bread and butter of trial.it comes up every day in a trial,it represents a mainstay part of the controversy,and a district court must generally make rulings quickly and on the spot to keep the proceedings fair and to move them toward completion.also,the district court has discretion in some cases properly to admit evidence subject to a limiting instruction given the jury to avoid or lessen any undue prejudice.for such reasons,it is very important that a party objecting to evidence being admitted give the court the grounds of objection.because rizk did not make a rule objection before the district court,we review this challenge to introduction of the summary charts only for plain error.
rizk contends on appeal that the district court insufficiently weighed the prejudicial effect of the summary charts.she argues that the charts comparison of true and inflated sales prices for the homes was unfairly prejudicial because it permitted the inference that for each home the appraisal was fraudulent and rizk had prepared it,though she was the named appraiser in less than half of the transactions.
to the extent that rizk rule argument is predicated on her contention that the summary charts were other acts evidence subject to rule b,we reject it.rizk relies on huddleston.united states,in which the supreme court addressed the potential prejudicial effect of rule b evidence in relation to rule.but here,because we hold that the charts were not subject to rule b,there was no danger that the jury would misuse the uncharged other acts to conclude that rizk had a criminal propensity to inflate appraisals generally.the key danger to rizk was that the jury would believe the government proof that rizk had in fact inflated the appraisals in the listed transactions.there was no rule b problem,and so her huddleston argument is unavailing.
even if we view rizk rule argument as independent of her rule b contention,we are not persuaded that she has shown grounds for relief.we have previously rejected rule challenges to the admission of summary evidence that was relevant and not unfairly prejudicial.see,montgomery,at explaining that summary exhibit was relevant because it outlined scope of conspiracy and was not unfairly prejudicial because limiting instruction was given and defendants had notice of the exhibit and an opportunity to.the same rule and practice has been followed in other circuits.see,united states boesen,cir holding that defendant suffered no unfair prejudice because charts represented accurate summaries,and evidence is not unfairly prejudicial merely because it tends to prove a defendant guilt united states seeling,cir rejecting argument that summaries more prejudicial than probative because summaries showed sales but only mentioned in indictment.
applying these principles,we conclude that a jury rationally could view the summary charts as proof of the scope of the conspiracy and of rizk broad participation in it because the charts supported the government theory that rizk prepared the appraisals in all transactions,the charts may have had impact tending to show rizk guilt,but they were not unfairly prejudicial.see seeling,at.rizk had an opportunity to inspect the documents underlying the charts,to the government witnesses who prepared them,and to argue to the jury that rizk did not prepare inflated appraisals in all transactions.see montgomery,at.because the charts probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,the district court did not err,let alone plainly err,in admitting them.
rizk argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to sustain her convictions because the government did not establish that she had knowledge of the objective of the conspiracy and that she had the requisite intent to commit bank fraud and loan fraud.after trial,rizk moved for a judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure c,and the district court denied her motion.
we review de novo the denial of rizk rule motion and her challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence the standard to be applied is the same.united states gonzalez diaz,cir united states bennett,cir.the standard of review is not favorable to rizk appellate claim.we do not retry the evidence afresh.instead,with a sufficiency of evidence challenge,we ask whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia.this leads us to consider the elements of the crimes for which rizk was convicted,and how a rational jury could view the evidence presented thereon.
to prove a conspiracy under,the government must establish an agreement to engage in criminal activity,one or more overt acts taken to implement the agreement,and the requisite intent to commit the substantive crime.united states sullivan,cir.knowledge of the objective of the conspiracy is an essential element.united states krasovich,cir.however,the government need not prove knowledge with direct evidence circumstantial evidence and the inferences drawn from that evidence can sustain a conspiracy conviction.united states wright,cir.
rizk contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish that she knew of the objective of the conspiracy.we disagree.rizk selectively identifies evidence from the record tending to show her unwitting participation in the scheme.for example,she points to testimony that her kept certain information from her related to the fraud.but the government did not have to present direct evidence that rizk knew every detail about the conspiracy.see wright,at.the government needed only to present sufficient evidence from which any rational jury could infer that rizk knew the conspiracy objective.see id.
the jury heard testimony that rizk knew her appraisals were used to gain loans on properties.abrams testified to rizk requests that actual list prices be removed from the multiple listing service database,and that properties be relisted on the database at higher prices,before she issued her inflated appraisals.evidence at trial showed that rizk appraised homes at or near values the scheme leaders asked for,and that her appraisal values far exceeded homes true market values,often by two to three hundred percent.finally,the government presented evidence that rizk prepared appraisals to be signed in the name of her scott robinson and that later in the scheme,rizk knew and was relieved that other appraisers names were being fraudulently substituted in place of her own.from this evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,a rational jury could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that rizk had knowledge of the objective of the conspiracy.
the essential elements of bank fraud under are that the defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme to defraud a financial institution that the defendant did so with the intent to defraud and that the financial institution was insured by the fdic federal deposit insurance corporation.united states warshak,cir.intent to defraud may be established by circumstantial evidence.sullivan,at holding,in mail and wire fraud case,that the scheme itself may be probative circumstantial evidence of an intent to defraud.
rizk argues that the government had to prove an additional element,intent to expose a lender to a risk of loss.she contends that there was insufficient evidence to sustain her conviction for bank fraud because the government did not do so.this circuit has never adopted a risk of loss analysis in bank fraud cases.united states wolfswinkel,cir.here,as in wolfswinkel,we need not decide whether risk of loss is an essential element of bank fraud because the government offered sufficient evidence at trial to prove that the conduct for which rizk was convicted exposed at least one bank to a risk of loss.id.rizk was an experienced appraiser.rizk knew that her appraisals were being used to finance the purchase of properties.in making her appraisals,rizk was unduly influenced by the values put forth by abrams and fitzgerald.rizk did not gain truly comparable properties to make her appraisals but instead looked at properties different in nature or location or time of sale,and eventually at her own previously inflated appraisals.an independent skilled or expert view on market values of the subject properties was missing in action.the lenders,to their detriment,relied on her appraisals.the victim lenders losses from the fraud totaled more than million.rizk had an exculpatory explanation,that she was duped and used by the fraud ringleaders.but a jury did not have to accept this view.we conclude that a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that rizk intended to defraud the lenders and to expose the
