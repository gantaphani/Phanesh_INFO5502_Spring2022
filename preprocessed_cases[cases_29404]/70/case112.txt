background 
in,koon chun sued star mark in the eastern district of new york for trademark infringement based on star mark sale of counterfeit versions of koon chun hoisin sauce,a sweet and spicy sauce used in chinese cuisine both as an ingredient in cooking and as a condiment.the district court bianco,granted partial summary judgment to koon chun,finding star mark liable for trademark and trade dress infringement.see koon chun hing kee soy sauce factory,star mark,cv jfb smg,wl,at.the parties proceeded to litigate the issues of willfulness and damages.
at a status conference in may,star mark represented by li asked for leave to amend its answer and add counterclaims seeking,inter alia,cancellation of koon chun mark on the theory that koon chun use of the word hoisin which translates to seafood was deceptive because the sauce did not contain seafood.the magistrate judge gold,expressed skepticism about the proposed claims.he said that while he had no authority to prohibit star mark from filing a motion for leave to amend,he would consider imposing sanctions if the motion were made and he deemed sanctions appropriate.star mark elected not to file its motion and instead asserted the claims in a new lawsuit,this action below.again,li represented star mark.
the remaining claims in the first lawsuit were tried.the magistrate judge found that the star mark infringement was willful and awarded damages and costs.we affirmed.see koon chun hing kee soy sauce factory,star mark,app x cir.
in the meantime,the parties proceeded with the litigation of this action.on january,koon chun counsel sent li a letter requesting that star mark withdraw the complaint and threatening to file a rule motion.attached to the letter was a proposed rule notice of motion,which listed six grounds for koon chun assertion that the lawsuit was frivolous.although the notice of motion referred to a memorandum of law and two affidavits,no such documents were attached to the notice of motion.the letter,however,contained citations to legal authorities.
star mark did not withdraw the complaint.koon chun moved for judgment on the pleadings dismissing the complaint pursuant to.c and for sanctions under and rule.the new notice of motion listed four grounds for koon chun assertion that the lawsuit was frivolous.three of these grounds were among the six listed in koon chun earlier notice of motion,attached to the letter sent to li.the fourth ground no evidence of fraud was part of the request for sanctions under.in a thorough and memorandum and order filed september,the district court matsumoto,granted both motions.star mark,koon chun hing kee soy sauce factory,cv kam smg,wl e.the district court granted the motion for sanctions under rule,not under.id.at.

discussion 
we discuss li appeal from the district court imposition of sanctions,koon chun as to the amount of the sanctions awarded,and koon chun motion to sanction li for filing a purportedly frivolous appeal.
i.the appeal 
in his appeal,li raises two principal issues a whether the service of an informal warning letter with a notice of rule motion,as opposed to a formal motion,satisfies the safe harbor requirement of.c and b whether the district court abused its discretion in concluding that plaintiffs claims were frivolous.
we review an award of rule sanctions for abuse of discretion.lawrence richman grp.of ct llc,cir per curiam.an abuse of discretion occurs when a district court base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or render s a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.kiobel millson,cir quoting sims blot,cir alterations in original.
a.the safe harbor provision 
rule provides,in pertinent part 
a motion for sanctions must be made separately from any other motion and must describe the specific conduct that allegedly violates rule b.the motion must be served under rule,but it must not be filed or be presented to the court if the challenged paper,claim,defense,contention,or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within days after service or within another time the court sets.
the advisory committee note explains 
to stress the seriousness of a motion for sanctions and to define precisely the conduct claimed to violate the rule,the revision provides that the safe harbor period begins to run only upon service of the motion.in most cases,however,counsel should be expected to give informal notice to the other party,whether in person or by a telephone call or letter,of a potential violation before proceeding to prepare and serve a rule motion.
id.advisory committee notes to amendments emphasis added.
rule and principles of due process require that the subject of a sanctions motion be informed of the source of authority for the sanctions being considered and the specific conduct or omission for which the sanctions are being considered so that the subject of the sanctions motion can prepare a defense.schlaifer nance estate of warhol,cir.indeed,only conduct explicitly referred to in the instrument providing notice is sanctionable.id.citation omitted accord storey cello holdings,cir.
the provision is a strict procedural requirement.perpetual,tang,cir see also hadges yonkers racing,cir.an informal warning in the form of a letter without service of a separate rule motion is not sufficient to trigger the day safe harbor period.foster am.piles,cir request for sanctions in letter without separate service of motion did not comply with rule requirement that sanctions motion be made separately gal viacom int l,d,t he plain language of the rule states explicitly that service of the motion itself is required to begin the safe harbor clock the rule says nothing about the use of letters.accord roth green,cir gordon unifund ccr partners,cir radcliffe rainbow constr,cir.but see nisenbaum milwaukee,cir party letter or demand sent to opposing counsel constituted substantial compliance with safe harbor provision.
here,however,koon chun did more than send a rule letter it attached to its letter a copy of its notice of motion for sanctions.after waiting the requisite days,koon chun filed its sanctions motion which included as grounds for rule sanctions several of those listed in the earlier notice with the district court.li nonetheless argues that koon chun failed to comply with the procedural requirements of rule c because it failed to serve a formal fully supported motion,appellant br.at,without any supporting legal and factual materials,appellant reply br.at.
we hold,in the circumstances here,that koon chun met the procedural requirements of the safe harbor provision of rule c by serving its notice of motion for rule sanctions with its january,letter,even though it did not serve at that time supporting affidavits or a memorandum of law.
first,koon chun complied literally with the requirements of the rule,as it served its notice of motion more than days before it filed the motion with the district cou
