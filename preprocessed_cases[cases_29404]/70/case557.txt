we consider these three cases together because they are all based on similar facts,they all name substantially the same defendants,and the same attorney represents all plaintiffs.in each case,the respective plaintiffs claims were dismissed by the district court and all plaintiffs appeal.our jurisdiction arises from and we affirm the judgments entered in all three cases

lafleur teen help,
plaintiff debbie lafleur,acting for herself and on behalf of her daughter sara gann,appeals the district court order dismissing her case on the ground that she failed to engage local utah counsel or to have her california attorney admitted pro hac vice in the utah federal court.lafleur also complains that the district court erred in dismissing her original complaint,but because we affirm the district court decision to dismiss the case for her failure to obey the order to hire local counsel,we do not address her claim of error in the decision to dismiss her original complaint.we conclude that even if dismissing the original complaint was improper,the case properly was dismissed for an independent reason.
sanction of dismissal 
the utah federal district court rules govern attorneys admission to practice in that court.it is incumbent upon an attorney to obtain admittance to practice.ducivr a.a nonresident attorney may be admitted pro hac vice,but must associate local counsel.ducivr d e.the court,on its own initiative,may impose sanctions for violation of the civil rules,including dismissal where extraordinary circumstances are present.ducivr.moreover,federal district courts have the inherent power to manage their business so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.chambers nasco,d quotation omitted.among these inherent powers is the ability to select an appropriate sanction.id.at.we review a court imposition of sanctions under its inherent power for abuse of discretion.martinez roscoe,cir quoting chambers,at.we review the district court underlying findings of fact for clear error.see dahl united states,cir reviewing for clear error underlying facts of dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the district court found that lafleur attorney,thomas burton,was a resident of california.at a hearing on defendants motion to dismiss,the district court asked burton if he was a resident of utah or california,to which burton responded,that a difficult question.i spend most of my time in california.my residence is here.lafleur app.at.when asked again,burton said,we rent here in utah,but i spend most of my time in california.that my main office.id.the district court tried one more time burton,i asked you a question.i want to know are you a resident of california for purposes of this court or utah id.burton answer was,i just tried to explain.i filed tax returns in both states.id.whereupon,the district court made the findings that burton was a resident of california and lafleur had not obtained local utah counsel,in violation of the local rule and an earlier court order.id.at.in addition to his statements at the hearing,burton stated in a proof of service appended to his motion for reconsideration that he reside d and was employed in pleasanton,california.id.at.based on this evidence,we conclude that the district court finding that burton was a resident of california was not clearly erroneous.
lafleur was on notice as of may,that defendants challenged burton authority to practice in utah.lafleur app.at defendants motion to strike first amended complaint and for sanctions.on december,the district court directed lafleur and burton to obtain local counsel within twenty days,or risk dismissal of the case.id.at.yet on july,they had not done so and,as a result,the case was dismissed.id.at.in sum,burton was found to be a resident of california,the district court directive to obtain local counsel was quite clear,and burton and his client had ample time to comply with the court order.under these circumstances,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court choice of sanction.
lafleur argues that other judges or magistrate judges in the utah federal district court permitted burton to represent plaintiffs in related cases against teen help.therefore,she maintains that the doctrine of issue preclusion prevented the district judge in this case from finding that burton was not authorized to practice in the utah federal court.we reject this argument for two reasons.first,lafleur general claims are not supported by references to the record as required by fed.and cir.we have reviewed the appendices filed in three of the cases on which lafleur relies,doubinin,dochterman and goold,but we decline to search the records for supporting references.see united states,cir.lafleur reference to an additional three unidentified companion cases is insufficient appellate argument.
second,the doctrine of issue preclusion does not apply.under utah law,four criteria must be met,one of which is that the issue in the prior case was competently,fully,and fairly litigated.atiya salt lake county,cir citing madsen borthick,utah.we are presented with no evidence that the issue was fully and fairly litigated in another case,so we decline to apply the doctrine.the district court judgment is affirmed.
goold teen help,
plaintiffs stanley goold,and his son stanley goold,iii the goolds,appeal the dismissal of their case as a sanction for failing to provide discovery.the basis of their complaint was that the younger goold had suffered psychological injury due to his placement in defendants facility,and the elder goold had incurred substantial expenses in obtaining his son release from the facility,as well as psychological injuries of his own.defendants filed discovery requests for the son psychological and school records and for the father documentation of his expenses and injuries.in february,the goolds responded by saying the records were being compiled.goold app.at.the magistrate judge held a hearing on november,on defendants motion to exclude expert witnesses because the goolds had not produced the necessary reports of their proposed experts or the documentation on which the reports were to be based,which was the same documentation defendants had requested.the magistrate judge extended the deadline for filing expert witness reports and imposed a sanction of on the goolds for requiring defendants to bring the motion.thereafter,defendants filed a motion to compel production of the psychological,financial,and school records.the magistrate judge held another hearing on february,and ordered the documents to be produced by february.goold app.at.the magistrate judge also imposed another monetary sanction against the goolds and their attorney for failure to cooperate with discovery,this time for.id.at.the discovery was not produced by the deadline,or ever.on june,the magistrate judge recommended that the action be dismissed due to the goolds willful failure to comply with the discovery order.id.at.the district court adopted the recommendation and dismissed the case with prejudice.id.at.
