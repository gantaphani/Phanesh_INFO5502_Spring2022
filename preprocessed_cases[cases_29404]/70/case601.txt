these are consolidated appeals from orders of the federal communications commission sanctioning james kay,and marc sobel for intentionally trying to mislead the commission,and for engaging in an unauthorized transfer of control of sobel land mobile service facilities.kay and sobel argue that the administrative record does not contain substantial evidence to support the orders.
since the early kay has provided radio mobile service in the los angeles area through a sole radio.he held many land mobile licenses pursuant to part of the commission rules,et,including licenses in the mhz band.sobel also was involved in the land mobile business in and around los angeles.he too held licenses for commercial land mobile radio stations,including licenses on the mhz band.
in the early the commission received information that kay might have been evading certain regulatory restrictions by conducting business under other names.one of the names was marc sobel dba airwave communications.other information suggested additional violations.the commission may require licensees to submit written statements of fact bearing on the question whether their licenses should be revoked.b.to that end,the commission wireless telecommunications bureau sent kay a letter in january requesting several categories of information,including the identity of the stations for which kay held licenses and the stations kay managed.kay lawyer responded with a series of demands and complaints,but supplied none of the information the bureau sought.
in december the commission issued an order designating issues for a hearing,including whether kay had violated b by failing to provide the information requested whether he had willfully violated commission rules governing station construction and operation whether he had abused the commission processes by filing applications in multiple names to avoid complying with the channel sharing and recovery rules and whether,in view of the evidence adduced on those issues,kay was fit to be a licensee.the order identified call signs subject to the hearing,eleven of which were held in sobel name.
about one month later,in january,kay filed a motion with the administrative law judge assigned to the case.among other things,the motion requested deletion of sobel call signs from the hearing designation order.kay motion stated 
james kay,is an individual.marc sobel is a different individual.kay does not do business in the name of marc sobel or use sobel name in any way.as shown by the affidavit of marc sobel attached as exhibit ii hereto,kay has no interest in any of the licenses or stations held by marc sobel.marc sobel has no interest in any of the licenses or stations authorized to kay or any business entity in which kay holds an interest.because kay has no interest in any license or station in common with marc sobel and because sobel was not named as a party to the instant proceeding,the presiding officer should either change the order to delete the reference to the stations identified as stations through or should dismiss the order with respect to those stations.
in a signed affidavit accompanying his motion,kay declared under penalty of perjury that the statements in the motion were true and correct.
sobel affidavit,attached to the motion,stated 
i,marc sobel,am an individual,entirely separate and apart in existence and identity from james kay.kay does not do business in my name and i do not do business in his name.kay has no interest in any radio station or license of which i am the licensee.i have no interest in any radio station or license of which kay is the licensee.i am not an employer or employee of kay,am not a partner with kay in any enterprise,and am not a shareholder in any corporation in which kay also holds an interest.i am not related to kay in any way by birth or marriage.
the alj certified the matter to the commission and the commission deleted sobel licenses from the kay proceeding.kay modified hdo,wl.thereafter,on june,the bureau sent a b letter of inquiry to sobel,asking him for information about his business relationship with kay.sobel order,wl.in his response,dated july,sobel attached a radio system management and marketing agreement.the management agreement,originally executed by sobel and kay in october and on december,set out the terms under which kay had been managing,during the previous three years,fifteen of sobel stations,licensed on the mhz band.kay had given the bureau a copy of the same agreement on march,in response to the bureau discovery request seeking all management agreements to which kay was a party.
by early,sobel had license applications pending with the commission.rather than grant any of them,the commission designated them,and the licenses sobel already held,for a hearing to determine whether sobel had transferred control of the stations named in the agreement to kay,in violation of d of the communications act,d.marc sobel,wl.section d provides that no station license,or any rights thereunder,shall be transferred to any person except upon application to the commission and upon finding by the commission that the public interest,convenience and necessity will be served thereby.the commission later added another issue whether sobel had misrepresented facts or lacked candor in the affidavit he submitted in support of kay january motion to remove sobel licenses from the kay hearing.marc sobel,fcc released may.
sobel hearing,in which kay intervened,was the first to be completed.see marc sobel,wl alj.alj frysiak determined that sobel had illegally transferred control of the stations identified in the management agreement.the evidence showed that kay was managing the stations that kay had prepared sobel license applications that kay provided all the money and equipment to build the stations that kay employees were involved in nearly all aspects of the operation of the stations that kay paid all the expenses of the stations that the revenues from operations went into kay bank accounts that sobel received none of the operating revenues and that kay had an option to purchase each of the stations at any time for each.at.alj frysiak also found that,in light of this evidence,sobel statement in his affidavit that kay had no interest in any of his radio stations or licenses was intended to mislead and deceive the commission with respect to kay actual role in the affairs of sobel mhz stations.the evidence also showed that sobel,in response to problems identified in his applications,provided the commission with customer invoices for the stations listed in the agreement.on the invoices,kay had masked out the name and address of lucky two way radio a name under which kay conducts business.alj frysiak found that both sobel and kay thought it crucial to withhold this information,which would have revealed to the commission that kay and sobel were not as independent of one another as sobel has claimed.id.at.the alj concluded that all of sobel licenses designated for the hearing should be revoked and that his applications should be denied.
nearly two years after the alj decision in sobel case,alj chachkin issued his decision in kay case.james kay,fcc,wl,alj,released.alj chachkin accepted the ruling in the sobel case that kay had participated in an unauthorized transfer of control of sobel stations.but he found entirely credible kay and sobel testimony that they had not intended to deceive the commission about their business arrangement.alj chachkin also accepted as entirely reasonable and credible kay testimony that when his motion stated he had no interest in sobel licenses or stations,he meant that he had no ownership interest in any station license held by sobel.he discounted the findings in the sobel hearing,believing them tainted because the bureau had deliberately concealed from alj frysiak the fact that kay had produced the agreement in march,in response to a discovery request.id.at.
the commission considered the sobel and kay cases concurrently and issued decisions in both cases on the same day.for reasons we will discuss in a moment,the commission found that sobel had engaged in an unauthorized transfer of control of the station
