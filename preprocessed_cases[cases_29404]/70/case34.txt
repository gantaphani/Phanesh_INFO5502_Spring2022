on the scheduled trial date,which had been set only six days earlier,the district court,acting sua sponte,dismissed this case with prejudice for lack of prosecution based on the plaintiffs with discovery deadlines,particularly their failure to produce a medical expert report.without condoning the plaintiffs lengthy and unjustified delay in producing their expert report,we reluctantly vacate the dismissal because,in short,the absence of a clearly communicated deadline for providing expert reports or notice that failing to do so more promptly could result in dismissal rendered that drastic sanction an abuse of discretion.we explain.
we review dismissals under rule b for abuse of discretion.malot dorado beach cottage,cir.although c laims that a court has abused its discretion in dismissing a case for failure to adhere to discovery orders or for failure to prosecute have not received a sympathetic ear,id.quoting damiani,cir,we must fairly balance the court venerable authority over case management with the larger concerns of justice,including the strong presumption in favor of deciding cases on the merits,and procedural aspects such as notice,cir.this is the rare case where the latter concerns outweigh the former.
the plaintiffs delay in producing their expert report was sufficiently extreme to warrant the harsh sanction of dismissal see malot,at describing this court tendency to reserve dismissal with prejudice for delays measured in years and they offered no legitimate excuse for that lengthy delay see,at.nevertheless,other relevant factors weigh heavily against imposing that drastic sanction here.
first of all,without condoning the lethargic pace that this litigation took,the responsibility for that pace was shared,in large part,by the district court which failed to exercise its abiding responsibility under federal and local rules to take an active role in case management,tower ventures,city of westfield,cir,by issu ing orders as soon as practicable fixing deadlines for the completion of discovery and other pretrial events.torres puerto rico,cir quoting.b see also,at vacating a dismissal with prejudice where the district court failed to impose deadlines through a scheduling order.contrary to federal rule b,the district court never issued an initial scheduling order and,contrary to the corresponding local rule,it never scheduled or held a pretrial conference and did not set a trial date until six days before trial.although the court did set a deadline for the plaintiffs production of their expert report,once that deadline expired without compliance,the court never set a new one even after the defendants eventually asked the court to do so.
the court further contributed to delay by taking months to rule on the parties motions,which,if promptly decided,would have moved the case along more expeditiously.for example,the court never ruled on the plaintiffs april request for more time to finalize their expert report took six months to rule on the defendants motion for a more definite statement took seven months to rule on the defendants motion to dismiss and never ruled on the defendants november motion to set a deadline for the plaintiffs to produce their expert report.
the court failure to set deadlines not only contributed to the case slow pace but also rendered its ultimate dismissal order unfair in two respects.first,there was no clearly communicated deadline for producing the plaintiffs expert report.see velázquez linares united states,cir acknowledging litigants unflagging duty to comply with clearly communicated orders quoting gonzalez,cir but vacating dismissal order based on uncertainty of the missed deadline.once the original deadline passed and the court failed to set a new deadline at both sides requests,the only operative deadline was the default deadline contained in rule a c i,under which the plaintiffs expert report was due at least days before the date set for trial or for the case to be ready for trial.but since no trial date was set until six days before trial,it was impossible for the plaintiffs to comply with that deadline.nor did the plaintiffs have any other way of knowing that trial was imminent.despite the relatively long time that had passed since the filing of the original complaint,the principal defendant had not yet answered the second amended complaint.nor had pretrial memoranda been filed or a pretrial conference scheduled or held.
second,the plaintiffs were given no express notice of the consequences of failure to produce their expert report more promptly.although the court included boilerplate language in two orders stating that f ailure to comply will result in the imposition of severe sanctions dismissal of the complaint with prejudice for lack of prosecution pursuant to.b,neither of those orders set a deadline for the production of the plaintiffs expert report therefore,those warnings did not give the plaintiffs realistic notice that they faced the harsh sanction of dismissal with prejudice for failure to produce their expert report before february,the date when the dismissal order issued.malot,at so concluding in similar circumstances.although prior notice of the consequences is not always required,pomales celulares telefónica,cir,in the absence of such a warning,the propriety of dismissal turns to a considerable extent,on the knowledge which the circumstances show such party may be taken to have of the consequences of his own conduct.id.quoting link wabash,d.as discussed above,given the lack of notice of the imminence of trial,the plaintiffs can not reasonably be deemed to have had notice that their delay in producing their expert report would lead to dismissal.
a further consideration weighing against the propriety of dismissal with prejudice is the absence of even any the defendants were prejudiced by the delay,at.given that the principal defendant had not yet answered the second amended complaint and that no pretrial memoranda had been filed or pretrial conference conducted,it is doubtful that the defendants or the court were any more ready for trial than the plaintiffs or that,even if the plaintiffs had produced their expert report more promptly,the trial would have gone forward on the precipitously announced date.
a final relevant factor is the absence of evidence that the district court considered the adequacy of lesser sanctions,id.at,such as continuing the trial to a date certain and imposing monetary sanctions to compensate the defendants for any harm caused by the continuance,esposito home depot,cir,and then setting short deadlines for production of the expert report and any other remaining pretrial events and strictly enforcing them,velázquez linares,at.
in sum,although the district court was justifiably unhappy with the plaintiffs lengthy and unjustified delay in producing their expert report,the court failure to set a clear deadline for doing so,to warn the plaintiffs of the consequences of noncompliance with that deadline,to make findings concerning the nature of the plaintiffs conduct and the prejudice to the defendants,and to consider the adequacy of lesser sanctions renders the sanction of dismissal with prejudice an abuse of its broad discretion to manage its caseload.accordingly,we vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.each party shall bear its own costs.
although the district court also premised its dismissal order,more generally,on the plaintiffs with discovery orders,it identified no such orders and none are pointed out by the appellees or apparent in the record.sociedad espanola de auxilio mutuo y beneficiencia,cir affirming dismissal with prejudice where district court made explicit and lengthy findings of egregious discovery abuses.the plaintiffs did delay in filing their second amended complaint,but their failure to do so more promptly was related to their delay in obtaining expert advice,not to any other discovery violations.
other than the absence of a deadline,the plaintiffs only excuse was that their original expert took longer than expected to produce his report and they were therefore forced to retain a new one.but the plaintiffs apparently gave their ori
