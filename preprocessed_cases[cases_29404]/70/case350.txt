the equitable life assurance society of the united states invoked the privilege to protect a large number of documents during discovery and used a privilege log to inform its opponent,emerald investments lp,of the documents being withheld.on emerald motion,however,a magistrate judge struck equitable entire privilege log as a discovery sanction because equitable left five documents on its log,which included more than documents.the sanction forced equitable to disclose all the log documents irrespective of whether the privilege actually applied.equitable filed objections,but the district court overruled them.after the action was dismissed,equitable appealed the sanction.because the imposition of the sanction constitutes an abuse of discretion,we reverse the sanction and remand the matter with instructions for emerald to return the pertinent documents to equitable.we affirm,on the other hand,the district court denial of emerald separate motion for additional discovery sanctions,in the form of attorneys fees and costs,against equitable.
background 
relying on diversity jurisdiction,emerald sued equitable in the northern district of illinois,alleging a number of state contract and tort claims.there are additional parties on both sides,but there is no need in this appeal to discuss them.equitable and emerald entered into a contract under which equitable sold annuities to emerald.emerald then traded these annuities with third parties.displeased,equitable then took steps to restrict emerald.the core dispute was whether the contract gave emerald the unlimited right to engage in such.this appeal,however,only concerns a discovery sanction and not the underlying claims.
privilege log proceedings 
the district court referred all discovery matters to a magistrate judge under federal rule of civil procedure a.the discovery proceedings that form the basis of this appeal are cumbersome,but the detailed discussion of those proceedings that follows is a prerequisite to explaining why and how the magistrate judge and thereby the district court abused his discretion in sanctioning equitable.
during discovery,equitable produced more than documents but initially withheld approximately documents,asserting the privilege.equitable submitted a privilege log listing the withheld documents.based on equitable descriptions of the withheld documents,emerald challenged the privilege log,suspecting that some documents were not privileged.specifically,on december,emerald moved to strike the log and requested that all documents on the log be disclosed.at a hearing on december,the magistrate judge expressed concern about having to review a large number of documents in camera and equitable conceded the need to improve its document descriptions and revise the log.
equitable submitted an amended privilege log on december.unsatisfied,emerald moved,on january,to strike the amended log and to compel production of all documents on the log.shortly before the january,hearing on the motion,equitable volunteered a privilege log to address emerald concerns.in these logs,equitable was tackling privilege issues involving counsels,their notes,their,and fine line distinctions between legal and nonlegal,business advice.at the hearing,emerald balked at the log,and the magistrate judge required equitable to produce a privilege log.
five days later,equitable submitted the log.at a status hearing on january,emerald informed the magistrate judge that it had some qualms about the log but reported that it was pleased with equitable willingness to work with emerald to resolve its remaining concerns.the magistrate judge therefore instructed the parties to continue to meet and confer on the matter.by this juncture,equitable had reduced the log to some entries,about a half box of documents.
the spirit of cooperation was.at a hearing on february,equitable sought the return of certain documents that it had inadvertently produced,privileged documents mistakenly released to emerald.that narrow issue spilled over into a larger debate about equitable log and about when to an counsel are protected by the privilege.one document sparked the debate and is illustrative of the privilege issues that led to this appeal.the document was an to an counsel recounting a meeting between equitable and emerald.equitable viewed the as a confidential communication seeking legal advice.the magistrate judge disagreed,ruling that the document was not privileged,and,as a result,denied the request for the document to be returned.emerald seized this opportunity to raise concerns about equitable ability to evaluate the other documents still listed on the log.emerald expressed a lack of confidence in equitable and its log as a whole.however,at the previous hearing,the magistrate judge had again expressed reluctance at a full,document,in camera review.emerald thus asked the magistrate judge to review,not the half box of documents that remained,but rather a sample of the documents in camera to check and see if all documents had been purged.under the proposal,the magistrate judge would review every fifteenth document on the log until he reached a total of ten documents.the magistrate judge adopted the proposal.
the magistrate judge announced his results on march,in a written opinion.equitable properly claimed the privilege in six of the ten documents and in portions of two others.however,the magistrate judge also found that two full documents were not privileged.the sample was composed of,handwritten notes,and the like,involving counsels.the magistrate judge closely parsed these documents.for example,he found that one by an counsel and sent to several equitable employees,including two other privileged but that nine handwritten words by an counsel on a copy of the were not privileged because it appeared that the handwritten words were not shared with anyone and did not concern legal advice.the magistrate judge then ordered equitable to disclose the material.
at another status hearing on march,emerald made an oral motion to strike the log and to order equitable to disclose each as well as the log.emerald argued for this global disclosure by again claiming that the log as a whole was unacceptably tainted by erroneous assertions of privilege,citing the february and march rulings for support.to further bolster its proposal,emerald allied itself with the magistrate judge previously expressed reluctance for full in camera review,claiming that inspecting all the documents would be an outrageous task.at.the magistrate judge declined global disclosure but required equitable to produce a privilege log,encouraging equitable to reduce the number of log entries.however,with an eye on the future,the magistrate judge agreed with emerald comments about in camera review and stated i do think i going to be prepared to go through documents.id.at.
equitable submitted the log on april,and disclosed a number of additional documents,thereby reducing the number of log entries to.unappeased,emerald immediately began insisting on a global disclosure of each document on the log at the next status hearing on april.emerald again claimed a lack of confidence in the log and orally moved to strike it based upon equitable past performance.emerald counsel requested additional sampling,telling the magistrate judge o bviously,i do think you need or should sit down and go through documents.at.to which the magistrate judge responded well,i not going to.id.equitable countered emerald position by arguing that it should not be forced to disclose indisputably privileged material such as the documents from the march opinion that the magistrate judge found to be completely privileged simply because the magistrate judge disagreed with equitable assertions of the privilege for another document.the magistrate judge,wanting to see if emerald had concrete problems with the new log as opposed to problems with equitable past performance,declined to sample or strike the log at that juncture and instead required both sides to confer with each other on any specific problems identified in the new log and report back.
at yet another status hearing on may,emerald reported concerns over a number of entries on the log.realizing that,in light of his prior comments,the magistrate judge was inclined against full in camera review,the parties proposed the following procedure to resolve emerald concerns emerald would move to compel the production of ten or fifteen documents and then the magistrate judge would review that limited number in camera.on may,emerald filed its motion to compel,requesting sixteen documents.after emerald filed the motion,equitable released two of the sixteen,believing that the two were privileged but deciding to waive the privilege as a effort to help bring an end to the matter.on june,the magistrate judge ruled from the bench on the remaining fourteen documents and found eight to be privileged,two to be partially privileged,and four to be.he then ordered the production of the material.the matter appeared to be at an end.
however,still dissatisfied with these partial disclosures,emerald resurrected its complaints about the entire log weeks after the june ruling and again pressed for global disclosure.it did so on july,by filing a motion for discovery sanctions under federal rules of civil procedure and.emerald reasoned that disclosure of every document without further review was an appropriate sanction in part because,with more than documents at issue,any plenary in camera inspection by the magistrate judge would be completely unmanageable.at.nevertheless,in addition to the sanction,emerald alternatively asked that the magistrate judge appoint a special master to review the remaining documents at equitable expense.
the magistrate judge did not pursue the special master alternative.rather,at the august,hearing on the motion,the magistrate judge sua sponte formulated his own procedure to determine if he would impose the sanction emerald would select twenty of the remaining documents on the log and then equitable would submit those twenty for in camera review.this was not a random sample every document that had not already been reviewed in camera was fair game.then,if the magistrate judge found four or more of the twenty to contain material,he would sanction equitable by ordering a disclosure of every document remaining on the log.on the other hand,if he found three or fewer to contain material,he would deny emerald motion.
two days later,equitable moved to amend the magistrate judge procedure,arguing in part for the special master alternative.further,since much had happened since the log was submitted on april,equitable requested an opportunity to evaluate the log in light of all the developments so as to prevent emerald from unfairly taking advantage of the magistrate judge sanction procedure and gaining a windfall of privileged material.on august,the magistrate judge rejected equitable requests from the bench,refusing all alternatives and marching forward with his sanction procedure from the august hearing.
after some more wrangling and two additional hearings,the magistrate judge announced his decision on the record on september.he first ruled that four documents were not protected by the privilege but that the other sixteen were.curiously,he then denied emerald motion,stating that he would not sanction equitable because he believed that his august ruling was that four and no more equaled no sanction.at.emerald challenged the magistrate judge recollection,accurately stating that the rule was,if there were four or more documents,we get everything.id.after a recess,the magistrate judge corrected his error and included a fifth document on the list of the.the magistrate judge thus reversed his earlier ruling and granted the motion,ruling that he could not rely on the integrity of the log.id.at.to support his sanction,the magistrate judge only offered the following 
the court is very well aware of the fact that,generally speaking,a finding of bad faith is required to strike an entire privilege log.the court has no direct information that equitable is dealing in bad faith,but the court draws the inference from a total of five privilege logs on which a sampling showed at least percent of the privilege log being the court infers bad faith from that statistic,especially in view of the known professional competence of the attorneys for equitable.they know what they doing t herefore,the entire privilege log is stricken and the order is that all the documents listed on the privilege log shall be disclosed.
id.at.this disclosure was to include documents that the magistrate judge himself found to contain privileged material eight from his march ruling,ten from his june ruling,and fifteen from his september ruling.
equitable protested the inference of bad faith,the privilege rulings on the individual documents,and,as it had done before,the sanction procedure,contending that it was being unjustly penalized for differences of opinion on the applicability of the privilege in the difficult area of material involving counsels.equitable raised these arguments at the september hearing,in its motion for reconsideration,at the september,hearing on the motion for reconsideration,in its objections to the district judge,and at the october,hearing on the objections,all to no avail.ultimately,after exhausting all avenues by the end of october,including an unsuccessful mandamus petition to this court,equitable released the documents to emerald.
log proceedings and dismissal 
long after the privilege log saga had closed,emerald discovered that complete diversity of citizenship was lacking for its action brought under.emerald,a limited partnership,realized in that,at the time it filed the suit in,one of its limited partners was a trust that had one trustee who was a citizen of new york.emerald was thus a citizen of new york.equitable also happened to be a citizen of new york,and,therefore,there was no subject matter jurisdiction.
by the time emerald discovered its error,the one individual no longer served as a trustee for the partner at issue and was replaced by a diverse individual.accordingly,at that point,emerald was no longer a citizen of new york.emerald decided to address its jurisdictional dilemma by filing a new civil action that was substantively similar to the original action but which accurately invoked diversity jurisdiction.emerald new action is currently pending before the same district court and the same magistrate judge.
additionally,there is another related case pending before the same district court and magistrate judge.early in the original action,equitable attempted to file a counterclaim against emerald however,the filing was untimely,and the district court denied equitable leave to file an untimely counterclaim.equitable then filed a separate civil action against emerald,alleging that emerald fraudulently induced equitable to enter into the contract in question.we will refer to equitable action as the counter action.
turning back to the original action which is the only action on appeal,the district court dismissed it,without prejudice,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction two weeks after emerald instituted the new action.the district court order of dismissal and accompanying judgment explicitly stated that the complaint and suit are dismissed,without prejudice.
at the time of dismissal,the district court also terminated all pending motions in the original action,including one that will be of import below emerald motion for reasonable expenses regarding the privilege log motions and related events.that motion sought an additional discovery sanction against equitable and claimed more than in attorneys fees and costs incurred during the privilege log proceedings.emerald filed the motion nearly seventeen months after the magistrate judge had struck equitable privilege log,which is why the motion was still pending in when the action was dismissed.
viewing the dismissal as a final decision from which it could appeal the magistrate judge sanction and the corresponding denial of its objections to the sanction under,equitable filed this appeal.in response,emerald,in addition to defending the sanction,argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear the appeal.in the event we reject its jurisdictional attack,emerald has the denial of its motion for reasonable expenses.we will first address jurisdiction and then turn to the substance of the appeal and.
ii.jurisdiction 
before turning to emerald specific challenges,we initially note that,although subject matter jurisdiction turned out to be lacking for this particular action,we still have the authority to adjudicate matters regarding sanctions.see willy coastal,d matos richard nellis,cir.
emerald advances three jurisdictional arguments.it contends that the dismissal was not a final decision for purposes because,first,the district court dismissed the original action without prejudice and,second,the new and counter actions remain pending before the district court.third,emerald raises a broader concern,arguing that the dismissal did not aggrieve equitable.we will address each issue in turn.
first,emerald focus on the without prejudice language in the district court order of dismissal and judgment is misplaced.the inquiry is not,as emerald suggests,whether a dismissal is with prejudice or not.trippe am.power conservation,cir.rather,t he jurisdictional question in this case turns on whether the district court dismissed emerald action as opposed to just its complaint.benjamin united states,cir.because,unlike the dismissal of a complaint,which can ordinarily be amended,the dismissal of the entire action ends the litigation and,therefore,permits an appeal under paganis blonstein,cir see also hoskins poelstra,cir.the test for finality is not whether the suit is dismissed with prejudice or without prejudice,on the merits or on a jurisdictional ground or on a procedural ground the test is whether the district court has finished with the case.hill potter,cir.
here,the district court has unquestionably finished with the original action.the order of dismissal and the judgment dismissed the complaint and the suit.by contrasting the word suit against the word complaint in this context,the district court unequivocally indicated that this civil action was terminated in toto.this conclusion is bolstered by a passage in the order of dismissal stating that this case must be dismissed in its entirety.at emphasis added.see willhelm airlines,cir we have jurisdiction over this appeal only if the district court has terminated the litigation in its entirety.emphasis added.
furthermore,it was necessary for the district court to dismiss the original action in its entirety as it was infected with an incurable jurisdictional the complaint would not have overcome the want of complete diversity at the commencement of the original action.see grupo dataflux atlas global group,d johnson wattenbarger,cir.as a result,the original action was dead,hoskins,at nothing more was ever going to happen on the merits of emerald underlying claims within confines of the original action,tdk elecs.draiman,cir.the district court did not employ the words without prejudice to enable a continuation of the original suit at some future date rather,the district court used those words so as not to impede emerald ability to present its underlying claims in a new and independent action of which the privilege log sanction would not be a constituent part.see farrand lutheran,cir.contrary to emerald contention,moreover,the fact t hat the dismissal was without prejudice to filing another suit does not make the cause unappealable,for denial of relief and dismissal of the case ended this suit as far as the district court was concerned.united states wallace tiernan.see also hill,at.in short,the district court made it clear that he has washed his hands of the case,and the resolution is as final as it can be for purposes of.tdk,at see also hill,at banks sec y of.family soc.servs,cir.
second,the fact that new and counter actions remain pending before the district court does not alter the finality of the judgment in the original action.relying exclusively on sandwiches,wendy international,cir,emerald contends that,since there are similar legal and factual issues in each of the three actions,the original,new,and counter actions,equitable must wait to appeal the privilege log sanction until the new and counter actions are fully adjudicated by the district court.emerald,however,completely misreads sandwiches.
sandwiches stands for the principle that when a district court ambiguously consolidates two civil actions by failing to specify whether they are fully consolidated,consolidated for every purpose or partially consolidated,consolidated only for a limited purpose,such as discovery,then this court will treat the two actions as fully consolidated so long as the two are sufficiently closely related.id.at.the consequence of full consolidation is that the two become a single judicial unit for purposes of federal rule of civil procedure b,and accordingly a judgment that does not dispose of all claims of all parties is not appealable unless the district court makes the findings required by rule b.brown united states,cir.
here,however,there was no ambiguous consolidation as there was in sandwiches.rather,there was no even for a limited purpose.although there are overlapping factual and legal issues among the three actions and while there has been some informal merger of proceedings,joint hearings held,there has been no formal consolidation.in fact,the district court,in the order dismissing the original action,explicitly rejected the possibility of consolidation absent any consolidation,the original action is thus a wholly independent,civil action.sandwiches expressly addressed the distinction between the situation in that case from the situation here the court explained that when two related cases have not been consolidated for any purpose,a party could appeal the judgment in one of the cases notwithstanding the link between the two related cases and the fact that the other related case remains pending before the district court.at.consequently,the rule from sandwiches for handling ambiguous consolidations is thoroughly inapplicable here.equitable does not have to wait to appeal the privilege log sanction until the district court is finished with the new and counter actions.since the sanction is a component of no other action but the original action,the time to appeal the sanction was when the original action became final.
third,emerald argument about equitable not being aggrieved is also meritless.assuredly,a defendant,such as equitable,is not aggrieved by the dismissal of a suit against it.the dismissal,however,is not the subject of this appeal.rather,the dismissal is the vehicle that enables equitable to appeal the sanction,which certainly did aggrieve equitable and continues to do so.an appeal of a final decision brings up for review all interlocutory decisions of the district court that were adverse to the appellant and that have not become moot.chicago bd.of educ.substance,cir alejo heller,cir cleveland hair clinic,puig,cir sanction at issue.otherwise there would be no way to obtain appellate review of those rulings,save for the exceptional few that were appealable regardless of finality.bastian petren res,cir.
moreover,appellate review of a sanction does not depend on which party ultimately prevailed in the final decision of the lawsuit.one could win a huge triumph on the merits and still appeal an adverse sanction suffered along the way.that is because when one is sanctioned in the course of litigation,immediate satisfaction of the sanction is the cost one must bear for the privilege of continuing to litigate.the propriety of the sanction may then be challenged on appeal once there is a final decision in the case,even if that is long after the sanction was satisfied.corley rosewood care,of peoria,cir.furthermore,satisfaction of the sanction does not moot the appeal because the appellate court can fashion effective relief to undo the sanction or at least mitigate the lasting adverse effects of the sanction for instance,in this case,we could order that the documents be returned.id.
here,the sanction was and is adverse to equitable the sanction forced equitable to turn over privileged information to its litigation adversary further,that decision is not moot as the result of the sanction,eq
