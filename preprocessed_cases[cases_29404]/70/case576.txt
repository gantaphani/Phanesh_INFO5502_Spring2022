if,as the bible says,a n honest answer is like a kiss on the lips,proverbs,a pleading founded on a lie is like a kick in the gut.the question this appeal presents is whether a district court can dismiss a case with prejudice because the plaintiff filed and litigated his complaint under a false name.
the plaintiff real name,we now know,is cesar vasquez.the first time he was arrested in florida was in for cocaine trafficking.on that occasion he gave the arresting officers the name yan michael zocaras,and he was booked into the department of corrections system under that name.the plaintiff has four florida felony convictions,and the arrests leading to some of them may have occurred between his arrest for cocaine trafficking in and his arrest for armed home invasion in,which gave rise to this case.regardless,when the plaintiff was arrested in he told the officers that his name was carlos vasquez.as a result,when he was booked into the department of corrections following that arrest his name was listed as yan zocaras,carlos vasquez.his guilty plea and the resulting incarceration from the arrest were both entered under that name.
with four prior felony convictions,the plaintiff is known to the florida department of corrections by several names luis garcia,carlos vasquez,michael vasquez,yan michael zocaras,and yan zocaras.in,he obtained a florida driver license in the name yan zocaras.
in july,the plaintiff filed this action against several police officers for injuries he alleged were sustained when he was arrested in on the home invasion charges.five months later he filed a second complaint based on the same facts.both complaints were filed using the name yan zocaras,carlos vasquez.neither mentioned the name cesar vasquez.the two cases were consolidated,and then in february counsel entered an appearance for the plaintiff,who had been proceeding pro se.
from the beginning of this case until the jury trial,which took place in september,the plaintiff filed more than thirty pleadings and motions under the false name yan zocaras carlos vasquez.at the trial the plaintiff was the first witness to testify.the initial testimony went like this 
please state your name for the record.
yan zocaras.
q.zocaras,are you known by any other names 
q.what names are those 
carlos vasquez.
are you known by any other names 
yes with my true name.
q.what is your true name 
cesar vasquez.
have you been known by any other names other than carlos vasquez and cesar vasquez 
began like this 
cesar vasquez is your true name 
yan zocaras is a false name 
you proceeding here in court under a false name 
puentes objection,your honor.argumentative.
the court sustained.rephrase your question.
q.so vasquez,is it true that you had a florida id under the name yan zocaras 
and when you were arrested by the police,you gave them the name carlos vasquez is that correct 
q.you lied about your name 
on the next day,the plaintiff gave this explanation to the jury about why he had used a false name in the case 
well,when i was sentenced,then i went to prison.i notified them that that was not my name and that i wanted to have to my name.i asked them to change it to my name.and they told me that i had to continue to use that name until my sentence was over.and that why i put the complaint under that name,because i could have it under my name,as this was the name that i had in prison.
after the plaintiff rested,the defendants called two witnesses before resting.
the defendants then moved to dismiss pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure and b because the plaintiff had proceeded under the false name yan zocaras.the district court conducted a hearing on the motion the following day and gave the plaintiff an opportunity to explain his actions.at one point,the district court stated for the record let me announce the case once more.yan zocaras,now known as cesar vasquez,versus emilio lopez and miguel rodriguez,case.
at the hearing on the motion to dismiss the court directed the attorneys for the plaintiff to discuss with him whether he would waive his fifth amendment rights which would permit further inquiry into his use of a false name during the litigation.they told the court that they were civil lawyers who did not feel qualified to advise the plaintiff on the slew of possible criminal issues here.the court then sent for an assistant federal public defender and recessed to provide an opportunity for her to advise the plaintiff on whether to waive the fifth amendment.after receiving further advice,the plaintiff asserted his fifth amendment rights as to any additional questioning about his use of false names.
counsel for the plaintiff made a number of arguments against dismissal.the primary one was an assertion that the plaintiff had not acted willfully or in bad faith but only negligently based on a misunderstanding of what he had been told by the department of corrections.after hearing all that the plaintiff counsel had to say,the district court entered detailed findings and conclusions,a copy of which we have attached to this opinion as appendix among other things,the court found that the plaintiff use of a false name throughout the two years leading up to the trial had not been negligent or the result of a misunderstanding but was deliberate and willful.the court followed up its findings and conclusions from the bench with a written order to the same effect,a copy of which is appendix b to this opinion.this appeal by the plaintiff followed.
we review the district court decision to dismiss a case for failure to comply with the rules of the court for an abuse of discretion.betty k agencies,monada,cir.discretion means the district court has a range of choice,and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.id.quoting guideone elite ins.old cutler presbyterian church,cir.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.united states martinelli,cir.we have articulated a analysis for determining when an action should be dismissed as a sanction.there must be both a clear record of willful conduct and a finding that lesser sanctions are inadequate.betty k agencies,at.
rule b makes clear that a trial court has discretion to impose sanctions on a party who fails to adhere to court rules.b.but that discretion is not unlimited,and the d ismissal of a case with prejudice is considered a sanction of last resort,applicable only in extreme circumstances.goforth owens,cir.dismissal with prejudice is not proper unless the district court finds a clear record of delay or willful conduct and that lesser sanctions are inadequate to correct such conduct.betty k agencies,at.mere negligence or confusion is not sufficient to justify a finding of delay or willful misconduct.mckelvey v.at t,cir.in addition to its power under rule b,a court also has the inherent ability to dismiss a claim in light of its authority to enforce its orders and provide for the efficient disposition of litigation.see link wabash,d.
the plaintiff contends that the record contains no evidence that his use of a false name was willful instead of merely negligent.we disagree for the reasons the district court set out in its detailed findings of fact.our review of that court findings is only for clear error,and here there clearly is none.the court convincingly rejected each of the arguments that the plaintiff counsel put forward against a finding of willfulness,and we adopt its reasoning.the plaintiff did not merely slip up.he followed a pattern of deception for a period of at least six years from the time he got the driver license in through multiple arrests,convictions,and incarcerations,and filed more than thirty pleadings and motions under a false name in this case.at least some of those pleadings and motions were filed under penalty of perjury.all of them hid his actual identity.not until the pretrial proceedings were completed and a jury was in the box did the plaintiff finally own up to who he really is.
a trial is not a masquerade party nor is it a game of judicial where the plaintiff may offer the defendant the added challenge of uncovering his real name.we sometimes speak of litigation as a search for the truth,but the parties ought not have to search for each other true identity.rule a requires that the name of the parties be disclosed in the complaint rule forbids lying in pleadings,motions,and other papers filed with the court and rule b provides for dismissal with prejudice as the ultimate sanction for violation of the rules.fed.civ.pro.a fed.civ.pro.fed.civ.pro.b.
that brings us to the second reason the plaintiff asserts against the district court order of dismissal.the plaintiff contends that the dismissal was improper because the district court did not explicitly consider lesser sanctions and reject them as inadequate.in addition to finding willful contempt,a district court must consider the possibility of alternative,lesser sanctions.betty k agencies,at.however,we have made clear that such consideration need not be explicit.gratton great am.commc ns,cir dismissal under rule b is appropriate where there is an implicit or explicit finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice.goforth owens,cir the record also supports an implicit finding that any lesser sanction than dismissal would not have served the interests of justice.
it is true that the district court did not explicitly consider and reject lesser sanctions,but a determination that no other sanction would suffice radiates from its explanation for the dismissal.no point would be served by remanding for the court to make explicit that which is inescapably implicit.and the court implicit determination is correct.nothing short of putting the plaintiff out of court will properly punish his serious and protracted violation of the rules and adequately deter future violations by other parties.as the seventh circuit explained in a similar case,f iling a case under a false name deliberately,and without sufficient justification,certainly qualifies as flagrant contempt for the judicial process and amounts to behavior that transcends the interests of the parties in the underlying action.dotson bravo,cir.it is conduct that so violates the judicial process that imposition of a harsh penalty is appropriate not only to reprimand the offender,but also to deter future parties from trampling upon the integrity of the court.see also goforth,at w here any other sanction would fail to cure the harm dismissal can be appropriate.permitting the plaintiff to pursue his claim would take the punch out of the punishment for pummeling the probity of the judicial system.
the plaintiff contends that the district court erred by considering the prejudice his misconduct had caused the defendants when it determined the sanction to impose.the legal premise of that assertion has no basis in law,logic,or common sense.the misconduct harmed the judicial system and it also harmed the defendants.it resulted in them proceeding through the litigation for two years without knowing the true identity of the person who was demanding that the court declare they had violated his constitutional rights and force them to pay him damages.proper discovery and trial preparation are not possible in those circumstances,and jury voir dire is undermined.because the rules of court protect not just the court but also the parties,it is entirely fitting to consider harm to other parties interests in determining the sanction to be imposed for a violation of the rules.
in a spell of speciousness,the plaintiff argues that dismissal is too drastic a sanction because the defendants could have uncovered his falsehood earlier if they had diligently pursued their discovery rights.we are as unpersuaded by that argument as we would be by one from an embezzler who blamed his victim for not uncovering the misappropriation scheme earlier.
dismissal with prejudice is,as we have said,an extreme sanction,see goforth,at,but it is justified in extreme circumstances.this is another way of saying that the sanction imposed should fit the interests jeopardized and the harm caused by the violation.in this case it does.because courts must be able to preserve the integrity of the judicial process,we have no hesitation in concluding that a party who files suit under a false name and proceeds with that deception right up to trial loses the right to seek judicial relief for the claims he was advancing.
appendix a 
the court in this case,the plaintiff,whose true name is cesar vasquez,filed two separate complaints,both filed under penalty of perjury,under a false name,the false name being yan zocarras.
in this case,the plaintiff filed two separate affidavits of indigency.and in those affidavits of indigency the first portion of the affidavit says,i and then a blank for the name,in which he filled in the name yan zocarras.
both of those affidavits were filed under a false name.
for the two separate cases concerning five convictions in the state of florida,both of those convictions were under false names.the first conviction was under the name yan michael zocarras the second conviction was under the name carlos vasquez.
so as he stands today in the department of corrections for the state of there have been two department of corrections officers here every day,along with the united states marshals,to guard this state prisoner.he remains under a false name.
the plaintiff when he was arrested in the underlying facts of this civil rights action gave the false name carlos vasquez,which he testified in open court he knew was a lie.
he also testified that he knew that there was an open case against him at the time that he gave the false name of carlos vasquez,rather than giving his other false name,which was yan michael zocarras.
while the plaintiff on recall did testify that he was told he had to use the name under which he was sentenced,and it seems the inference is that since his first conviction was under the false name yan michael zocarras in the state of florida,he was eventually committed to the department of corrections under the false name yan michael zocarras with the alias of carlos vasquez and several other aliases.
at no time did the plaintiff reveal to either the state court system or the state department of corrections that his true name is cesar vasquez.as far as they concerned,he still yan michael zocarras,also known as carlos vasquez,also known as miguel vasquez,also known as luis garcia,yan zocarras,yan michael zocarras.
nowhere in the department of corrections information is the name cesar vasquez.and in fact,the first time it was revealed to at least the it may very well be plaintiff at the time on direct when his counsel asked him,are you known by any other names 
and he said,none,other than my true name.
and when asked the question,what is that true name he said,cesar vasquez.
on recall,vasquez indicated that he was told that he had to continue to use the name until my sentence was over.and that why i put the complaint under that name,because i could have it under my name,as this was the name that i had in prison.
except he filed the complaint in the case that was originally filed before me of yan zocarras,also known as carlos vasquez,the name that he was arrested under in the underlying facts.there was nothing that precluded him from putting a second also known as and including the name cesar vasquez or indicating to the court in his complaint,while i known as yan zocarras in prison,because that what i was convicted under and sentenced under,my true name is cesar vasquez.
he chose not to do that.
at this juncture,the defendant has indicated when they made their motion that they do know what additional information there is under the name cesar vasquez.certainly there a strong inference that the plaintiff was hiding that name.
he had obtained a driver license in under the name of yan zocarras,which raises an inference that he had to present some kind of identification that would enable him to obtain that driver license.the plaintiff here started the charade and he continued the charade.
rule requires the names of the parties and rule provides for sanctions concerning false representations made willfully to the court by presenting to the i quoting from rule b by presenting to the court whether by signing,filing,submitting or later advocating in a pleading,written motion or other paper,an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person knowledge,information and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,it is not being presented for any improper purpose.the claims,defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law.the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support.
and rule a requires a signature to every pleading,written motion or other paper either by the attorney or pro se party and any unsigned paper shall be stricken unless omission of a signature is corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or the party.
the circuit in dotson,versus bravo,at,a decision by the circuit,in a case that is incredibly similar in its factual basis to this case dismissed and approved the dismissal by the district court,approved the dismissal with prejudice of a action brought against police officers and the city for malicious prosecution because of the plaintiff failure to proceed under his true name,which violated the civil rule which mandated that every pleading include the names of all the parties.
and there was a discovery violation,and it was eventually revealed on discovery that the court also dismissed under the court inherent authority to address flagrant contempt.
in that case at page,the circuit teaches us misconduct may exhibit such flagrant contempt for the court and its processes that to allow the offending party to continue to invoke the judicial mechanism for its own benefit would raise concerns about the integrity and credibility of the civil justice system that transcends the interest of the parties immediately before the court.filing a case under a false name deliberately and without sufficient justification certainly qualifies as flagrant contempt for the judicial process and amounts to behavior that transcends the interests of the parties in the underlying action.
the court goes on to state,the instant case represents precisely the situation where one party conduct so violates the judicial process that imposition of a harsh penalty is appropriate,not only to reprimand the offender,but also to deter fewer parties from trampling upon the integrity of the court.
in that case,the plaintiff argued that it was wrong to file the case under the name he was convicted and sentenced under in the state criminal proceedings,because everything occurred under that name.the court stated the fact is that his fraudulent conduct produced such a result and does not justify continuance of the charade in federal court.
we can not allow a plaintiff this is at to so abuse the court system in order to avoid criminal justice yet obtain civil reward.there in the dotson case,it was revealed that he had outstanding warrants because there was no disclosure of his true name and there been such prejudice to the defendants.we do not know why this plaintiff did not disclose his true name.
if the plaintiff sought to expose the truth of what occurred on january,he should not have begun the lie that now leads to the dismissal of his case.the city and bravo were prejudiced in their defense of this case despite shepherd eventual.
there in the bravo case,it was disclosed in discovery.here,the disclosure was not until the plaintiff was on the stand two days ago and he revealed his true name for the first time.
sitting in this courtroom have been two florida department of corrections officers with the defendant who have transported him faithfully each and every day after i entered an order having him transported from his institution,his assigned institution,to an institution in miami so he could be transported every day.
his lawyers that were provided by the volunteer lawyers after a tremendous effort by the court to have the volunteer lawyers take this i commend them for their service in this case,for volunteering to represent a plaintiff in a civil rights action.
we have two city of miami police officers who are the defendants in this case,who i would venture to say have spent a considerable amount of time not only in court,but out of court in the defense of this case.and the united states marshals have been present as well as court security officers for the security of the court and the persons in the courtroom.
everything has been done so that a plaintiff could prosecute a civil rights claim under a false name.
and in addition,i have appointed a federal public defender to represent the defendant regarding the issues that have now arisen before the court.and a jury was impaneled,who have now been waiting for almost two hours,and have spent the last three days hearing this case.this was all done for someone who did not even represent themselves truthfully before the court.
vasquez has attempted to make a mockery of the justice system.i find that his misrepresentations were willful and deliberate,even in the light most favorable to him,that he was committed under the name yan zocarras and had to file his lawsuit.he knew enough to file carlos vasquez,his second false name.he easily could have said cesar vasquez and indicated that name to the court and to the defendants.
because his actions raise such concerns about the integrity and credibility of the civil justice system that transcends the interests of the parties that appear before this court and because i find his willful and deliberate behavior without justification is flagrant contempt for the judicial process,i find that i must impose a harsh penalty at this juncture,at this stage of the proceedings of dismissal not only to reprimand the offender,but to deter future parties from trampling upon the integrity of the court.
the integrity of this court and the judicial system in this country is much too important for it to bend and succumb and to allow someone to prosecute such an important claim under the pretenses of a false name.
i am going to grant the defendants motions under rule,rule and rule b for dismissal with prejudice,and i am going to inform the jury that i have dismissed this case because the plaintiff filed this action under a false name.
