james carroll,trustee of debtor jeffrey prosser bankruptcy estate,appeals the district court order vacating the bankruptcy court imposition of sanctions.the bankruptcy court imposed sanctions because of the numerous and inflammatory submissions prosser counsel filed in prosser bankruptcy and associated adversary proceeding.because these filings vexatiously and unnecessarily multiplied the bankruptcy proceedings and the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by imposing such sanctions,we will reverse the district court order vacating them.
prosser filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in.his petition was converted to a chapter petition and carroll was appointed as trustee of prosser estate.during the relevant portion of his bankruptcy proceedings,prosser was represented by attorneys norman abood,robert craig,and lawrence schoenbach collectively,the prosser counsel,and carroll was represented by fox rothschild,llp fox rothschild.
a trial took place in to adjudicate creditors objections to prosser claim that certain property was exempt from the bankruptcy proceedings the exemptions trial.arthur stelzer,prosser former valet and personal assistant,app,testified for the creditors.he testified that prosser asked him to destroy several of prosser computer hard drives after prosser filed for bankruptcy.based in part on stelzer testimony,the bankruptcy court denied the exemptions prosser claimed.thereafter,carroll and others initiated an adversary proceeding,seeking denial of prosser discharge under a,based on evidence that the debtor has concealed,destroyed,mutilated,falsified,or failed to keep or preserve any recorded information from which the debtor financial condition or business transactions might be ascertained.a.
in connection with this adversary proceeding,prosser deposed stelzer in an effort to undermine his testimony at the exemptions trial.during the january,deposition,at which the bankruptcy judge presided,the prosser counsel inquired into the payment of stelzer legal fees by third parties and contacts stelzer had with carroll and carroll counsel.with respect to his legal fees,stelzer explained that he had felt intimidated and frightened when first served with a subpoena in connection with the exemptions trial and that prompted him to seek legal representation.app.stelzer explained that these legal fees were paid either by the debtor companies or by the law firm representing the trustee in a separate but related chapter proceeding.when asked whether,as a result of this arrangement,stelzer had an understanding that he would do something in exchange for them paying for his fees,he replied,w ell,if i called for whatever,just to come tell the truth.app.
as to stelzer contact with carroll,dana katz,a fox rothschild attorney representing carroll,stated to the bankruptcy judge that carroll had never spoken to stelzer outside of trial testimony during the exemptions proceedings.app.stelzer,however,testified that he and carroll once had dinner together long before stelzer testified at the exemptions trial.app.according to stelzer,they discussed how stelzer life was just in general,general,light conversation,t he wine they had for dinner,and what it was like to work for prosser,prosser,and the children,general,really general chitchat.id.stelzer testified that he and carroll did not discuss prosser hard drives,prosser finances,or the possibility that stelzer might later be called to testify in a future proceeding such as the exemptions trial.
two weeks later,on january,the prosser counsel filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing into what they labeled an alleged bribery scheme,asserting that stelzer gave unfavorable testimony during the exemptions trial in exchange for payment of his attorney fees in multiple litigations,app,and that carroll counsel had misrepresented carroll contacts with stelzer the district court referred the motion to the bankruptcy judge on january.that same day,the parties coincidentally appeared before the bankruptcy court to address other matters.during the january,hearing,the bankruptcy court discussed the prosser counsel motion for an evidentiary hearing and suggested it be opened as a miscellaneous adversary proceeding 
during that hearing,william stassen,a fox rothschild attorney,addressed the contacts between carroll and stelzer.he informed the bankruptcy court that katz statement that carroll and stelzer had never met prior to the exemptions trial was inaccurate and that carroll had in fact met stelzer for dinner before fox rothschild became carroll counsel.stassen stated 
w e will submit to the court a corrected statement for the court record.quite frankly,your honor,katz is devastated.i mean,she really upset that she made the representation to the court.i can say emphatically that it was clearly not a knowing statement with regard to carroll not having contact with stelzer.
app.the bankruptcy court acknowledged stassen statement without comment,and the hearing moved on to other matters.
on january,apparently in response to the district court referral of their motion for an evidentiary hearing to the bankruptcy court,the prosser counsel issued a press release entitled hearing ordered on bribery scheme in which they stated that prosser was the target of an alleged bribery scheme through which stelzer was provided with free legal services in exchange for his testimony.app.the following day,the prosser counsel filed an adversary complaint the adversary complaint in bankruptcy court against carroll and fox rothschild,among others,on the basis of their apparent bribery of stelzer.app.the adversary complaint repeated the allegation from their press release that stelzer had been provided free legal services in exchange for his testimony.app.it also quoted stelzer deposition testimony about his dinner with carroll and asserted that carroll was attempt ing to distance himself from stelzer,as shown by his counsel statement that he and stelzer had never interacted.app.the adversary complaint contended that fox rothschild had violated their duty of candor to the court by failing to report the alleged bribery scheme.app.it further alleged that carroll had failed to report this possible bribery scheme to the united states attorney as required under the adversary complaint sought discovery and a hearing to determine whether sanctions,disqualification referral for further disciplinary proceedings should be imposed.app.
the same day the prosser counsel filed the adversary complaint,they also filed two objections to carroll and fox rothschild quarterly applications for compensation and reimbursement of expenses the fee objections,contending that serious questions ha d arisen with regard to the conduct of carroll his c ounsel as were more fully detailed in the adversary complaint.app.the following day,february,the prosser counsel filed a motion for a hearing regarding an alleged conflict of interest between carroll and his attorneys the conflicts motion arising from payment of stelzer legal fees from estate assets in exchange for stelzer testimony.the conflicts motion argued that stelzer and carroll attorneys may have engaged in criminal activity.app.
on march,the bankruptcy court dismissed the motion for an evidentiary hearing underlying the adversary complaint as against fox rothschild,holding that,b ased on the corrections made orally by fox rothschild during the omnibus motions hearing on january,and in writing thereafter,it is clear that there is no issue in dispute with regard to the veracity of the representation.app.footnote omitted.that same day,the bankruptcy court denied the conflicts motion,holding that carroll was not represented by conflicted counsel,that no specific conduct had been identified warranting an evidentiary hearing as to carroll,and that the conflicts motion was based on sixth amendment law generally applicable only in criminal proceedings.on march,the prosser counsel voluntarily dismissed the claims embodied in the motion for an evidentiary hearing as against carroll individually and withdrew the fee objections 
on april,carroll moved for legal fees and expenses against the prosser counsel pursuant
