we review de novo a district court invocation of its inherent power and the sanctions granted under its inherent power for an abuse of discretion fdic maxxam,cir citation omitted.we review the factual findings underlying those sanctions,however,only for clear error.see crowe smith,cir.
camiña claims that the district court lacked inherent authority to impose sanctions for her conduct during arbitration.in the alternative,she argues that the court employed the wrong standard of proof in finding that she acted in bad faith,and that the sanctions were not supported by the evidence.because the court lacked inherent authority to sanction camiña for her actions during arbitration,we need not address her alternative claims.
a district court has the inherent authority to impose sanctions in order to control the litigation before it.nasco,calcasieu television radio,cir,aff sub nom.chambers nasco,d.the court may also use that power to sanction conduct,see chambers,at,if it is in direct defiance of the sanctioning court,cjc holdings,wright lato,cir,or constitutes disobedience to the orders of the judiciary,chambers,d.inherent power,however,may be exercised only if essential to preserve the authority of the court natural gas pipeline of am.energy gathering,cir.
in maxxam,we confirmed the limited reach of the court inherent authority.there the fdic sued charles hurwitz,alleging that he was responsible for the failure of a savings and loan association.the fdic also encouraged the office of thrift supervision ots to pursue similar claims in an administrative proceeding.the fdic moved that the district court stay its case pending completion of the ots proceeding.when the district court denied that motion,the fdic continued to support the administrative action.invoking its inherent powers,the court sanctioned the fdic for hurwitz expenses in defending the ots action.we reversed part of those sanctions on the ground that the inherent power does not extend to collateral proceedings that do not threaten the court own judicial authority or proceedings.maxxam,at.inherent authority is not a broad reservoir of power,ready at an imperial hand,but a limited source an implied power squeezed from the need to make the court function.id.at citation omitted.
here the district court distinguished maxxam,positing that arbitration is not a collateral proceeding but instead an annex to litigation.it reasoned that because the court ordered the parties to arbitrate,it retained the authority to impose sanctions for conduct committed in arbitration.that approach is puzzling.to begin with,arbitration is not an annex to litigation,but an alternative method for dispute resolution treating arbitration as if it were an appendage to adjudication is a mistake that would undermine the very purpose of arbitration the provision of a relatively quick,efficient and informal means of private dispute settlement antwine prudential bache,cir emphasis added.parties agree to arbitration to avoid litigation they voluntarily surrender judicial remedies in favor of an extrajudicial process.
furthermore,the notion that the court inherent authority turns on whether the arbitration was is untenable.positive software claims that the district court retained significant supervisory authority by virtue of ordering the parties to arbitrate.when asked,in oral argument,whether the court would have had inherent authority to sanction camiña if the parties had chosen to enter arbitration at the outset,positive software counsel candidly stated,of course maxxam.positive software distinction,then,would allow trial courts to oversee arbitrations in which one party had to be compelled to arbitrate but not those in which both parties complied with their arbitration agreement.such a significant and perverse asymmetry can not be justified,and positive software efforts to distinguish this case from maxxam are unavailing.
in an attempt to rescue the sanctions order,positive software additionally claims that the sanctions are based on camiña direct defiance of the preliminary injunction and protective order.that assertion,however,is belied by the court own explicit explanation that the sanctioned conduct took place in connection with the arbitration,not in connection with discovery under the court supervision.in other words,the court imposed sanctions not on account of any direct violation of a court order,but only because it found that camiña had exhibited four particular instances of bad faith during arbitration.
positive software argument,therefore,fails according to the court own findings.because camiña conduct was neither before the district court nor in direct defiance of its orders,the conduct is beyond the reach of the court inherent authority to sanction.
not only are the sanctions at odds with our caselaw on inherent authority,but they also are in serious tension with the federal arbitration act faa,et.under the faa,the district court has the authority to determine whether arbitration should be compelled,see,and whether an arbitration award should be confirmed,vacated,or modified,see.beyond those narrowly defined procedural powers,the court has no authority to interfere with an arbitration proceeding.see smith,barney,harris upham robinson,cir per curiam.because both parties agree that their contract gave the arbitrator authority to sanction camiña for conduct,the faa counsels against the district court assigning itself that task.
positive software cites laprade kidder peabody,to resolve the apparent tension between the sanction order and the faa.in laprade,the district court stayed an action brought by linda laprade against her former employer because the dispute was covered by a valid arbitration agreement.while the arbitration was pending,laprade attorney went into state court and obtained an ex parte order staying the arbitration without informing that court of the district court previous order.on the employer motion,the district court lifted the state court stay and imposed sanctions against laprade attorneys under for their vexatious and dilatory tactics.laprade,at.on appeal,the district of columbia circuit upheld the sanctions,concluding that the faa did not divest the district court of jurisdiction to enter the sanctions order.id.at.
laprade,however,does not support the district court exercise of inherent power against camiña.first,laprade held only that the faa does not affect the district court jurisdiction over a case stayed pending arbitration.id.but jur
