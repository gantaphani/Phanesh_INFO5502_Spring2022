this appeal stems from a suit by madison hobley against the city of chicago,former chicago police jon burge,and other individual defendants.hobley served years on death row before he was pardoned in.in his suit he alleges that burge and several subordinates tortured and framed him for an arson crime he did not commit.burge was fired from the police force in for allegedly torturing a confession from a murder suspect.the question we decide in this interlocutory appeal is whether hobley may gain discovery of certain documents created and maintained by the law firm jones day when it represented the city in the police board proceedings that led to burge dismissal.
the seeds for this dispute were sown several months before hobley filed his suit.in december,a lawyer in the city corporation counsel office notified jones day attorney june ghezzi that a special prosecutor was investigating allegations of torture by chicago police officers and that a grand jury had subpoenaed documents from the police board proceedings against burge.jones day identified boxes of documents and sent all but of them to hinshaw culbertson,the firm representing the city at that time.ghezzi informed a hinshaw attorney that jones day was retaining five boxes of documents it considered privileged under the attorney doctrine.
an attorney asserting privilege must timely support that claim with a privilege log which describes the nature of each document being withheld.ghezzi told the hinshaw attorney to let her know when a privilege log was needed and to inform her before any of the boxes of nonprivileged materials were produced to anyone.she would hear nothing further for more than a year.the five boxes of claimed documents at the center of this dispute have never left jones day custody.
hobley filed this suit,alleging a deprivation of his constitutional rights under,in may of.once it got going,the record indicates a history of discovery blunders and resistance on the city side,prompting several court orders,periodic from the magistrate judge and at least one set of sanctions against a hinshaw attorney.in december,the city waived any claims to either or privilege.in january,the city produced to hobley the boxes of police board documents that originally had been assembled for the grand jury investigation.although the city attorneys knew jones day was still holding five boxes under a claim of privilege,they made no mention of these to hobley attorneys,who understandably assumed they were getting all of the police board documents they requested,not just some of them up to this point,no one from the city had told jones day about hobley lawsuit.
on february,a hinshaw attorney,steven puiszis,called jones day ghezzi and asked her to prepare a privilege log for the five boxes of documents the firm set aside more than a year earlier.puiszis later testified that he needed the log to help clear up a different discovery city inadvertent production to hobley of privileged documents unrelated to the police board that he gave ghezzi no warning that jones day work product was about to take center stage in the vexed saga of this litigation.representatives from hinshaw and jones day exchanged several other communications during the next several weeks.it remains a point of vigorous dispute whether jones day learned enough information during this time to figure out that the withheld police board documents were in play and that it was in danger of losing its privilege claim if it did bring the materials to hobley attention.hobley argues that jones day knew or should have known about his suit by late february or early march.jones day insists it had no knowledge of the specifics of hobley litigation or that the documents it was holding might have been implicated in discovery requests and court orders that had been going on for months.
meanwhile,in the course of briefing yet a different discovery wrinkle,the city disclosed for the first time on march,that its former counsel was holding some police board documents under a claim of privilege.in an order on april,the magistrate judge said the city should have realized those five boxes were encompassed by earlier discovery requests and ordered that they be produced pronto.
this order got jones day attention.its attorneys filed appearances and a privilege log and asked the judge to reconsider her order.instead,the judge held an evidentiary hearing focused on what jones day had learned about the hobley litigation during the preceding months and whether it had moved properly to protect its privilege claim.dismissing as not credible the firm assertion that it was unaware of the hobley proceedings until it received a copy of the april,order,and clearly exasperated by all the discovery folderol on the city side,the magistrate judge found,on jones day request for reconsideration,that the firm had withheld the documents without a proper notice of privilege.hobley burge.she imposed a sanction of waiver and ordered that the five boxes be produced to hobley attorneys.id.at.the district court,finding that the order was not clearly erroneous,affirmed.
we review discovery sanctions for abuse of discretion.maynard nygren,cir.a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law,and while factual findings are usually reviewed for clear error,findings which are bound up with the application of an inapposite legal standard are subject to closer review.id.
the purpose of the qualified privilege for attorney work product,which is codified in federal rule of civil procedure b,is to establish a zone of privacy in which lawyers can analyze and prepare their client case free from scrutiny or interference by an adversary.in re special grand jury ii,cir see also hickman taylor.it also prevents a litigant from taking a free ride on the research and thinking of his opponent lawyer.united states frederick,cir.a majority of courts have held and hobley does not dispute that the privilege endures after termination of the proceedings for which the documents were created,especially if the old and new matters are related.see in re grand jury proceedings,cir in re murphy,and cir.
it is that the privilege may be invoked by either the client or the attorney.in re special grand jury ii,at in re sealed case.an attorney has an independent interest in privacy,even when the client has waived its own claim,as long as invoking the privilege would not harm the client interests.restatement third of the law governing lawyers cmt.c.although the city has abandoned its own privilege claims,jones day claim is not inconsistent with the city interests in this litigation.
to begin with the obvious,jones day is not a party to hobley suit,nor is it representing the city.when documents are sought from a nonparty,the usual method of compelling production is via a subpoena under.see.c charles wright,et,federal practice and procedure the subpoena duces tecum is the only way to compel a nonparty to produce documents or other materials.this includes work product held by a nonparty attorney.see hickman,at.d.thus,after the city revealed that five boxes of documents were still in the hands of its former counsel,one might have expected hobley attorneys to serve jones day with a rule subpoena.
under that scenario,though,hobley likely would have had to litigate.the privilege may be overcome only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.b.and so instead,hobley attorneys evidently decided to go after the whole cache in one swoop by arguing that jones day had slept on its rights.
the magistrate judge based her sanction order on,which governs requests for documents in the possession,custody or control of one opponent.a.yet,by its terms,rule applies only to parties.it is the city,not jones day,that is the responsive party in this suit.and even if jones day were the city current counsel,rule would not be the correct discovery tool for gaining access to work product held by an attorney.hickman,at.e
