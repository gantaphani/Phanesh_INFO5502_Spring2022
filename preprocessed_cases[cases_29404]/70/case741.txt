the black historical society society filed a petition for a writ of mandate challenging the approval of a housing development on a site with historical significance.however,the society failed to obtain or file with the court a copy of the administrative record or an opening brief.its failure was based on a belief it was not required to pay the costs of preparing the record despite statutory law and a court order to the contrary.because the society failed to obtain the record or file a brief and because there were time constraints for financing of the housing project,the court granted a motion to dismiss the society petition in october.we affirm.
the city of san diego the city issued a development permit to wakeland housing and development wakeland to construct apartments along j street in the east village district of san diego that,in part,had been designated a local historic resource site.wakeland had been allocated federal and california tax credits for the project conditioned on construction starting no later than november.if wakeland missed the november,deadline,it would not only lose the tax credits,but also lose a performance deposit,and would receive negative points for that would hinder wakeland ability to obtain tax credits for other projects.
the society filed a petition for a writ of mandate challenging the permit in march,naming the city,san diego city council,and city of san diego redevelopment agency as defendants,and wakeland and centre city development corporation as real parties in interest.in its second amended petition,the society alleged causes of action based on the failure to implement california environmental quality act ceqa guidelines within the city,violations of environmental quality implementation procedures,violations of the city municipal land development code,and violations of the standards for using funds from the horton plaza redevelopment project.
on june,the society requested the city prepare the administrative record and deliver it within days.the city asked the society to provide a deposit for preparation of the record.in early august,after the society indicated it intended to seek a waiver of costs for preparing the administrative record,the city told the society it was incurring costs in preparing the record,and code of civil procedure sections,subdivision a and,subdivision c required the society to pay for the costs of preparing the record,and requested the society inform the city how it intended to proceed.thereafter,in response to the society request,the city provided the society with cost estimates for preparation of the record and renewed the request for a deposit.on august,following a hearing,the court ordered the parties to meet and confer as to the cost of the administrative record,as to an expedited briefing schedule and to notify the court whether the case was brought under ceqa.
on september,the city sent a letter to the society stating the administrative record was complete and available for review.also on september,the court ordered the society to bear the costs of preparing the administrative record and set a briefing schedule requiring the society to file an opening brief by september.
on september,after the city had certified the administrative record,the court ordered the society to meet and confer with the city within hours as to payment for the record.the city and the society conferred but their positions remained unchanged.the society told the city it would be setting an ex parte hearing to address the issue but did not do so.
the society brought an ex parte application requesting an extension of time to file its opening brief.the society argued it needed days to prepare the brief after the administrative record was released.the briefing schedule was altered to allow the society until october,to file its opening brief days after the court ordered the record to be certified and the time for wakeland response was shortened.
when the society failed to file an opening brief by october,wakeland brought an ex parte motion for dismissal for lack of prosecution.the defendants filed papers in support of the motion to dismiss.the society opposed the motion,claiming it had been prevented from filing its brief by the city,because the city had held the society copy of the administrative record ransom for full payment of the administrative record as calculated by the city.the society did not dispute that the cost of preparing the administrative record should be awarded to the prevailing party or that it would be proper for a petitioner to pay for the reasonable costs of preparing the administrative record upon its receipt when petitioner can bear the costs.the society also objected to the court acceptance of wakeland ex parte application for a noticed motion,and shortening time for a noticed motion to address the subject in wakeland application.
the court granted wakeland motion to dismiss following a hearing on october.the court stated 
a n order was made on september that the society pay for the administrative record.since that date,september,there has been no request for review of that order,there has been no challenge to that order,there has been no request to reconsider that order,there has been no request for clarification of that order.the position of the city has been constant throughout this proceeding in regard to its position to release the record upon payment.
no motion to modify the order of september has been made,and i note that today i have no motion made by the society to modify the order that was made september.
discussion 
idismissal of appeal 
respondents contend we should dismiss the appeal because the society failed to timely file its opening appellate brief.
the society opening brief on appeal was originally due in early february,but upon a motion by the society,we granted an extension.on march,we filed the society request for extension.the society represented the parties were engaged in negotiations likely to result in a settlement of the appeal.the society appended a february,letter from the city to the society stating a draft settlement agreement was attached and city staff was reviewing the terms of the settlement.we granted an extension,thus giving the society until late may to file its opening brief.this extension was granted before wakeland had time to respond.wakeland opposed the extension,stating it was not in negotiations with the society and would not settle this matter.wakeland appended a march,letter from the society to the city indicating the society was only willing to settle if all parties agreed to a settlement.on march,we rescinded the extension and modified the due date for the society opening brief to april.on april,the society filed a letter with this court complaining we had demonstrated an un willingness to be impartial in this case.when we took no action in response to this letter,the society filed an emergency petition for writ of mandate with the california supreme court seeking a change of venue based on the asserted failure of this court to be impartial.the supreme court denied the petition in april and we filed a copy of the denial on april.on april,the society finally filed its opening brief.
california rules of court rule a requires a notice be sent when a brief is not timely filed,stating the brief must be filed within days or the appeal could be dismissed.essentially,there is a grace period a party need not file for an extension or relief from default if the brief can be filed within the time prescribed by rule.see rule b advisory com,pt.west,rules foll.rule.
the society brief was filed on april,within days of the april due date and the day after we filed the order from the supreme court denying the society petition.we consider the society brief to be timely filed within the rule period.accordingly,we decline to dismiss the appeal on this basis.
a ex parte application for dismissal 
the society contends wakeland ex parte application for dismissal was defective because there was no showing of immediate harm to excuse the filing of a noticed motion.see rule g.
we find this argument disingenuous.the society in its own memorandum opposing di
