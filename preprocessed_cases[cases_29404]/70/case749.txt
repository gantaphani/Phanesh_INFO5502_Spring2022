geoffrey mousseau appeals from two orders awarding combined discovery sanctions of more than to sears,roebuck and based on mousseau refusal to comply with deposition and document production subpoenas.mousseau also appeals from an order rejecting his peremptory challenge to the discovery referee who considered the first of the two sanctions motions and recommended that the trial court impose sanctions.code civ.for the reasons set forth below,we dismiss the appeal as to the second sanctions motion and the peremptory challenge issue,and affirm the first sanctions award.
facts and procedural history 
sears,roebuck and sued for bad faith when its union fire insurance company of to pay sears claim for the theft of million from sears by focus media,an advertising agency that sears had once hired.lawyer geoffrey mousseau represented some of focus media principals,nonparty witnesses who had been subpoenaed as part of sears discovery efforts.evidence developed during discovery led sears to believe that mousseau had helped national union develop a defense to sears insurance claim.in order to learn more about mousseau conduct,sears lawyers served him with five subpoenas,some directing him to turn over numerous documents on september,and some directing him to appear for deposition and produce the same documents on september.
on november,sears filed a motion to compel discovery,along with a request for monetary and contempt sanctions,contending that mousseau had not complied with the various subpoenas.that motion was filed with retired california chief justice malcolm lucas,who had been appointed discovery referee for all purposes in sears action against national union.
mousseau first response was a peremptory challenge to chief justice lucas,stating that lucas was biased against him.code civ,subd.a.sears objected that mousseau challenge was filed too late and that,as a nonparty,he lacked standing to challenge the referee.mousseau replied that once sears sought contempt sanctions,he became a party to that new,special proceeding,which vested him with the right to challenge lucas.
mousseau later opposition to the merits of the discovery motion was based on a typographical error in sears document production subpoenas although those subpoenas directed mousseau to produce the requested documents at the address of sears lawyers,they also directed him to produce the documents to the deposition officer,then mistakenly identified mousseau as the deposition officer.according to mousseau,he fully complied with the document subpoenas because,in accordance with their instructions,he delivered the specified documents to himself.mousseau contended that sears motion was aimed at only the document production subpoenas,not the deposition subpoena.mousseau contended,however,that sears cancelled the deposition when a proposed deal calling for mousseau advance production of the requested documents fell through.
declarations and correspondence submitted in sears moving and reply papers told a different story.when synthesized,they show sears lawyers trying to pin down mousseau regarding whether he would appear for the september deposition as scheduled,with the lawyers agreeing to mousseau alternate date of october,as well.sears evidence showed that the deposition was cancelled in order to avoid unnecessary costs only because mousseau refused to confirm whether he would attend.they also show frantic attempts to contact mousseau and ask why he missed the september document production deadline.during phone conversations with one of sears lawyers during the week of september,mousseau acknowledged his failure to produce the documents on time and promised to deliver them by courier on september.he did not.on october,mousseau faxed to sears lawyers a letter dated september stating that he had complied with the document subpoenas by producing the documents to himself.in response to an october letter from sears lawyers that recounted these events,mousseau sent a fax on november that stated your letter requested my assistance.i presumed my silence would have spoken sufficiently loudly to you.since you did not get the message,let me be more clear i decline.the faxed letter restated mousseau insistence that he had complied with the document subpoenas and that sears had cancelled his deposition due to a scheduling conflict.at no time before october did mousseau express any doubts about his obligations under the document production subpoenas.
on january,justice lucas found that because mousseau was present when lucas was first appointed the discovery referee,and had appeared before him on behalf of nonparty witnesses several times since then,mousseau peremptory challenge was brought too late,subd.b a peremptory challenge to discovery referee must be made within days of the appointment or days after the objecting party first appears before the referee.justice lucas also found that because mousseau was not a party to the action,he had no standing to bring a peremptory challenge.as for sears sanctions motion,justice lucas found that mousseau contention that he complied with the subpoenas by producing the requested documents to himself was not made in good faith.based on these findings,lucas recommended that the trial court deny mousseau peremptory challenge and award sears monetary sanctions of the referee also recommended that mousseau be ordered to comply fully with the document production subpoenas and make himself available for deposition.he did not,however,recommend contempt sanctions.
in response to the referee report,mousseau filed with the trial court written objections that essentially mirrored his earlier positions in regard to his peremptory challenge and his opposition to sears sanctions motion.sears filed an opposition brief that also included a request for more sanctions based on the need to respond to mousseau continued reliance on legal arguments sears considered frivolous.on march,the trial court adopted the referee recommendations and awarded sears sanctions of.on march,mousseau appealed from that order and the denial of his peremptory challenge to justice lucas.on april,the court granted sears second sanctions motion and awarded further sanctions of against mousseau.on appeal,mousseau contends that his peremptory challenge was both proper and timely,and that the court erred by granting sears two sanctions motions.
discussion 
the peremptory challenge portion of the appeal must be dismissed 
a peremptory challenge to a judge,commissioner or referee may be filed by a party or a party lawyer,subd.a.the challenge must be accompanied by an affidavit stating,in essence,that the party or lawyer believes the judge is prejudiced against him,subd.a.when the challenge is made to an discovery referee,it must be made within days of the referee appointment,or days after the party first appears before the referee,subd.b a.a ruling regarding the disqualification of a judge is not an appealable order and may be reviewed only by a writ of mandate from the appropriate court of appeal sought within days of notice to the parties of the decision,subd.d.
writ review is the exclusive avenue of appellate review for such rulings.the fundamental public policy underlying the rule is twofold first,it promotes judicial economy by eliminating the waste of time and money that might result if litigation were allowed to continue,only to be vacated later on appeal because the later rulings and judgment were declared void by virtue of a disqualification motion.second,it prevents a party from obtaining a windfall by waiting for the outcome of litigation,then challenging a disqualification only if the result were unfavorable.therefore,section,subdivision d promotes fundamental fairness by ensuring that the parties receive a speedy appellate determination by way of writ of mandate.people hull cal th,d.
instead of following this procedure,however,mousseau filed a notice of appeal as to both the sanctions order and his peremptory challenge although we have discretion to treat mousseau appeal as a writ of mandate,that discretion should be exercised only in extraordinary circumstances.associates th,d.those circum
