this appeal arises after fourteen years of litigation concerning public transit in los angeles county.in,the labor community strategy center and other los angeles county community organizations and local residents,known collectively as the bus riders union or bru,brought a civil rights class action against the county metropolitan transit authority,charging the mta with unlawfully discriminating against and transit dependent bus riders in its allocation of public transportation resources.the case did not go to trial rather,in,the parties agreed to,and the district court approved,a consent decree that committed mta to implementing a detailed plan to improve bus service.see strategy ctr.county metro.trans,cir labor community.the district court jurisdiction over the decree was explicitly set to expire in ten years.
shortly before the tenth anniversary of the decree,bru moved to extend the duration of the decree on the grounds that mta had allegedly failed to comply with the decree overcrowding provisions.bru also sought civil contempt sanctions against mta for mta alleged failure to comply with a remedial order.ruling that mta had substantially complied with the decree,the district court denied bru motion seeking these remedies and allowed the decree to expire.
we hold today that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying bru motion to extend the decree and for contempt sanctions.we therefore affirm the district court decision in all respects.
background 
a.the underlying lawsuit 
in,bru filed a class action under several federal civil rights statutes charging mta with violating the fourteenth amendment by discriminating against low income and minority residents of los angeles county.the alleged discrimination included expending a disproportionately high share of its resources on commuter rail services,whose primary users were wealthy,and a disproportionately low share on bus services,whose main patrons were low income and minority residents 
in march,the district court certified a plaintiff class of a ll poor minority and other riders of mta buses who are denied equal opportunity to receive transportation services because of the mta operation of a discriminatory mass transportation system.on the eve of trial the parties submitted a proposed consent decree,which the district court approved on october.see,at.
b.the consent decree 
the decree committed mta to a wide array of improvements in its bus services,including instituting new bus lines to and from centers of employment,education,and health care in the county enhancing security on buses improving bus shelters and maintaining its fares at specific levels.bru present appeal does not directly concern those aspects of the decree.
bru does contest mta compliance with section of the decree,which committed mta to r educing o vercrowding b y a dding n ew s ervice.the decree did not set out a specific number of buses or hours of service the mta needed to add to achieve appropriate reductions in overcrowding.instead,the decree set forth specific load factor targets,to be met by specific dates,and provided mta with discretion in determining how the targets w ould be met.a load factor is a numerical representation of the number of people standing and sitting on a bus in relation to the number of seats,at.for example,a bus which contained passengers would have a load factor of.under the terms of the decree,mta was required to reduce the maximum load factor for each relevant bus line to by december,by june,and by june.
in addition to these substantive provisions,the decree included a number of procedural mechanisms designed to assure implementation and enforcement.four are relevant to this appeal.
first,the decree created a joint working group,composed of representatives from bru and mta.the purpose of the working group was to foster cooperation in the implementation of the decree and to resolve disputes between the parties.
second,section v of the decree established the position of special master,to facilitate the resolution of disputes arising under any provision of this consent decree that could not be settled by the working group.the parties agreed that donald bliss would serve as the initial special master.
third,section vi,entitled modification of the consent decree,set forth the conditions under which the decree may be modified.under section vi,a party seeking modification must show that a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the consent decree,and that the proposed revision or revisions are suitably tailored to the changed circumstances.
finally,section viii provided that the district court shall retain jurisdiction over this litigation for ten years from the date of approval of this consent decree in order to monitor compliance with this consent decree.the court approved the decree on october,so the court obligatory retention of jurisdiction was set to terminate on october.section viii stated further that 
at the end of seven years,mta may file a motion with the district court to terminate the consent decree and the court shall grant such motion if mta shows to the court satisfaction that it has substantially complied with the consent decree and that it has in place a service plan that will enable continued adherence to the principles and objective of the consent decree during the five years subsequent to the termination of this consent decree.
c.the and orders 
in september,the members of the working group agreed that on out of the bus lines monitored,mta had not met the initial load factor target of by the december,deadline.see,at.as the parties representatives could not agree on a remedial plan to address this failure,and also to ensure that mta would meet the second target of by june,the special master issued an order on march,mandating a plan which,as later revised,required,among other things,that mta acquire additional buses.id.at.
mta sought review of the order,questioning both the special master authority to impose it and the validity of the factual findings and interpretation of the decree on which it was premised.id.the district court upheld the special master findings regarding the agency noncompliance with the load factor target as not clearly erroneous,and affirmed the order as to the buses that mta was required to purchase to meet the target.at the same time,the district court declared it too early to determine whether the mta is incapable of meeting the load factor target,so it vacated the special master order with regard to the remaining additional buses and directed the special master to reevaluate the need for those buses once more data were available.we affirmed the district court order in.at.
on january,the special master promulgated another order addressing measures necessary for mta to achieve compliance with the load factor targets.the final order on remedial service plan to meet and load factor target requirements specified that i n order to achieve compliance with the consent decree and to meet and maintain the load factor target,mta was required to provide the additional buses and service hours called for by the working group.the order permitted mta to meet some of the additional requirements through changes to existing services and more efficient scheduling of its existing fleet.but it required mta to purchase the vehicular equivalent of new expansion buses and to provide an additional annual hours.the final order stated that providing this expanded service,along with the other improvements specified,would constitute substantial compliance with the load factor targets of the consent decree and create a presumption that its expansion bus procurement requirements have been met.
d.the district court ruling 
in february,the special master resigned.although bru and mta agreed on a replacement,the district court did not appoint a new special master,citing the limited amount of time remaining before the court is divested of jurisdiction over the decree.the court indicated,however,that if its jurisdiction is extended,it will revisit this issue.
after the district court declined to appoint a new special master,bru filed motions to extend the duration of the decree and for contempt sanctions the district court denied both.it concluded that contempt sanctions were inappropriate because bru had failed to satisfy its burden of establish ing,by clear and convincing evidence,that mta either failed to substantially comply with the final order or failed to take all reasonable steps to insure compliance with the final order.on the contrary,the court held,it is clear that mta has substantially complied,and taken all reasonable steps within its power to insure compliance,with the final order.
moreover,the district court stated,extension of the decree was unnecessary because the decree did not require perfection,and d espite an increasing ridership,increasing traffic congestion and fiscal constraints,mta has substantially complied with the consent decree while maintaining fares at reasonable levels.the district court concluded that the decree has served its purpose and will not be extended.bru timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court interpretation of a consent decree de novo,with deference based on the court extensive oversight of the decree from the commencement of the litigation to the current appeal.nehmer dep t of veterans affairs,cir.both a district court refusal to extend a consent decree and its denial of a motion for contempt are reviewed for abuse of discretion.see thompson dep t of hous.urban,cir hallett morgan,cir david leavitt,cir holland dep t of,cir vanguards of cleveland city of cleveland,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when its equitable decision is based on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding.kenney united states,cir.
iii.discussion 
extension of the decree 
by its express terms,the decree provided for the district court retention of jurisdiction over compliance with the decree only until october,ten years after its execution because the decree contains an express expiration date for the court retention of jurisdiction,any change to that date entails a modification of the decree.see thompson,at holding that extension of a consent decree termination date required modification of the decree.the first issue,then,is whether,and under what conditions,a modification of the decree is permitted.
to answer this question,we turn first to the decree itself.see united states asarco,cir noting that the meaning of a consent decree,like a contract,must be discerned within its four corners.according to section vi of the decree,modification of the decree is permitted only if the party seeking modification establishes that a significant change in circumstances warrants revision and the proposed revision or revisions are suitably tailored to the changed circumstances.the decree further provides that modification may be warranted when changed factual conditions make compliance with the consent decree unworkable or substantially more onerous,and when the changed factual conditions were unforeseen at the time of the entry into this consent decree.perhaps not surprisingly,these requirements are essentially identical to those articulated by the supreme court in rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d,and applied by this court in asarco and other cases involving modifications to consent decrees.see asarco,at hook arizona,cir.so,as provided both by the decree and by the rufo case law,bru requested,extension of the district court jurisdiction over the warranted only if the following four conditions are met.first,bru must establish that a significant change either in factual conditions or in the law occurred after execution of the decree.see asarco,at.second,it must demonstrate that the change was not anticipated at the time it entered into the decree.id.third,it must show that the changed factual circumstance makes compliance with the consent decree more onerous,unworkable,or detrimental to the public interest.id.internal citations omitted.finally,the proposed extension of the decree termination date must be suitably tailored to resolve the problems created by the changed conditions.id.
the failure of substantial compliance with the terms of a consent decree can qualify as a significant change in circumstances that would justify the decree temporal extension.see thompson,at david,at vanguards of cleveland,at holland,at.here,however,after overseeing this case for more than twelve years,the district court concluded that mta had substantially complied with the decree.the court ruled as follows 
for the past ten entire term of the consent parties have disagreed as to how to implement the consent decree,how to reach its objectives,and how to measure its success.in hindsight,the consent decree was a less than perfect document.as a result,it is impossible to achieve absolute compliance.indeed,the special master informed the parties that the consent decree did not require perfection.citation however,it was possible for mta to substantially comply with the consent decree.despite an increasing ridership,increasing traffic congestion and fiscal constraints,mta has substantially complied with the consent decree while maintaining fares at reasonable levels.the consent decree has served its purpose and will be not extended as a result of the consent decree and the efforts of all of the parties,the quality of life has improved for los angeles public transit dependant poor population.
the court finding that the decree had served its purpose reflected a conclusion that it was no longer necessary to involve the federal courts in the operation of the los angeles county bus system.the district court,armed with a decade of knowledge about the case,was uniquely positioned to determine whether there had been substantial compliance.we accord that court decision deference on this issue.see thompson,at noting deferential standard of review in institutional reform cases and stating that o ver time,the district court gains an intimate understanding of the workings of an institution and learns what specific changes are needed within that institution in order to achieve the goals of the consent decree quoting,cir see also ruiz lynaugh,cir discussing deference due district court in institutional reform cases because it is intimately involved in the often complex process of institutional reformation and has the personal knowledge,experience,and insight necessary to evaluate the parties intentions,performances,and capabilities.
moreover,it is bru burden to show otherwise.bru must demonstrate that mta failed to substantially comply with the decree in order to justify its extension.asarco,at stating that burden is on the moving party.in arguing that mta level of compliance was insubstantial,bru focuses exclusively on just one of the decree several requirements,and uses an imperfect and misleading metric to evaluate compliance.further,bru ignores the many ways in which mta met or exceeded its obligations.
although the underlying data measuring bus overcrowding are not in dispute,the parties interpret that data in vastly different ways.bru argues that the data demonstrate compliance rates as low as with the load factor target during and.meanwhile,mta argues the same data supports the conclusion that it achieved a compliance rate with the load factors during the same time period.in some sense,both figures are correct.
bru compliance figures are based on the standard set forth in the decree for identifying instances of violations of the load factor targets.according to the decree,peak load factors are to be determined by computing the highest ratio of total number of passengers to total number of seats achieved during any minute weekday peak period in the peak direction of travel on each bus line.under this metric,if a bus line exceeds the load factor just once during a given quarter,that line is deemed noncompliant for the entire quarter,even if that line met the target at every other measurement that quarter.mta argues that this standard greatly overstates its level of noncompliance,and it offers its own figures to compensate for this limitation.mta states that in,it monitored time periods and found that of those periods experienced no load factors above the target.
bru correctly notes that the figures it cites are based on the compliance standard written into the decree and affirmed by this court in.at.but that standard measures only strict compliance with the load factor compliance with the decree does so in an imprecise manner.that metric is useful for certain types of analyses,such as determining whether there has been full and absolute compliance mta concedes there has not been,but it is not particularly helpful in measuring levels of compliance below,and it fails to accurately capture the extent to which mta did meet the targets during the relevant time periods.
if the question here were simply whether mta had achieved full compliance with the decree,we would use bru proposed standard.but the question is whether there was substantial compliance,a less precise standard that can not be satisfied by reference to one particular figure,while ignoring alternative information.our analysis requires we do more than simply count the number of technical deviations from the decree.instead,we must determine,using a holistic view of all the available information,whether mta compliance with the decree overall was substantial,notwithstanding some minimal level of noncompliance.
in addition to using an imperfect metric to evaluate compliance with the load factor targets,bru also focuses narrowly on that one requirement,as does the dissent,at the expense of giving due weight to the various other requirements under the decree which mta met,and in some cases,exceeded.there is no question that the reduction of bus overcrowding was an important part of the decree.but so were other requirements.as bru counsel described,the decree imposes three essential and core requirements on mta.these are the reduction in bus overcrowding through the load factor targets,new service through an expedited pilot project followed by a new service plan,and a and lowering of bus fares for at least five years.mta exceeded its obligations as to the bus fare and pass requirements,maintaining fares at specified levels for years longer than it was required to do so.and mta has now met its obligations relating to new service requirements.to give some idea of the extent of mta efforts,since the start of the decree,it has added million hours annually,and added over buses to its peak fleet in order to expand its bus service.bru argues that mta achievements in these areas are outweighed by its imperfect compliance with the load factor targets.of course,there is no precise formula describing how best to weigh the various obligations under the decree,and there is no indication that the district court abused its discretion in weighing them as it did.
we note that the de minimis level of noncompliance here is nowhere close to the near total noncompliance in cases in which courts concluded that extensions of the consent decrees were warranted.in thompson,at,there was a near total failure of some defendants to comply with their obligations.those defendants failed to do almost anything that they were required to do under the decree.id.at see also david,at noting that defendant was percent in compliance and percent in noncompliance.in contrast,aside from the imperfect compliance with the load factor targets,mta complied fully with its numerous obligations under the decree.
we hold that bru has failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in finding that mta had substantially complied with the consent decree.the evidence presented supported the district court finding that the imperfections with respect to load factor targets were de minimis in relation to the overall scheme of things.because the first prong of the rufo test fails,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to extend the decree.
our decision is consistent with the principle that federal court intervention in state institutions is a temporary measure and may extend no longer than necessary to cure constitutional violations.see bd.of ed.of.city pub.sch.dowell,d toussaint mccarthy,cir.in this case,as the district court found,perhaps every last wish and hope of the decree was not achieved,but the decree accomplished its essential purposes and the situation improved greatly.these improvements strongly inform our assessment that the district court was within its discretion in holding that it no longer needed to oversee the running of the los angeles county bus system.
bru motion for contempt sanctions 
bru also contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion for civil contempt sanctions against mta for mta alleged failure to comply with the final order.for issuance of a contempt order against mta to be proper,bru must establish that mta violated the court order,beyond substantial compliance,not based on a good faith and reasonable interpretation of the order,by clear and convincing evidence.in re video cassette recorder antitrust,cir.bru argues that mta violated the final order in two ways by failing to allocate all of the newly purchased buses and additional service hours to peak time periods,and by failing to hire any new mechanics.
the final order required that,among other things,mta purchase the vehicular equivalent of new expansion buses and add an additional annual hours.mta did add buses and hours to the bus system.but according to bru,mta violated the final order by failing to allocate all of these resources to peak time periods.mta does not dispute that some of the new hours and buses went to times,but contends that the final order gave mta discretion regarding how to perform the allocation.
upon review of the final order,it is not immediately obvious whether the hours and buses were required to be allocated to peak time periods.there is no express language directing mta to do so and the final order provides mta with discretion to deploy the buses throughout the bus system.even assuming that mta violated the final order by allocating some resources to time periods,the district court was within its discretion in ruling that contempt sanctions were not warranted.there is no evidence that mta conduct was not based on a good faith and reasonable interpretation of the order.see id.
while mta did not add all of the additional hours to peak periods,it did add an estimated annual hours during peak periods and did increase its total annual hours by more than the amount required by the final order.mta also added buses to its fleet as required though it is not clear how many of those buses were added to peak time periods.these efforts rebut any inference that mta was acting in bad faith.in addition,even if mta interpretation of the final order were ultimately deemed incorrect,it was not unreasonable.mta is right that the final order does not literally state that the additional hours and buses must be added during peak times.
bru also argues that mta failure to hire new mechanics violated the final order,which mandated that mta h ire additional mechanics as needed to meet the expansion service requirements.the language as needed renders the directive conditional,and we have no basis to mta conclusion that it had no need to hire more mechanics.it is,for example,undisputed that mta added nearly annual hours after special master bliss issued the final order.the fact that mta increased its hours so significantly without adding mechanics lends substantial credence to its argument that no new mechanics were needed to meet its obligations under the final order.
we hold that bru has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in declining to sanction mta for its alleged violations of the final order.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the district court denial of plaintiffs motion to extend and its denial of plaintiffs motion for civil contempt sanctions are affirmed.
i respectfully dissent.
the defendants simply did not comply,substantially or otherwise,with the consent decree requirements for relieving the overcrowding on buses.the consent decree and the associated orders from the special master spell out in detail the method by which the parties agreed to measure bus overcrowding and define performance targets that mta is required to meet.critically,the decree also expressly prohibits mta from seeking to modify the decree for changed circumstances because of the difficulty meeting targets as set out in the decree.see consent decree the failure of mta to meet target load factors shall not be deemed a changed or unforeseen factual condition for purposes of seeking a modification of this consent decree by mta.
yet,it is just such a modification that mta has in effect granted to itself,and that the majority is willing to countenance.unable to comply with the load factor targets defined in the decree,mta devised its own measure of compliance and then announced that it had met that measure.the district court went along,without explaining why the defendants were entitled to rewrite a provision to which they had consented and which they had contractually agreed not to try to modify.
under these circumstances,i am quite certain,it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to terminate its jurisdiction to enforce the decree.to rule otherwise is to sanction a governmental agency flaunting of the law and breaking of solemn promises.i can agree to neither.
the consent decree 
the majority account of the background of this case is accurate but incomplete.
first,the decree identified the reduction of overcrowding on county buses as one of its critical objective s.the means for accomplishing this objective,and,more importantly,the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in the decree designed to achieve this goal have long been a subject of dispute between the parties.see,strategy ctr.county metro.trans,cir.in this appeal,bru once again contests mta compliance with section of the decree,which committed mta to r educing o vercrowding b y a dding n ew s ervice.
as the majority recites,to measure compliance with this requirement,the decree set forth specific load factor targets,with specified compliance dates for each target,and provided mta with discretion in determining how the targets w ould be met.see op.at for an explanation of the load factor concept.as the majority also explains,the decree included procedural mechanisms to monitor implementation and enforcement.see op.at.
it is not noted by the majority,except in passing,see op.at this is the second time,not the first,that mta has come to this court to complain that the load factor target terms of the decree are too harsh.in,mta argued that the district court had erred in interpreting the load factor target requirements of the decree.see at.the targets,mta asserted,were simply performance goals that mta promised to use its best efforts to meet,but with which the d ecree only required substantial compliance.id.at.we disagreed,holding that mta interpretation of what the decree required was refuted by a reading of the d ecree as a whole.id.the decree,we observed,set out a mathematically precise method of measuring bus overcrowding and a detailed schedule of load factor targets that were to be met by specific dates.id.at.therefore,t o say that mta best efforts are enough for compliance would be to ignore the precise load factor schedule set out in the decree.id.
as i see this case,having failed to persuade us in labor community that the load factor targets were only performance goals to be used to evaluate mta best efforts,mta went forward as if that is all they were.the district court went along with this subversion of the decree,and now the majority does as well.
the special master final order 
in,two years after we issued the opinion,the question of mta failure to meet the load factor targets was once again before the special master.at that point,a lthough the mta ha d made significant service improvements,it was undisputed that,during weekday peak hours the mta did not meet the load factor target of on bus lines,and did not meet the load factor target of on bus lines.moreover,the working group had concluded that meeting the peak hour load factor targets would require the addition of buses and revenue service hours.
once again,the parties could not agree on a specific remedial plan therefore,after first issuing a proposed order to determine points of agreement and elicit modifications,the special master promulgated a final order on remedial service plan to meet and load factor target requirements the final order.as the majority recounts,see op.at,the final order spelled out that i n order to achieve compliance with the consent decree and to meet and maintain the load factor target,mta was required to provide the additional buses and service hours the working group had identified as necessary,and specified how it might do that.in addition,although the final order stated that the mta would have discretion both in how to deploy and schedule the new buses and in allocating the additional inservice hours on specific bus lines and during specific time periods throughout the bus system,the order also made clear that mta should deploy this additional service to meet the objective of alleviating bus overcrowding to achieve the load factor target on each and every bus line.the final order further stated that providing this expanded service,along with the other improvements specified,would constitute substantial compliance with the load factor targets of the consent decree and create a presumption that its expansion bus procurement requirements have been met.in other words,the final order determined what would constitute substantial compliance.mta abandonment of the load factor targets was not sanctioned by the final order.
the district court opinion 
after the district court declined to appoint a new special master,bru filed motions to extend the duration of the decree and for contempt sanctions the district court denied both critically,the paragraph the majority quotes on page from the district court opinion is all the explanation the district court provided.why the district court thought that mta has substantially complied even though it entirely failed to comply according to the measure carefully included in the decree,affirmed by this court,and elaborated upon in the special master final order,we were not told.
as the majority holds,see op.at,lack of substantial compliance qualifies as a significant change in circumstances justifying modification of a consent decree by extending the length of judicial oversight.in my view,the district court unexplained conclusion that there was substantial compliance has no basis in the record,and was therefore clearly erroneous 
before turning to a discussion of mta compliance with the decree since,i note that the majority reliance on the district court decade of knowledge about the case,and its characterization of the district court as uniquely positioned to determine whether there had been substantial compliance,op.at,is grounded largely in fiction.until his resignation in early,special master donald bliss played the central role in monitoring mta compliance with its decree obligations.for example,prior to issuing the remedial order that this court upheld,bliss conducted a painstaking bus line review of mta performance with respect to the load factor target.the order itself included an appendix which identified problems and proposed solutions for individual lines.the special master final order likewise included detailed findings regarding mta compliance with the load factor targets and mandated highly specific remedies.in addition to these orders,special master bliss issued literally dozens of detailed opinions and memoranda related to compliance issues.so,in fact,it was the special master,not the district court judge,who had been overseeing the consent decree on a basis,who was intimately familiar with both its provisions and its application,and who had issued the key orders interpreting and implementing the decree.
moreover,with the resignation of the special master and judge hatter refusal to appoint a new one even though the parties had agreed on a replacement,specific findings of the type that permeated special master bliss orders were not available to the district court in deciding the motions that underlie this appeal and are not available to us now.bliss himself does not appear to have updated his analysis of mta compliance with the load factor targets before his resignation in.and,although it is possible that the district court performed a detailed review of mta compliance before issuing its order denying bru motion to extend,its terse opinion does not reveal that it did,suggest what that review entailed,or indicate what facts were found 
at a minimum,the majority should have remanded for some elucidation of the district court fact findings and legal reasoning before accepting its unexplained conclusions.but the majority does not do so.
mta compliance with the load factor requirements 
notwithstanding the limitations just discussed,the evidence that is available clearly reveals that mta has not substantially complied with its commitments under the decree.specifically,mta abysmally failed to meet the current load factor target,a critical objective of the decree.several facts demonstrate the broad extent of mta noncompliance.
first,as of the final report,mta did not dispute that it had failed to meet the load factor target in and on a significant number of its bus lines during peak hours,and that remedial measures were warranted.this conclusion,reached by the joint working group,affirmed by the special master,and not appealed to the district court by mta,rested on an analysis of data collected by mta.
second,the updates to this data reveal that mta remains substantially noncompliant.for example,data from and show that mta failed to meet the target on approximately out of monitored bus lines,a noncompliance rate of almost.see david leavitt,cir concluding that an noncompliance rate qualified as substantial noncompliance and merited modification of the decree vanguards of cleveland city of cleveland,cir holding that noncompliance rates of between and were substantial enough to warrant modification under rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d.
tellingly,mta does not dispute this data or suggest that it was either collected or analyzed in a manner different from that employed by the working group and the special master in.rather,mta the majority an entirely different approach can be used to analyze the data for purposes of determining substantial compliance with the consent decree,and that this new approach demonstrates that mta is now in substantial compliance with the targets.
there are,however,several problems with the approach mta espouses and the,with no inquiry at all into its upon.first,mta methodology,even if accepted at face value,does not reveal an identifiable change in the rate of mta compliance with the load factor targets between,a period for which mta agreed that it was not substantially compliant,and now,when it claims to have achieved substantial compliance.for instance,according to mta new methodology and its own calculations,the agency was in compliance with the load factor target of the time in the third quarter of and of the time in the fourth quarter of.mta own calculations using this same methodology indicate,however,that mta was compliant with the load factor target in the third quarter of,compliant in the fourth quarter of that year,and compliant in the third quarter of.indeed,a comparison of mta revised and calculations with its figures shows virtually no change in mta rate of compliance.yet,as discussed above,mta did not dispute in that it was not substantially compliant with the targets in and.in other words,mta new methodology supports bru argument that mta is no more compliant with the load factor targets now than it was when the special master issued the final order,finding that there had not yet been substantial compliance and setting out standards for judging substantial compliance in the future 
in addition to failing to demonstrate any increase in its rate of compliance with the load factor targets,mta proposed methodology suffers from fundamental conceptual deficiencies.mta readily acknowledges that its approach provides an aggregate measure of compliance with the target,by averaging performance across bus lines.however,as special master bliss repeatedly stated,section ii of the decree requires that the load factors be met on each and every bus line.final order at emphasis added.thus,mta methodology does not provide adequate information for adducing its compliance with the decree.
the authority approach also averages peak and hour data.once again,such averaging runs counter to the express language of the decree,which specifically requires that the agency meet the load factor targets during both peak hours and hours.in other words,mta can not demonstrate substantial compliance by averaging low compliance rates in peak hours with high compliance rates in hours.it must achieve high compliance rates on each relevant bus line during both peak and periods to substantially comply with decree,as just some average what the decree required.
despite these significant problems with its approach,mta contends that its method is superior to bru because,according to mta,bru methodology misleading ly identifies a bus line as noncompliant for a given quarter if that line exceeds the target even once in that quarter.mta argument is unpersuasive for two reasons.first,the special master agreed with bru that a single measured exceedence renders a bus line noncompliant.see final order at for example,monitored bus lines exhibited one or more exceedences above lft in moreover,monitored bus lines exhibited one or more exceedences above load factor target.emphasis added.second,mta own methodology suggests that each line exceeds the load factor target more than once per quarter.for example,in the first quarter of,mta data show there were measured exceedences across monitored bus lines.this number of exceedences equates to just over measured exceedences per line per quarter.the number of exceedences on these lines jumps to,or more than per line per quarter,by the fourth quarter of that same year.in short,even if mta is correct in characterizing bru methodology as misleading a characterization the majority echoes,even though the methodology is the one employed by special master own data and methodology suggest that it frequently exceeds the load factor targets.
the majority does not recognize any of these deficiencies in mta statistical showing,maintaining that the parties simply interpret the data in different ways,and that both parties figures are correct.op.at.that simply can not be.
the load factor targets,measured as bru measures them,are in the decree they are not simply external measures of compliance with more general goals contained in the decree.so,in effect,far from using a holistic view of all available the information,op.at,to judge compliance with the decree,the majority would sanction an implicit,unilateral,substantive modification of the consent decree at the behest of the defendants,changing the method agreed upon by the parties for determining how the overcrowding problem would be solved.moreover,the decree,as interpreted by the special master with the approval of this court,prescribed the manner in which the targets are to be understood and applied.to call that prescribed methodology an imperfect and misleading metric,op.at,and then ignore it is to rewrite the decree.it is that metric,imperfect or otherwise,the parties chose and the district court adopted,not some other.
using the decree methodology,the defendants were not in substantial compliance.only by altering the decree methodology can one come to an opposite conclusion.put another way,although the methodology defendants suggest and the majority would sanction could have been the way of curing the overcrowding problem,it was not.that is why it is only by substantively modifying the consent decree that the defendants could have reached the result they support and that the majority approves.
but the defendants did not move for such a modification.the reason,in all likelihood,is that they were precluded by the decree itself from doing so.
section of the decree provides that the failure of mta to meet the target load factors shall not be deemed a changed or unforeseen factual condition for purposes of seeki
