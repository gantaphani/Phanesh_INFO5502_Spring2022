san jose construction,in addition to arguing the merits of the case,has brought a separate motion for sanctions against foust on the basis that the appeal is frivolous.cal.rules of court,rule a.
foust showing on appeal is insufficient and we shall affirm the judgment.we also find that the appeal is frivolous and award sanctions against foust.
factual and procedural background 
we take our recitation of the facts from the trial court statement of decision.
in,san jose construction hired foust as a project manager pursuant to a written employment agreement the letter agreement.the letter agreement provided for a base salary of per year,a signing bonus,an annual bonus of to be paid quarterly,as well as certain other benefits including car and cell phone allowances.it also provided for a performance bonus of percent of all gross profits over generated by foust projects.
on his first day of employment,foust signed a copy of san jose construction policies and procedures handbook,which specified that his employment was at will and that san jose construction reserved the right to adjust salaries on a selective merit basis.
in,san jose construction paid foust his salary and annual bonus as set forth in the letter agreement.no performance bonus was earned or paid.in the first half of,foust was paid his salary and two quarterly bonus payments of.after he received his second quarterly bonus payment,foust salary was increased from to,but no further quarterly bonus payments were made that year.
in september and december of,foust prepared written outlines of his compensation for that year.both outlines noted the increase in his salary,and reflected a different performance bonus formula from that set forth in the letter agreement.foust testified that he prepared these outlines at the request of san jose construction president,pat dimanto and was told he would not receive a bonus if he did not do so.foust testified that he did not know why his compensation had been changed,but indicated that dimanto told him that he was going to make good on this every couple of months so he was not concerned.foust made no written complaint about his compensation and continued working at san jose construction.
in february,foust salary was increased to and his car and cell phone allowances were also increased.in the spring of,dimanto had a lunch meeting with all of the san jose construction project managers.all of the witnesses agreed that performance bonuses were discussed at this meeting and dimanto indicated that all such bonuses would be paid on a percent calculation going forward.according to foust,he never accepted this change from the letter agreement,but just listened to what was said at the meeting.
in foust received his salary,no quarterly bonus payments and a percent performance bonus at year end.in december,foust prepared a written summary of his compensation for and.this summary reflected foust salary and the percent performance bonus for both years.in addition,it showed foust had been overpaid in,but that he was due a net bonus of for.again,foust testified that he was told that he should write it up this way or he would get no bonus at all,and he was not happy.foust did not recall what dimanto said about his written summary of compensation for and,but testified that dimanto had said he would find a way to pay me.
in,foust salary was reduced from to.foust testified he had no idea why it was done as no one had a discussion with him about his salary.as to all of the changes in his compensation,foust testified that he understood that this was the deal but he did agree with it.he never put anything in writing objecting to the manner he was paid while working for san jose construction and did not make any claim for unpaid compensation until this lawsuit and after dimanto death.
after first noting that foust claim of breach of contract rests largely on his credibility,the trial court statement of decision lists several examples of how foust trial testimony was not credible.the court found that the letter agreement was modified when foust signed the policies and procedures manual that made him an employee.thereafter,san jose construction unilaterally changed the terms of foust compensation,as it had the right to do for an employee,first in and then in subsequent years and paid foust consistent with those changes.foust knew of these changes and accepted them by continuing to work at san jose construction.therefore,there was no breach of his employment contract.
after judgment was entered in favor of san jose construction,foust timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
a.the incomplete record is fatal to the appeal 
foust argues that the letter agreement was never modified by a writing,there was no mutual assent given to any modification of the terms of that agreement and no consideration was ever given to him in exchange for changing the terms of the agreement.according to foust,his trial testimony was clear that he never agreed to any change in the terms of his compensation and he was repeatedly assured by dimanto that the letter agreement was valid.foust contends that the trial court erred in finding that the letter agreement was modified when he signed san jose construction policy and procedure manual 
the fatal problem with this appeal is that foust fails to provide us with a reporter transcript from his court trial or any other adequate statement of the evidence.the record consists solely of a partial clerk transcript which includes the following documents foust initial complaint his amended complaint the statement of decision the judgment and two of the introduced at trial.generally,appellants in ordinary civil appeals must provide a reporter transcript at their own expense.city of rohnert park superior court d.in lieu of a reporter transcript,an appellant may submit an agreed or settled statement.leslie roe d cal.rules of court,rules.
in numerous situations,appellate courts have refused to reach the merits of an appellant claims because no reporter transcript of a pertinent proceeding or a suitable substitute was provided.maria riles cal d,attorney fee motion hearing ballard uribe cal d,lead opn.of grodin,new trial motion hearing in re kathy cal d,hearing to determine whether counsel was waived and the minor consented to informal adjudication vo las virgenes municipal water dist.th,trial transcript when attorney fees sought estate of fain th,surcharge hearing hodges mark th,nonsuit motion where trial transcript not provided null city of los angeles d,reporter transcript fails to reflect content of special instructions buckhart san francisco residential rent,bd.d,hearing on code civ,petition sui landi d,motion to dissolve preliminary injunction hearing rossiter benoit d,demurrer hearing calhoun hildebrandt d,transcript of argument to the jury ehman moore d,failure to secure reporter transcript of settled statement.
the reason for this follows from the cardinal rule of appellate review that a judgment or order of the trial court is presumed correct and prejudicial error must be affirmatively shown.denham superior court cal d.in the absence of a contrary showing in the record,all presumptions in favor of the trial court action will be made by the appellate court.i f any matters could have been presented to the court below which would have authorized the order complained of,it will be presumed that such matters were presented.bennett mccall th.this general principle of appellate practice is an aspect of the constitutional doctrine of reversible error.state farm fire casualty pietak th.a necessary corollary to this rule is that if the record is inadequate for meaningful review,the appellant defaults and the
