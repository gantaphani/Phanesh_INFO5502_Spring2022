plaintiffs appellees plaintiffs brought a putative class action in the district of idaho under against defendants appellants timothy wengler and the corrections corporation of america,collectively cca,alleging that cca staffed the idaho corrections center icc with an inadequate number of security guards,in deliberate indifference to the health and safety of prisoners.the parties settled,and cca agreed to staff icc with a specified number of security personnel.the district court dismissed the case with prejudice,incorporating the parties settlement agreement into its dismissal order.
after learning that staffing reports at icc had been falsified over a period,plaintiffs moved the district court to hold cca in contempt for violating the dismissal order.after a hearing,the district court found cca in contempt,ordered remedial measures,and awarded plaintiffs attorney fees and costs.cca challenges various aspects of the district court orders,including the award of attorney fees.we affirm.
background 
initial suit and settlement 
icc is a prison in kuna,idaho.when this suit was filed in april,cca operated icc under a contract with the idaho department of corrections idoc.plaintiffs complaint alleged cca failed to hire an adequate number of security guards and,as a result,icc staff failed to protect inmates from assault by other inmates.the complaint alleged cca was deliberately indifferent to the safety and health of icc inmates in violation of the eighth amendment.plaintiffs requested declaratory relief and an injunction ordering,inter alia,that cca hire an adequate number of security personnel.
in september,the parties met with a judicial mediator,district judge david carter of the central district of california.they reached a settlement after three days of negotiation.in a signed settlement agreement,cca agreed to comply with the staffing requirements contained in its contract with idoc.cca also agreed to provide three additional officers,known as the warden crew,whom the warden could use in his discretion to enhance security.the parties signed a stipulation for dismissal.the stipulation incorporated the settlement agreement,which was attached as an exhibit to the stipulation.district judge edward lodge of the district of idaho signed an order on september,dismissing the case with prejudice.his order explicitly incorporated the parties stipulation.
order to show cause 
between december and january,cca and idoc received reports that staffing records at icc had been falsified during the period.idoc initiated an audit of icc staffing records,and cca hired an investigator.on april,idoc issued a press release,stating that cca employees had falsified staffing records to represent that correctional officers were staffing mandatory security posts when,in fact,those posts had been vacant for a total of nearly hours during a period in.that same day,cca issued its own press release stating there were some inaccuracies in its staffing records.
in june,plaintiffs moved in the district court for an order to show cause osc why cca should not be held in contempt for violating the court dismissal order.the district court referred the motion to judge carter,sitting by special designation in the district of idaho.cca opposed the motion,partly on the ground that the district court did not have jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement.the district court held it had jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement and issued the requested osc.
contempt order 
after a hearing,the district court entered an order on september,holding cca in contempt and ordering remedial measures.the order was entered almost exactly two years after the entry of the order dismissing the suit and incorporating the settlement agreement.
the district court found cca had materially breached the settlement agreement and,indeed,that there was serious doubt whether cca had ever substantially complied with it.the court relied in part on cca own investigative report,which indicated that from april to october approximately mandatory post hours had been left vacant.the reported hour figure included only hours during that period.in addition,evidence presented at the hearing showed vacancies had occurred during over the period covered by the report,and additional vacancies had occurred after that period.for example,with respect to vacancies during the period covered by the report,icc warden and defendant timothy wengler testified that cca investigation revealed roughly vacant hours in may and vacant hours in june.idoc official timothy higgins testified that idoc had received reports from inmates at icc that the only time there was full staffing was when our monitors were there.higgins testified,with respect to vacancies after the period covered by the report,that daily staffing reports showed vacant mandatory post hours at icc for june and july ranged from to hours per day.
the district court found further that cca had compelling reasons to regularly and thoroughly check that it was in compliance,and that it knew or should have known it was in material breach of the settlement agreement.before the parties executed the settlement agreement,multiple sources had informed the warden and assistant wardens at icc that the facility was experiencing acute staffing shortages,and indications of icc staffing difficulties continued even after the parties entered into the settlement agreement.according to cca internal investigative report,members of icc senior management were aware of acute personnel shortages in the period,during the spring,summer,and fall of.the report was corroborated by several witnesses who testified they informed cca officials,including warden wengler,about staffing shortages.
finally,the district court found cca had not taken all reasonable steps to comply with the settlement agreement.for example,higgins testified that cca reports of shift rosters indicated whether a post was covered by two or more employees but did not indicate the hours worked by each employee.this manner of reporting made it difficult to determine whether an employee was reported as having been simultaneously posted at more than one post double posted.warden wengler,assistant warden thomas kessler,and managing director kevin myers testified that they neither checked for vacancies nor reviewed staffing records to ensure that the prison was fully staffed.
cca eventually took a number of steps to ensure compliance with the settlement agreement,but it did so only after there had been an investigation into its staffing and recordkeeping.after the investigation,cca implemented a corrective action plan including hiring more guards,maintaining more detailed staffing records,comparing staffing rosters with actual staffing,maintaining open lines of communication about potential staffing difficulties,and reviewing incidents resulting in vacancies.the district court found cca should have taken these measures before the investigation.
the district court ordered several remedial measures.the settlement agreement was supposed to last for only two years,but the court extended it for another two years.the court appointed an independent monitor,to be paid by cca.finally,the court established a fine schedule.under the schedule,cca would be required to pay for each hour that a mandatory post was left vacant in excess of twelve hours in any calendar month.the court indicated it would increase the amount of the fines,if per hour proved insufficient to compel compliance.in the end,the court never imposed fines for noncompliance.the court declined to impose several remedies requested by plaintiffs,including ordering cca to discipline more of its staff,conducting an audit to determine the total number of vacant hours since the execution of the settlement agreement,and requiring the submission of reports to the district court.
attorney fees 
plaintiffs counsel,american civil liberties union aclu attorneys stephen pevar and ritchie eppink,requested attorney fees and costs associated with the contempt proceedings.pevar sought compensation for hours,and eppink sought compensation for hours.they also sought compensation for hours of work performed by legal assistants,as well as in costs.plaintiffs counsel based their attorney fees request on an hourly rate of per hour,which,at the time of the contempt proceedings,was percent of the hourly rate set for counsel appointed in criminal cases,the maximum base rate allowed in cases governed by the prison litigation reform act plra.they based their request for paralegal and fees on an hourly rate of per hour.the court did not award fees for some of the hours plaintiffs counsel claimed because several time entries were vague,but otherwise determined plaintiffs requested hours,rates,and costs were reasonable.
plaintiffs counsel also requested a multiplier of their fees.the court agreed to enhance the fee award,though not by the full amount requested.the court gave two reasons for the enhancement.first,plaintiffs counsel provided superior performance under extreme time pressure and with very limited resources.second,prisoners in idaho have such difficulty obtaining counsel for civil rights cases seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that plaintiffs counsel were likely the only attorneys willing to accept plaintiffs case.
based on evidence of the hourly rates of idaho attorneys with similar experience,the district court applied a multiplier to the fees associated with pevar work and a multiplier to the fees associated with eppink work,on the ground that these fees would compensate plaintiffs counsel for their superior performance and would be sufficient to induce competent idaho attorneys to accept appointment in meritorious prisoner civil rights cases seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.in total,the court awarded in attorney fees and costs.
pursuant to,cca timely appealed the district court orders finding the court had subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement,finding cca in contempt,and awarding attorney fees and costs.see stone city cnty.of san francisco,cir holding that contempt orders imposing sanctions are final for purposes of.

iii.discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
the district court dismissed plaintiffs suit with prejudice after the parties reached a settlement.cca contends the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement because the court jurisdiction terminated when it dismissed the case.in other words,cca maintains the parties agreement is not enforceable in federal court.we disagree.the district court had federal question jurisdiction over plaintiffs suit under the settlement agreement was incorporated into the court dismissal order and the district court therefore had ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement.
federal courts are courts of limited subject matter jurisdiction.a party alleging subject matter jurisdiction has the burden of establishing it.kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d.when a district court dismisses an action with prejudice pursuant to a settlement agreement,federal jurisdiction usually ends.colvin,cir.ordinarily,a dispute arising under a settlement agreement is a separate contract dispute requiring its own independent basis for jurisdiction.id.
however,federal district courts have ancillary jurisdiction over certain matters otherwise beyond their competence that are incidental to other matters properly before them.kokkonen,at.a federal court has jurisdiction to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees.id.at.when a court order dismissing a case with prejudice incorporates the terms of a settlement agreement,the court retains ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement because a breach of the incorporated agreement is a violation of the dismissal order.id.at.
cca contends the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement in this case because the court dismissal order did not incorporate the terms of the settlement agreement.cca is wrong as a matter of law.under federal law,a document incorporated into a dismissal order is part of the order.see saint john organic farm gem cnty.mosquito abatement,cir.the district court order explicitly incorporated the parties stipulation for dismissal.the stipulation is therefore part of the dismissal order.
stipulations for dismissal are construed according to the basic contract principles of local law.jeff andrus,cir.here,we apply idaho contract law,because the parties entered into the stipulation in idaho,plaintiffs are idaho residents,and the stipulation relates to cca business in idaho.under idaho law,incorporation of a document into a contract makes the document part of the contract.city of meridian petra,idaho,idaho.the stipulation for dismissal explicitly incorporated the parties settlement agreement and attached the agreement as an exhibit,thereby making the settlement agreement part of the stipulation.thus,the parties settlement agreement is incorporated into the court dismissal order,and by violating the settlement agreement,cca violated the order.
the district court dismissed this case under federal rule of civil procedure a a ii,which provides that an action may be dismissed when the plaintiff files a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared.the supreme court has held that a district court that dismisses a case under this rule may embody the settlement contract in its dismissal order if the parties agree.kokkonen,at emphasis added.here,the parties agreed the district court would retain ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.paragraph of the agreement establishes a procedure for resolving disputes.under this procedure,the parties must first attempt to resolve the dispute themselves.if they are unable to do so,they must then attempt to resolve the dispute with the alternative dispute resolution coordinator for the district of idaho.if that attempt fails,the parties may submit the dispute to the honorable david carter,who shall have authority to enforce the terms of this agreement in his capacity as a federal district court judge.emphasis added.paragraph thus provides that the district court shall have authority to enforce the agreement once the parties have taken a dispute through the first two steps of the process.
paragraph of the agreement supports this interpretation of paragraph.paragraph provides that the agreement will extend no further than necessary to satisfy the requirements of a a.under this provision of the plra,a federal district court may not order prospective relief unless it finds the relief is narrowly drawn,extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right,and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the federal right.a a id.g defining prospective relief.these limitations on prospective relief do not apply to private settlement agreements.id.c.paragraph reference to a a thus evinces the parties intention to make the settlement agreement enforceable in federal court.we therefore conclude the district court had ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement,the terms of which were incorporated into the district court dismissal order.for convenience,we hereafter refer only to the settlement agreement,with the caveat that the court jurisdiction was based on cca violation of the dismissal order incorporating the agreement terms.
finding of contempt and ordering of remedies 
the district court found by clear and convincing evidence that cca was in civil contempt because it violated the settlement agreement and had failed to take all reasonable steps to comply.it is not seriously disputed that cca was in substantial violation of the settlement agreement.the only serious disputes concern whether cca justified a finding of contempt and whether the remedies ordered were appropriate.because cca has ceased providing staffing for icc,the contempt and remedies ordered by the district court are no longer relevant to cca operation of icc.however,they remain relevant for purposes of cca appeal because the attorney fees award depends on the correctness of the court conclusion that cca was in contempt and on the appropriateness of the remedies ordered.
all reasonable steps 
cca first contends the district court contempt finding was an abuse of discretion because cca implemented a number of corrective measures immediately after discovering that it was not in compliance with the settlement agreement.cca argument is based on a misunderstanding of well established law.
a contemnor in violation of a court order may avoid a finding of civil contempt only by showing it took all reasonable steps to comply with the order.see inst.of cetacean research sea shepherd conservation soc y,cir.cca emphasizes the steps it took to comply with the settlement agreement,but fails to mention other reasonable steps it could have taken.for example,after the parties signed the settlement agreement,cca increased the number of budgeted security staff positions at icc.cca failed,however,actually to fill a substantial number of those budgeted positions.further,although warden wengler convened meetings to review staffing requirements,in some of those meetings he was informed that icc was experiencing acute staffing difficulties.yet cca failed to address those difficulties.finally,cca contends its senior management may not have known that icc staff members were falsifying staffing rosters.cca failed,however,to take all reasonable steps that would have allowed it to discover that records had been falsified.
citing our decision in vertex distributing,falcon foam plastics,cir,cca contends it should not have been found in contempt because it took immediate corrective action after learning of the inaccurate staffing reports.the facts in vertex,however,are far afield from the facts here.in vertex,the plaintiff requested the court find the defendant in contempt for violating a consent judgment that prohibited the defendant from using a particular trade name for publicity purposes.at.although the plaintiff proved the defendant was listed under that name in a local yellow pages directory,in violation of the judgment,we upheld the district court decision not to find the defendant in contempt because the defendant had otherwise complied with the consent judgment and had taken steps to remove the trade name from its yellow pages listing as soon as it discovered the listing.id.at.
here,by contrast,the district court found cca had not substantially complied with the settlement agreement and had failed to take several reasonable steps to ensure compliance.moreover,the court found cca corrective action plan was itself inadequate.indeed,just one month before the contempt proceedings began,mandatory posts at icc were still left vacant between and hours per day.
nature of the sanctions 
cca objects to two of the ordered remedies the extension of the settlement agreement and the prospective fine schedule on the ground that they are criminal sanctions and that the district court did not follow procedures that would have allowed it to hold cca in criminal contempt.
unlike civil contempt,criminal contempt requires the procedural safeguards applicable in criminal proceedings,including proof beyond a reasonable doubt.hanshaw,emerald river,cir.it is undisputed that when the district court found cca in contempt the court did not provide all of the procedural protections required in criminal proceedings.thus,if the district court contempt finding and the associated remedies were criminal in nature,the finding and remedies were improper and would have to be reversed.
whether contempt is civil or criminal turns on the nature of the sanction or sanctions involved.int l union,united mine workers bagwell bagwell,d.a sanction generally is civil if it coerces compliance with a court order or is a remedial sanction meant to compensate the complainant for actual losses.a criminal sanction,in contrast,generally seeks to punish a completed act of disobedience.ahearn ex rel.int l longshore warehouse union,locals,cir quoting bagwell,at.
we conclude the extension of the settlement agreement is a compensatory civil sanction.rather than punishing cca,this sanction sought to return plaintiffs as nearly as possible to the position they would have occupied had cca not violated the agreement.the settlement agreement required cca to provide a certain number of security personnel at icc for two years.cca failed to provide the required number of personnel during that period.by extending the settlement agreement for two years,the district court thus ordered the relief to which plaintiffs were originally entitled under the agreement but that cca had failed to provide.
we need not reach the question whether the fines would have been coercive and therefore civil,for the district court never actually imposed fines.the court merely informed cca of the fines that would have resulted had cca continued to violate the settlement agreement after the conclusion of the contempt proceedings.informing cca of the prospective fine schedule was not itself a sanction.hickey,cir holding a contempt order announcing a fine is not final for purposes of until the court imposes the fine.
we therefore conclude the court contempt finding is civil in nature.
extension of the settlement agreement 
cca contends the district court decision to extend the settlement agreement by two years was an abuse of discretion.we disagree.
the settlement agreement original terms,which were incorporated into the district court dismissal order,provided that the agreement would terminate on the two year anniversary of the date it was executed.the extension of the settlement agreement was therefore a modification of a court order.
courts have long had inherent power to modify court orders in changed circumstances.see united states swift.this power is now codified at rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.bellevue manor assocs.united states,cir.under well established law,substantial violation of a court order constitutes a significant change in factual circumstances.see.strategy,at thompson dep t of hous.urban,cir david leavitt,cir holland new jersey dep t of,cir vanguards of cleveland city of cleveland,cir.further,a modification of a court order is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance when it would return both parties as nearly as possible to where they would have been absent the changed circumstances.pigford veneman,emphasis omitted.here,the court extension of the settlement agreement returned plaintiffs to the position they would have occupied had cca not violated the agreement from its inception.the modification of the settlement agreement was therefore well within the court inherent power.
cca further contends the district court abused its discretion by extending the entire settlement agreement instead of extending only the staffing requirements embodied in paragraph.in particular,cca argues there is no evidence that it failed to comply with the settlement agreement other provisions,including requirements that cca investigate and prepare a report on all assaults,encourage good behavior by inmates,report aggravated batteries to the ada county sheriff office,and make housing assignments consistent with idoc standard operating procedure.
the district court findings were not confined to the failure of cca to fulfill the staffing requirements.the court found,in addition,that the same supervisors who signed falsified record sheets remain ed on the job,and that cca shoddy record keeping obscured who was working at what posts and at what times.in light of these findings,the district court doubted cca compliance in other respects,such as whether every violent incident is reported.further,the district court was reasonably concerned that cca failure to comply with staffing requirements affected its ability to comply with the settlement agreement other requirements.the court conclusion that the extension of the entire agreement was suitably tailored to correct cca was thus not an abuse of discretion.
for the same reason,we reject cca contention that extending the entire settlement agreement violates a a limitations on prospective relief.plaintiffs brought this case under for alleged violations of their eighth amendment rights.when the district court and the parties approved the settlement agreement,there was no dispute that its remedies were narrowly drawn,necessary,and the least intrusive means to bring icc into compliance with the eighth amendment,in accordance with a a.the same remedies remain narrowly drawn,necessary,and the least intrusive means to rectify cca continued eighth amendment violations.
attorney fees 
the district court awarded plaintiffs attorney fees and costs associated with the contempt proceedings.cca contends the attorney fees award violates the plra.we disagree.
attorney fees in prisoner civil rights cases 
the plra was enacted to deter frivolous prisoner lawsuits that needlessly wasted judicial resources.woods carey,cir.congress sought to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits.porter nussle,d.toward this end,congress introduced a variety of reforms designed to filter out the bad prisoner claims and facilitate consideration of the good.jones bock,d.among the reforms were changes to the manner in which attorney fees are determined in prisoner civil rights cases.
the plra provisions relating to attorney fees apply to any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail,prison,or other correctional facility,in which attorney fees are authorized under.d.section is an exception to the american rule that each party ordinarily bears its own attorney fees.hensley eckerhart,d.section authorizes courts to award a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs to a prevailing party in cases brought under various civil rights statutes,including.b.section is asymmetrical,awarding attorney fees to civil rights plaintiffs if they are prevailing parties,but awarding attorney fees to prevailing civil rights defendants only if plaintiffs claims are frivolous.see hughes rowe,d.the purpose of is to ensure that federal rights are adequately enforced.perdue kenny ex rel.winn,d.thus,a reasonable attorney fee is one that is sufficient to induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meritorious civil rights case.id.at.
federal courts employ the lodestar method to determine a reasonable attorney fees award under.the lodestar method is a process.fischer sjb,cir.first,a court calculates the lodestar figure by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on a case by a reasonable hourly rate.id.a reasonable hourly rate is ordinarily the prevailing market rate in the relevant community.perdue,at citation omitted.the lodestar figure roughly approximates the fee that the prevailing attorney would have received if he or she had been representing a paying client who was billed by the hour in a comparable case,id.emphasis omitted,and is therefore a presumptively reasonable fee.gonzalez city of maywood,cir.second,the court determines whether to modify the lodestar figure,upward or downward,based on factors not subsumed in the lodestar figure.see perdue,at morales city of san rafael,cir,as amended on denial of reh g,cir.
the plra alters the lodestar method in prisoner civil rights cases in three fundamental ways.first,rather than hours reasonably expended in the litigation,hours used to determine the fee award are limited to those that are directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff rights and either proportionately related to relief or directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing such relief.d.second,in actions resulting in monetary judgments,the total amount of the attorney fees award associated with the monetary judgment is limited to percent of the judgment.id.d see jimenez franklin,cir.this limitation does not apply to actions or parts of actions resulting in relief.third,the hourly rate used as the basis for a fee award is limited to percent of the hourly rate used for paying appointed counsel under the criminal justice act,the cja rate.d.hereafter,we refer to percent of the cja rate as the plra rate.notably,the plra is silent as to the second step of the lodestar method,in which a court may adjust the lodestar figure based on factors not subsumed in that figure.
the fee enhancements under the plra 
the district court concluded plaintiffs were entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs because they were prevailing part ies in a case brought under.see.the court used the lodestar method,as modified and limited by the plra,to determine reasonable attorney fees.the court first multiplied the number of hours directly and reasonably expended in enforcing the settlement agreement by the plra rate to arrive at the lodestar figure.the court then enhanced the lodestar figure based on factors not already subsumed in that figure.
cca contends the attorney fees award violates the plra.according to cca,in a suit for injunctive or declaratory relief,the plra prohibits an attorney fees award exceeding the amount determined by multiplying the number of hours permitted under d by the plra rate specified in d.that is,cca contends the plra forbids a court from enhancing the lodestar figure,even if the enhancement is based on factors not subsumed in that figure.we disagree and conclude the plra allows enhancement of the lodestar figure in appropriate circumstances.our conclusion follows from two principles of statutory interpretation.
first,a party contending that legislative action changed settled law has the burden of showing that the legislature intended such a change.green bock laundry mach,d.when congress enacted the plra,the lodestar method for determining a reasonable attorney fees award under had already achieved dominance in the federal courts.gisbrecht barnhart,d.as explained above,the lodestar method is a process.a court first determines the lodestar figure by multiplying the hours reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate it then determines whether to adjust that figure upward or downward.see,blum stenson,d addressing hourly rates id.at addressing enhancements hensley,at addressing hourly rates id.at addressing enhancements.there is nothing in the attorney fees provisions of the plra that instructs a court not to take both steps in this process.
a comparison to the attorney fees provision of the individuals with disabilities in education act idea is instructive.the idea specifies that attorney fees awarded under that statute shall be based on rates prevailing in the community.i c.the next sentence,in language not found in the plra,then specifies no bonus or multiplier may be used in calculating the fees awarded under this subsection.id.as this sentence illustrates,congress knows how to instruct a court not to adjust the lodestar figure.yet such instruction is conspicuously absent from the plra.congress silence is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed.jones,at.that is,congress silence is strong evidence that the plra contemplates the continuation of the normal practice under of adjusting the lodestar figure by factors not subsumed in that figure.
second,when congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another let alone in the very next provision federal courts presume that congress intended a difference in meaning.loughrin united states,d citation omitted.in cases involving monetary judgments,the plra expressly limits the total amount of the attorney fees award associated with the monetary judgment to percent of the judgment.d see jimenez,at.by contrast,d,addressed to attorney fees awards not associated with monetary judgments,does not express a limitation on the total amount of those awards.instead,it limits only the hourly rate that an award may be based on.d.we infer from the presence of an express limitation on the total amount of
