appellants flir systems,flir and indigo systems corporation indigo appeal from a judgment and order awarding respondents william parrish and timothy fitzgibbons attorney fees and costs in a trade secret action,et the trial court found that the action was filed and maintained in bad faith within the meaning of section of the california uniform trade secrets act.we affirm.
indigo manufactures and sells microbolometers.a microbolometer is a device used in connection with infrared cameras,night vision,and thermal imaging.a significant portion of indigo technology was created by respondent william parrish.flir manufactures and sells infrared cameras,night vision,and thermal imaging systems that use microbolometers.in,flir purchased indigo for approximately million,acquiring indigo patents,technology,and intellectual property.parish and fitzgibbons were shareholders and officers of indigo before the company was sold.after the sale,they continued working at indigo.
in,respondents decided to start a new company to mass produce bolometers and gave notice that they would quit indigo on or about january.the new company was based on a business plan thermicon developed by fitzgibbons in and when he was.
before leaving indigo,respondents discussed allowing appellants to participate in thermicon.respondents proposed outsourcing bolometer production to a third party.the production startup time would be quick,assuming respondents could acquire technology licenses and intellectual property from a third party.respondents offered flir a interest in thermicon.flir rejected the offer and wished respondents success in the new endeavor.
in early,respondents entered into negotiations with raytheon company to acquire licensing,technology,and manufacturing facilities for thermicon.respondents assured appellants they would not misappropriate indigo trade secrets and that the new company would use an intellectual property filter similar to the one used at indigo to prevent the misuse of trade secrets.
fearful that the new business would undermine flir market,appellants sued for injunctive relief and damages on june.the action was premised on the theory that respondents could not mass produce microbolometers based on the thermicon time line without misappropriating trade secrets.
upon learning of the lawsuit,raytheon company terminated business discussions with respondents.on august,respondents advised appellants that they were not going forward with the new business.
the permanent injunction trial 
appellants dismissed the damage causes of action and proceeded to trial for a permanent injunction to enjoin respondents from making use of appellants trade secrets in the design,manufacture,and production of uncooled vanadium oxide microbolometers selling uncooled vanadium oxide microbolometers in commercial markets less than months after respondents entered into a license with raytheon company or any other third party to purchase intellectual property or using,disclosing or misappropriating the contents of an indigo commodity code database that parrish attempted to download while an employee at indigo.
after eight days of testimony,the trial court found no misappropriation or threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.it was uncontroverted that respondents received no funding for thermicon,did not start a new business,had no employees or customers,did not lease a facility or develop technology,and did not design,produce,sell,or offer to sell infrared products.
in a statement of decision,the trial court found that the action was brought in bad faith based on a theory of inevitable disclosure,a doctrine not recognized by california courts because it contravenes a strong public policy of employee mobility that permits to start new entrepreneurial endeavors.see continental moseley cal d,whyte schlage lock th,d.appellants were ordered to pay attorney fees and costs.
section fees trial rules,and appellate rules 
section of the california uniform trade secrets act provides if a claim of misappropriation is made in bad faith,the trial court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party.although the legislature has not defined bad faith,our courts have developed a standard objective speciousness of the claim,and subjective bad faith in bringing or maintaining the action,for an improper purpose.gemini aluminum california custom shapes,th,d gemini.section authorizes the trial court to award attorney fees as a deterrent to specious trade secret claims,at,d.because the award is a sanction,a trial court has broad discretion in awarding fees,at,d.
on appeal from such an order,the appellant has an uphill battle and must overcome both the sufficiency of evidence rule and the abuse of discretion rule.we need not repeat these rules.see estate of gilkison th,d.as we shall explain,appellant does not appear to appreciate the trial court power and its discretionary power to award attorney fees and costs to curtail a bad faith claim of trade secret misappropriation.we do not retry cases on appeal and we do not substitute our discretion for that of the trial court.
objectively specious 
appellant argues that the first prong,objective speciousness,was not satisfied.objective speciousness exists where the action superficially appears to have merit but there is a complete lack of evidence to support the claim.gemini,supra,th at,d crst van expedited,werner enterprises cir.
the trial court found that the action was objectively specious because appellants suffered no economic harm and there was no misappropriation or threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.it also found that respondents did not misappropriate the idea of outsourcing bolometer production to a third party and that the thermicon business plan,which included a business forecast chart,did not misappropriate confidential information from appellants.
objective speciousness was established by evidence that appellants had an anticompetitive motive in filing the lawsuit.when asked why the action was filed,flir ceo earl lewis testified that we ca tolerate a direct competitive threat by bill parrish and tim fitzgibbons.lewis had no evidence of wrongdoing but was bothered that respondents planned to compete with flir in the future.
appellants argue that attorney fees may not be awarded unless the action is frivolous,an objective standard used to impose code of civil procedure section sanctions.but the word frivolous does not appear in section.s ection requires objective speciousness of the plaintiff claim,as opposed to frivolousness gemini,supra,th at,d.
the evidence here supports the finding that appellants filed a specious action as a preemptive strike and for an anticompetitive purpose.the complaint alleges that appellants suffered actual damages and that respondents willfully and maliciously converted appellants trade secrets with the deliberate intent to injure appellants business the evidence,however,showed no actual damages,misappropriation,or threatened misappropriation of trade secrets,and no threat of imminent harm.
the trial court ruled that the action was based on the doctrine of inevitable disclosure and violated public policy favoring employee mobility.bus.metro traffic control,shadow traffic network th,d bayer roche molecular systems,d.the doctrine of inevitable disclosure is not the law in california.whyte schlage lock,supra,th at,d inevitable disclosure injunction not permitted.sixty years ago our supreme court in continental moseley,supra,cal d at page,stated a former employee has the right to engage in a competitive business for himself and to enter into competition with his former employer,even for the business of those who had formerly been the customers of his former employer,provided such competition is fairly and legally conducted.citation.
appellants admitted that respondents had the right leave to indigo but claimed that respondents would misappropriate trade secrets if they started a new company.but speculation that a departing employee may misappropriate and use a trade secret in a startup business will not support an injunction.continental moseley,supra,cal d at,injunction may not issue based on employer speculation globespan,d,same.a trade secrets plaintiff must show an actual use or an actual threat.bayer roche molecular systems,supra,d at.
missing here is evidence of misappropriation,threatened misappropriation,imminent harm,or ongoing wrongdoing.william sundermeier,president of a flir division,voted with flir ceo lewis to file the lawsuit but had no personal knowledge that respondents had committed a wrongful act.at trial,sundermeier could not say why the lawsuit was still a year and a half later.
subjective bad faith 
subjective bad faith may be inferred by evidence that appellants intended to cause unnecessary delay,filed the action to harass respondents,or harbored an improper motive.gemini,supra,th at,d.the timing of the action may raise an inference of bad faith,at,d.similar inferences may be made where the plaintiff proceeds to trial after the action fatal shortcomings are revealed by opposing counsel,at,d.
appellants suspected that trade secrets would be misappropriated and claim that a reasonable suspicion is evidence of good faith the trial court did not credit this theory,instead finding that appellants reasons for bringing and maintaining the action were inevitable disclosure arguments.in reviewing the facts which led the trial court to impose sanctions,we must accept the version thereof which supports the trial court determination,and must indulge in the inferences which favor its findings.citations.citation.gemini,supra,th at,d.
hard drive download 
appellants contend there was a threatened misappropriation of trade secrets because parrish downloaded technological data onto a portable hard drive before leaving indigo.the information was stored on indigo computer network in a commodity code database for employee access.
working on a project at indigo,parrish was frustrated about the slow computer network and copied the database to work at home.parrish tried to use the hard drive but discovered that the database hyperlinks were broken and the data was not readable.parrish left the hard drive at home and destroyed it in the spring of before the lawsuit was filed.
parrish told jim woolaway,flir chief intellectual property officer,about the download several months after the lawsuit was filed.woolaway reported the incident to his superiors.thomas surran,an indigo executive,thereafter attempted to download the database on a hard drive and confirmed the hyperlinks did not work.
the hard drive download was not a consideration in bringing the action because appellants first learned of it after the complaint was filed.the trial court found that the download was not a threatened misappropriation because there was no evidence that the contents of the hard drive,if such contents existed,were improperly accessed,used,or copied before the drive was destroyed.
appellants claim that the hard drive download is a threatened misappropriation under the california uniform trade secrets act.this is a restatement of the inevitable disclosure doctrine which is not the law in california.whyte schlage lock,supra,th at,d trade secrets practice in california ed.the trial court,in construing section,properly found that a threatened misappropriation means a threat by a defendant to misuse trade secrets,manifested by words or conduct,where the evidence indicates imminent misuse.see,central valley general hosp.smith th,d imminent threat of misuse based on defendant possession of trade secrets and prior misuse.
under appellants construction of the law,an employer could bring a trade secret action after an employee downloads a company document and deletes the document from his or her laptop computer at home.a similar action could be brought where company messages are left on the employee or phone answering machine and deleted after the employee changes jobs.
the california uniform trade secrets act requires an a ctual or threatened misappropriation,subd.a.mere possession of trade secrets by a departing employee is not enough for an injunction.central valley general hosp.smith,supra,th at,d trade secrets practice in california,supra.a trade secret will not be protected by the extraordinary remedy of an injunction on mere suspicion or apprehension of injury.there must be a substantial threat of impending injury before an injunction will issue citations.del monte fresh produce dole food,d,discussing california and florida law.
where the trade secrets plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction,section,subdivision c authorizes only injunctions that compel affirmative acts.it authorizes mandatory,not prohibitory injunctions,mandatory injunctions requiring that a misappropriator return the fruits of misappropriation to an aggrieved person citation.an order enjoining a remote threat or misuse or disclosure is prohibitory and does not necessarily compel affirmative acts.thus such an injunction is not authorized by subdivision c of section.central valley general hospital smith,supra,th at,d see trade secrets practice in,supra.
although the complaint was for a permanent injunction,appellants did not seek an order compelling respondents to return anything.the hard drive was destroyed prior to trial.respondents could not return anything because no trade secrets were misappropriated.all that is alleged,at bottom,is that defendants could misuse plaintiff secrets,and plaintiffs fear they will.that is not enough.teradyne,clear communications.
subjective bad faith was established by the contradictory testimony of appellants executives who did not want to take responsibility for initiating and maintaining the action.appellants managers and employees testified that respondents were trustworthy,would not do anything wrong,and should have been allowed to start a new company.
patent applications 
appellants argue that parrish objections to two indigo patent applications created a reasonable suspicion that he would misappropriate trade secrets.parrish held patents and was the inventor of or patents while employed at indigo.
after quitting indigo,parrish learned that appellants were submitting patent applications on a packaging and manufacturing process that he had worked on.parrish told woolaway,flir chief intellectual property officer,that the patent applications were not valid.at trial,appellants claimed that parrish objection to the patent applications caused them to believe that trade secrets might be misappropriated.
woolaway,who authored the patent applications,stated that the united states patent trademark office could go either way on the validity of the applications.woolaway was concerned about parrish remarks but did not believe parish would steal or misuse appellants intellectual property.this testimony was echoed by appellants officers and managers who stated that respondents were trustworthy and that an inventor disagreement about a patent application did not signal a plot to steal trade secrets.the trial court reasonably concluded that parrish objections to the patent applications was not a threatened misappropriation of a trade secret.
trade secret experts 
the trial court factually found that appellants maintained the action in bad faith with expert testimony that lacked a scientific basis and failed to address the possibility that respondents could lawfully acquire technology from raytheon company.appellants claimed that respondents plan to work with raytheon company was a contrivance and that raytheon did not have the technology for microbolometers.the trial court found that respondents testimony,the testimony of a raytheon official,and the raytheon negotiation documents were credible and unrebutted.it concluded that the contrivance argument was asserted in bad faith to bolster a groundless action.
subjective bad faith was also established by appellants failure to identify what trade secrets would be subject to the permanent injunction.appellants experts testified that appellants had a mix of trade secrets and information and that no list was prepared to identify the trade secrets.the trial court found that the proposed injunction was overbroad,did not give notice as to what was forbidden,and would harm respondents reputation in the business commu
