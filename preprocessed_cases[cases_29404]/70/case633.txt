the following facts are undisputed on the summary judgment motion in august gemmy began development of inflatable outdoor decorative figures,through its design and production facility in china.in october certain prototype inflatable halloween and christmas figures were exhibited at hong kong to potential customers.the prototypes were inflated by a hair dryer through a long tube,whereas the patent claims require that the assembly has a fan in the base for inflation of the figure.the prototype inflatables were seen at that time by approximately thirty retailers,and there were quote sheets that included an estimated price for the product,measurements,and sometimes weights,as found by the district court.the district court found that no sales orders were taken at the time of the hong kong display.the district court stated,and it appears to be undisputed,that the first commercial shipments were made in may.
in january gemmy president,dan flaherty,visited the factory in hong kong.he observed that the hair dryer had been replaced with a box fan.the record before us contains no other evidence concerning this aspect of the invention,and chrisha states that gemmy resisted discovery of engineering drawings and sales records.various discovery disputes and sanctions were not resolved in connection with the summary judgment.
the record states that gemmy and chrisha retained the same independent sales representative,quay richerson.in chrisha commissioned the chinese companies,shanghai toy art and great success toys,to create and produce inflatable decorative figures.gemmy states that chrisha learned of and imitated gemmy products,implicating quay richerson.on october,after the patent was allowed but before it issued,gemmy filed suit in the united states district court for the district of kansas against chrisha and richerson for trade secret violation,copyright infringement,and other commercial torts.with its amended complaints and requests for preliminary injunction,gemmy filed the following statement of its president dan flaherty,made by affidavit dated november,
