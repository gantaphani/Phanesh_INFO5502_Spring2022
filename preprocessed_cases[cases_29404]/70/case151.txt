robert harris appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york sharpe,dated june,dismissing debtor appeal from orders of the bankruptcy court for the northern district of new york littlefield,dated july,and october,for failure to include in the designation of record on appeal the transcript of a june,bankruptcy hearing as required by federal rules of bankruptcy procedure rule and rule.harris also appeals the district court denial of his motion for reconsideration of the june,dismissal order.we hold that the district court abused its discretion under rule when it dismissed debtor case for failure to include the june transcript in the designation of record without first giving debtor notice and opportunity to respond and without determining whether a lesser sanction would have been appropriate.the judgment of the district court is vacated,and the case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
background 
debtor owned commercial rental properties at state street state street and south main avenue south main collectively,the properties in albany,new york.because harris fell behind in his property tax payments on the properties in the,the county of albany the county brought a tax foreclosure action against him in in county court and obtained final judgment in its favor on december.the county soon thereafter executed and recorded the deeds to the properties.harris appealed the foreclosure judgment and,on april,the albany county court amended its december judgment nunc pro tunc to indicate that the deeds conveyed to the county full and complete title to both properties.
on january,harris filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition pursuant to chapter of the united states bankruptcy code,in which he included his ownership interests in state street and south main.upon the filing of this petition,harris obtained an automatic stay of all federal and state proceedings against the bankruptcy estate,including the properties.see a.a trustee for the estate,mark swimelar,was then appointed.
the county responded to the bankruptcy petition by moving to lift the stay on the two foreclosed properties.on september,the bankruptcy court granted the county motion,concluding that the two properties were not part of the bankruptcy estate and hence not subject to the automatic stay.harris then appealed the decision of the bankruptcy court to the district court for the northern district of new york hurd,on the grounds that because the foreclosure action was a preferential or fraudulent transfer under and,the bankruptcy court erred in lifting the stay concerning both properties.in a november,decision,judge hurd reversed the lower court decision,holding that it had erred by not considering whether the foreclosure action was a preferential or fraudulent transfer under and and entered a stay pending the lower court decision on the transfer issue.
on remand,the bankruptcy court held that harris had abandoned his claim because he had not addressed it in his brief and that,in any event,it was meritless because,under chapter,a secured creditor like the county would have received percent of its claim.
the bankruptcy court then considered harris claim that the tax foreclosure was fraudulent because harris received less than the reasonably equivalent value for the properties under,which states in pertinent part that 
t he trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property incurred by the debtor,that was made or incurred on or within years before the date of the filing of the petition,if the debtor voluntarily or involuntarily received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation and was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made.
a b.the county argued that a tax foreclosure action should be considered a reasonably equivalent value under the statute because of the supreme court decision in bfp resolution trust,d,which held that the reasonably equivalent value of a foreclosed property is the price received at the foreclosure auction so long as the state foreclosure requirements are met.id.at.harris,on the other hand,maintained that a tax foreclosure without a public sale could not be considered similar to the foreclosure auction at issue in bfp,and that the transfer was fraudulent because he had received less than the reasonably equivalent value of the properties.
in its march,decision,the bankruptcy court agreed with harris view of,noting that bfp did not extend to strict tax foreclosure proceedings like harris where property is transferred with little judicial oversight and without competitive bidding and a public sale.indeed,the amount of a property owner tax debt,the court noted,bears no relationship to the value of the property confiscated without public sale.the court observed,however,that based on the property values as stated in debtor bankruptcy petition,the taxes exceeded the debtor schedule a value of south main street by over and of state street by almost.the court gave both harris and the county the opportunity to file documents that would prove amounts or values other than those stated in record.
while harris did file appraisals of the properties pursuant to the bankruptcy court order,it does not appear that the county ever filed any documentation regarding the claim despite having obtained an extension of time from the bankruptcy court to do so.in subsequent submissions,the county ignored the issues and instead objected to harris proposed reorganization plan,required under the bankruptcy statutes for providing payments to creditors.the county asserted that harris had not submitted all of the schedules for his expenses and that the proposed the seventh one he had not feasible because,inter alia,it listed no living expenses other than per month for food and failed to include the payment of property taxes.
on may,the united states trustee moved to dismiss the voluntary bankruptcy petition pursuant to c on the grounds that harris had failed to make timely payments on his reorganization plan and that his unreasonable delay was prejudicial to creditors.section c provides in pertinent part that on request of a party in interest or the united states trustee and after notice and a hearing,the court may dismiss a case under this chapter for cause,including unreasonable delay by the debtor that is prejudicial to creditors.c.
on june,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the trustee motion to dismiss.present at the hearing were the county,the trustee,harris and counsel for several of harris other creditors.at the beginning of the hearing,the bankruptcy court inquired into whether harris was current with his tax filings,as it had asked at the last hearing.harris responded that the tax filings were not complete.the court noted that these failures betrayed a lack of seriousness on harris part to carry out his duties under the bankruptcy laws and merely evinced his intent to delay.
harris objected to the court characterization of the proceedings on the ground that the first issue to be decided was ownership of the properties and that after that issue was decided,he could take care of the rest of the administration of the estate.the bankruptcy court rejected this argument and explained 
i will grant the trustee motion and note for the record the delay,the failure to pay ongoing taxes,the failure to file tax returns all of this to me says delay and trying to drag this case out.if you were serious about doing this,then you would have satisfied your duties as a debtor in this court 
while counsel for creditor upstate coin laundry was present and sought to confirm the reorganization plan proposed by harris because it would provide for the payment of the taxes on our property,the court did not inquire what prejudice they would suffer from,nor whether they opposed,the motion to dismiss.harris other creditors were not at the hearing and also do not appear to have been asked whether they objected to the dismissal or would suffer prejudice therefrom.
after the hearing,on july,the bankruptcy court then dismissed harris chapter petition without prejudice.the order indicated that all parties had been present,that harris had acknowledged his failure to file all federal and state income tax returns and to pay all real property taxes and that the delay was prejudicial to creditors.the bankruptcy court subsequently rejected harris motion to reconsider after a hearing on the issue.
as the foregoing makes clear,the court never decided the transfer issue.at some point during the pendency of this case in the lower courts,the county auctioned off state for and south main for,the proceeds from which are now in an escrow account.
harris appealed both the dismissal of his chapter case and the denial of his motion to reconsider to the district court,but did not include a transcript of the proceedings below.in a june,order,the district court explained that,without the june transcript of the proceedings before the bankruptcy court as required under bankruptcy rule,it could not determine whether that court findings of fact were clearly erroneous.moreover,it could not conclude whether the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider without a transcript of that specific hearing as well.accordingly,the district court dismissed the appeal under rule without considering the merits 
in dicta,however,the district court noted that the dismissal order appeared sufficient on its face because the order indicated that harris had acknowledged his failure to file tax returns or pay property taxes and that the finding of prejudice to creditors from the resulting delay was not clearly erroneous.the court also noted that the exhibits in the record before the bankruptcy court demonstrated that harris had not paid property taxes or filed his tax returns.
harris sought reconsideration of the district court dismissal of his appeal,but missed the filing deadline by one day.harris made no request to extend the deadline and did not provide any facts or argument that would justify accepting his late filing based on excusable neglect under bankruptcy rule b.accordingly,on february,the district court denied his motion for reconsideration.
harris timely appeals from the dismissal of his appeal and the denial of his motion for reconsideration.
discussion 
we review a district court dismissal of a bankruptcy appeal on procedural grounds for abuse of discretion.see in re lynch,cir per curiam see also in re tampa chain,cir per curiam holding that the district court decision to dismiss will be affirmed unless it has abused its discretion.a district court abuses its discretion when it applies legal standards incorrectly or relies upon clearly erroneous findings of fact,or proceed s on the basis of an erroneous view of the applicable law,verio,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted alteration in original 
requirements under bankruptcy rule 
before reaching the question of what standard the district court should have applied in dismissing harris appeal,we must first address harris argument that he had not violated any procedural rule such that the district court could have sanctioned him at all,let alone dismissed his appeal.indeed,in his reply brief,harris asserts that the district court erred in dismissing the appeal because the transcript from the june hearing was not necessary to the appeal and contained only oral argument,not any testimony.
bankruptcy rule governs what documents are required to perfect an appeal.it states that in pertinent part,
the appellant shall file with the clerk and serve on the appellee a designation of the items to be included in the record on appeal the record on appeal shall include the items so designated by the parties,the notice of appeal,the judgment,order,or decree appealed from,and any opinion,findings of fact,and conclusions of law of the court if the record designated by any party includes a transcript of any proceeding or a part thereof,the party shall,immediately after filing the designation,deliver to the reporter and file with the clerk a written request for the transcript and make satisfactory arrangements for payment of its cost.
fed.while the rule does not expressly mandate that the record on appeal include all transcripts of the proceedings below,its provisions make clear that those documents which include findings of fact or conclusions of law of the court are deemed part of the record,including any transcripts,for which the rule makes express cost provisions.
while harris is correct that the june hearing contained oral argument,not testimony,by the parties,it also contained the bankruptcy judge findings of fact and the evidence on which he made his conclusions,namely harris admissions that he was behind in filing his tax returns for,that he had not paid his taxes and that he had access to funds from which he could pay those amounts.moreover,the order from the bankruptcy court dismissing the case specifically mentioned the june hearing.accordingly,without a transcript of the proceedings,the district court did not have a complete record to review the bankruptcy court findings.because harris violated rule,we must now examine whether the district court judge properly dismissed the appeal because of that violation.
standard of review under rule 
rule,provides,inter alia,that a n appellant failure to take any step including those outlined in rule other than timely filing a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal,but is ground only for such action as the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel deems appropriate,which may include dismissal of the appeal.fed.a the rule makes clear that a district court enjoys discretion to dismiss an appeal in all cases except where the debtor does not file a timely notice of appeal,in which case the court has no choice but to dismiss the case.
we recently addressed the standard for rule dismissals in in re lynch,at.in that case,the district court dismissed an appeal as untimely because the debtor had not filed the record and designation of issues on appeal pursuant to rule in a timely manner,even after having received a valid extension.we noted that b y its terms,rule does not set standards for when dismissal is appropriate and that,as a result,some circuits had established conditions to constrain a district court discretion to dismiss a case for failure to abide by a procedural rule.id.we nevertheless declined to adopt any definitive standard in lynch,however,because we found that the petitioner failure to file a timely record and designation on appeal was governed by the excusable neglect standard of federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b rule,which governs the enlargement of time for deadlines in bankruptcy proceedings see id.we,thus,left open the possibility that dismissal would be an unwarranted sanction for some errors,and hence,impermissible under rule a.see also in re tampa chain,at holding that,in considering dismissal of an appeal,the court should exercise discretion to determine whether dismissal is appropriate in the circumstances presented by the case.
while we have declined to determine what considerations should govern a district court dismissal under rule,several of our sister courts have undertaken such an analysis.the fourth circuit has cabined district courts discretion to dismiss appeals under rule.in resolution trust spr in re spr,cir,a panel of the fourth circuit,which included justice powell retired,held that for late,filings in bankruptcy court,a district court before dismissing an appeal under rule must consider whether to 
make a finding of bad faith or negligence give the appellant notice or an opportunity to explain the delay consider whether the delay had any possible prejudicial effect on the other parties or indicate that it considered the impact of the sanction and available alternatives.
id.at.the ninth circuit has also held that in the rule context,a district court should consider a party bad faith and the availability of alternative sanctions except in the most egregious of circumstances before dismissing the appeal under rule.in re fitzsimmons,cir.outside of the specific rule context,other courts have likewise permitted bankruptcy appeals to continue despite a party
