on november,after a evidentiary hearing,and after considering the record in the case and fifteen briefs filed by the parties,united states district judge roslyn silver,of the united states district court for the district of arizona,handed down a order order imposing sanctions ultimately calculated in the sum of against attorney graeme hancock hancock,and jointly against attorney basil musnuff musnuff and the goodyear tire rubber company goodyear collectively the sanctionees.in the order,which included pages of findings of fact and seventeen pages of legal analysis,judge silver found that there is clear and convincing evidence that sanctions are required to be imposed against hancock,musnuff,and goodyear.the court is aware of the unfortunate professional consequences that may flow from this order.those consequences,however,are a direct result of repeated,deliberate decisions by hancock,musnuff,and goodyear to delay the production of relevant information,make misleading and false statements,and conceal relevant documents.hancock,musnuff,and goodyear will surely be disappointed,but they can not be surprised.
because the fraud and deceit practiced on the district court and the plaintiffs by the sanctionees was not discovered until after the underlying litigation had been closed and plaintiffs had settled with goodyear based upon the incomplete information provided by the sanctionees,the district court imposed the sanctions in reliance upon its inherent power,and not under federal rule of civil procedure,or.
the sanctionees appeal from the judgment awarding the sanctions,arguing that the district court abused its discretion in relying upon its inherent power to impose sanctions,and in determining the amount and the nature of the sanctions imposed.
we affirm both the district court monetary and sanctions imposed against the sanctionees.
factual and procedural background 
in june,leroy and donna haeger,and barry and suzanne haeger collectively the haegers,or plaintiffs were all seriously injured when one of the goodyear tires on the front of their motor home failed while they were driving on a highway,which caused their vehicle to swerve off the road and overturn.the haegers retained attorney david kurtz kurtz,who filed suit against goodyear in in arizona state court.the case was quickly removed to federal court by goodyear.goodyear was represented by musnuff,who served as goodyear national coordinating counsel on all cases,and hancock,who served as goodyear local counsel in arizona.musnuff and goodyear counsel,deborah okey okey,were responsible for reviewing and approving all discovery responses in the case.
before releasing its tire,goodyear performed department of transportation dot tests,electronic high speed test data high speed tests,heat rise test results heat rise tests,dot endurance tests,crown durability tests,and bead durability tests on the tire.throughout discovery,the haegers repeatedly sought the results of goodyear tests on the tire.however,as detailed below,goodyear,musnuff,and hancock failed to search for,withheld these relevant and responsive testing documents in violation of their discovery obligations to produce requested relevant documents,and to supplement prior disclosures.see fed.civ.pro.
goodyear served its initial disclosure statement on the plaintiffs on december,pursuant to rule.the initial disclosures did not include testing information,and kurtz promptly requested that goodyear produce t esting documentation regarding the tires.nevertheless,goodyear did not supplement the disclosures in its initial disclosure statement.goodyear propounded interrogatories asking for,among other things,each legal theory under which you believe goodyear is liable.in response,on august,the haegers articulated their theory of the case prolonged heat causes degradation of the tire which,under appropriate circumstances,can lead to tire failure and tread separation even when the tire is properly inflated.additionally,the haegers stated that when the tire was used on motor homes,the tire produced a level of heat and degradation which the tire was not designed to endure,leading to its premature failure.
the haegers served their first request for production of documents first request,pursuant to rule,in september.request for production number requested a ll test records for the tires,including,but no t limited to,road tests,wheel tests,high speed testing,and durability testing.goodyear objected to this request with a series of boilerplate objections,and failed to produce any documents.however,on november,in its supplemental response to request for production number,goodyear agreed to produce the dot tests for the tire.on december,kurtz sent hancock a letter clarifying what had been requested 
request for production.we asked for test records for the,including road tests,wheel tests,high speed testing,and durability testing.you objected,suggesting the test records were overly broad and unduly burdensome.you have only produced the dot test data showing the tires were tested at mph.my interest is in finding the rest of the test data.if there is any,it is your obligation to disclose it.
on january,hancock wrote an email to musnuff regarding request for production number,stating 
we should either respond to any portions of kurtz letter or figure out that we have a fight on our hands on these points and prepare a counter argument rtp.t est records for all testing on this size tire.again,was the only testing at mph or less what speed testing did goodyear rely on we supplement since his theory is that this tire ca operate at mph in the southwest for long periods 
on january,the haegers expert witness,david osborne osborne,identified speed as a contributing factor in the tire failure in his expert report.in response to osborne report,musnuff wrote to hancock 
osborne appears to draw the conclusion that the subject tire was only tested at speeds up to mph from the fact that the only test data we produced is the dot test data.of course,our discovery response was limited to dot test data because plaintiff had not yet identified their defect theory at that time.now that plaintiffs are pinpointing speed as an issue,perhaps we need to supplement our discovery responses to show the testing of this tire at various speeds.thoughts 
musnuff also forwarded this email to goodyear counsel,okey,concluding we should consider supplementing our discovery responses to show the testing of this tire at various higher speeds.despite goodyear understanding of its obligation to supplement its previous discovery responses,they were not supplemented.
also in january,one of goodyear tire engineers located the tire high speed tests and heat rise tests.it is clear that the engineer delivered at least the high speed tests to musnuff because on february,musnuff emailed the high speed tests to hancock.neither musnuff nor hancock produced these tests to the haegers.instead,on april,when judge silver asked hancock is there any internal documentation that is available that has been requested that your clients have not provided,hancock responded that goodyear had responded to all outstanding discovery if a document shows up,we of course produce it and supplement our answers.this response to judge silver was false.at the time of this statement,hancock had been sent the high speed tests and had stated to musnuff that they should be produced promptly given the accusation of no high speed testing in the january report that put that at issue in the case it was thus a false representation to state that goodyear had responded to all outstanding discovery.
additionally,as a follow up to his receipt of the high speed tests,musnuff emailed goodyear tire engineer requesting additional data,explaining if we disclose any of the high speed testing which is in our best interest then we need to produce all of it.despite the fact that these high speed testing documents were responsive to the haegers discovery request,musnuff was still undecided about whether they were going to be produced.
on may,the haegers served a third request for production of documents third request requesting tests related to whether the tire was suitable for use at a speed of mph.at a discovery dispute hearing on may,hancock admitted that there were tests available showing that the tire was tested for speeds above mph,but did not mention that goodyear had been withholding these tests from the haegers for approximately four months.instead,hancock represented that goodyear would now produce these tests because of the new obligation arising from the haegers third request.this was a misrepresentation to the court as hancock had known that these high speed tests were responsive to the first request since february.
on may,goodyear deposed osborne,the haegers expert witness.osborne was deposed while under the impression that no high speed testing of the tire had been done.neither hancock nor musnuff disclosed that goodyear was withholding the high speed tests.the district court found that taking osborne deposition knowing that osborne was operating under incorrect assumptions and an incomplete record,could only have been done to delay production of the tests in hopes of gaining a tactical advantage.
goodyear finally produced the high speed tests on june,again representing that the production was in response to the third request,when these tests were actually responsive to the first request.
on september,richard olsen olsen,goodyear rule b witness,testified during a deposition that while additional tests had been undertaken to determine if goodyear could justify a speed rating of the tire at mph,none of these additional tests was available.such tests were clearly in addition to the high speed tests that had been turned over to the haegers.shortly after olsen deposition,on october,hancock assured the court that there were no other tests in existence beyond those already produced to the haegers.despite the haegers demands for production,during discovery,goodyear disclosed only the dot tests and the high speed tests.
on april,the first day of trial,the haegers and goodyear informed the court that they had reached a settlement,and the court closed the case.based on the information derived from the results of at least one of the other cases discussed below,without having the relevant information in their possession due to the sanctionees deceit,the haegers apparently settled for a small fraction of what they might otherwise have done.
some time after the case had settled,kurtz saw an article stating that goodyear had produced internal heat and speed testing in a separate case involving the tire,and he realized that goodyear had withheld evidence it was required to produce during discovery.kurtz filed a motion for sanctions on may.the motion for sanctions argued that goodyear had engaged in discovery fraud by knowingly conceal ing crucial internal heat test records related to the defective design of the.goodyear opposition to the motion argued that it never represented that the dot test data comprised the totality of testing with regard to the tire.goodyear further argued 
nor did goodyear ever state or imply that it would produce all test records for the tires or identify all tests performed on the tires as sought in plaintiffs initial discovery requests.rather,goodyear objected to these requests and stated precisely which test records it agreed to produce,unambiguously indicating that it would not produce all test data.
this argument came as a surprise to the district court and it admitted that it was under the impression that goodyear had produced all test data relevant to plaintiffs claims.
on october,finding that there were serious questions regarding goodyear conduct in this case,the district court ordered goodyear to produce the test results at issue.goodyear produced the heat rise tests,but did not mention any additional tests.
on february,the district court issued a proposed order sanctioning goodyear based on goodyear failure to produce the heat rise tests and the repeated representations made by hancock to the district court that all responsive documents had been produced.the district court proposed order concluded that the heat rise tests should have been produced in response to the first request.in responding to this proposed order,goodyear,apparently by accident,disclosed the existence of additional tests the crown durability,bead durability,and dot endurance tests none of which had been mentioned or produced in the litigation.the court also discovered that olsen,goodyear rule b witness,knew about,but failed to mention,these additional tests at his deposition.the district court held that these tests should also have been produced as responsive to the haegers first request.
the district court held an evidentiary hearing on march,at which both musnuff and hancock testified that they had not knowingly engaged in discovery fraud.the district court found their testimonies to be untruthful and unreliable,and held that hancock,musnuff,and goodyear engaged in repeated and deliberate attempts to frustrate the resolution of this case on the merits.
in its order,the district court reviewed goodyear discovery responses in certain other tire failure actions collectively the other cases against goodyear in order to compare what the sanctionees knew,and when they knew it,with regards to the tests in woods goodyear,no.cv circuit court of hale county,alabama,in august,a goodyear employee informed musnuff that in addition to the high speed tests,the tests used to determine the suitability of the to be driven at mph included dot tests,heat rise tests,bead durability tests,crown durability tests,tests,tests,tests,and tests.in schalmo goodyear,ca ws.cir,pasco county,in april,musnuff and goodyear produced the heat rise tests in response to a request to produce tests associated with speed rating.musnuff wrote an email in may stating that the schalmo plaintiffs highlighted the heat rise testing taken during the durability testing of the.this case ended in a plaintiff verdict of million.finally,in bogaert goodyear,no.cv.of maricopa county,arizona,in response to an order from the court to produce testing of the tire suitability at mph,musnuff emailed hancock in june stating that the whole suitability testing package included the extended dot tests,the heat rise tests,the bead durability tests,and the crown durability tests.as in this case,in each of the other cases,goodyear engaged in lengthy discovery battles with the plaintiffs before it produced the requested documents.woods and bogaert were ultimately settled,but the amount of the settlements is either held under seal,or not reflected in the record of those cases.as stated above,presumably with the benefit of the heat rise tests,schalmo yielded a million verdict to the plaintiffs.
the district court considered each of the sanctionees conduct in the other cases in light of their conduct in the present case,and concluded that goodyear and its counsel took positions in other cases directly contrary to the positions they now ask this court to accept.the positions taken in these other cases,when goodyear and its counsel were not attempting to avoid sanctions,are reliable.
the district court concluded that sanctions under could not reach goodyear conduct,and that sanctions pursuant to rule were unavailable as they should be imposed before a case is closed.accordingly,relying upon its inherent power,the district court determined that the most appropriate sanction for remedying a course of misconduct would be to award plaintiffs all of the attorneys fees and costs they incurred after goodyear served its supplemental responses to plaintiffs first request.the district court held that the supplemental responses,in which goodyear only produced the dot tests,was the first definitive proof that goodyear was not going to cooperate in the litigation process.the court also noted that while it would be impossible to determine how the litigation would have proceeded if goodyear had made the proper disclosures,the case more likely than not would have settled much earlier,and,the haegers believe,for considerably more money.
the district court then conducted an exhaustive analysis time entries of its attorneys after goodyear served its supplemental responses to plaintiffs first request,and the extensive objections made by goodyear and its counsel to these time entries.the district court spent considerable time reviewing each time entry and its associated objections in an attempt to ensure the appropriate size of the award,and with painstaking attention to detail,made adjustments based on goodyear objections.ultimately,using the lodestar method,the district court found that the haegers should be reimbursed in attorneys fees and costs.the district court determined that hancock would be responsible for twenty percent of these fees and costs b ased on his relatively limited involvement,but in light of his repeated misstatements and his failure to correct the record once he learned his representations were false.musnuff and goodyear were held jointly responsible for the remaining eighty percent of the fees and costs.
the district court also ordered goodyear to file a copy of this order in any case initiated after the date of this order,with a footnote indicating that goodyear may apply to the court hearing the case to be excused from this requirement.the district court concluded that such filings were necessary based on goodyear history of engaging in discovery misconduct during every case that had been brought to the court attention.the court reasoned that by filing the order in future cases,goodyear would alert plaintiffs and the courts that it has not acted in good faith in the past when litigating such cases,and give notice of the tests goodyear had attempted to conceal in previous cases.

discussion 
i.the district court inherent power 
it has long been understood that c ertain implied powers must necessarily result to our courts of justice from the nature of their institution,power which can not be dispensed with in a court,because they are necessary to the exercise of all others.chambers nasco,internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has specifically recognized that the inherent power of a federal court to investigate whether a judgment was obtained by fraud,is beyond question.universal oil prods.root refining,citing hazel atlas glass hartford empire.
this inherent power is not limited by overlapping statutes or rules.the supreme court explained that the inherent power of a court can be invoked even if procedural rules exist which sanction the same conduct.chambers,at.thus,the sanctionees argument that the district court should have relied on federal rule of civil produce fails while rule also provides a method to sanction a party for failing to comply with discovery rules,it is not the exclusive means for addressing the adequacy of a discovery response.see id.
the sanctionees also argue that the court can not impose sanctions in this case because the haegers failed to move to compel disclosure or discovery under rule,and thus the sanctionees never violated a district court order compelling disclosure or discovery.more specifically,the sanctionees contend that absent such a motion to compel or order requiring production,goodyear and its counsel complied with discovery rules,and thus the district court does not have power to sanction the sanctionees conduct.the supreme court has expressly rejected this argument.n either is a federal court forbidden to sanction conduct by means of the inherent power simply because that conduct could also be sanctioned under the statute or the rules if in the informed discretion of the court,neither the statute nor the rules are up to the task,the court may safely rely on its inherent power.id.at.we hold that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to rely on its inherent power to sanction the conduct at issue in this case,and to determine that rule did not provide the appropriate remedy,especially since the discovery fraud was not discovered until after the case had settled.
before awarding sanctions pursuant to its inherent power,the court must make an express finding that the sanctioned party behavior constituted or was tantamount to bad faith.leon idx,cir.we have found bad faith in a variety of conduct stemming from a full range of litigation abuses.chambers,at.for example a party demonstrates bad faith by delaying or disrupting the litigation primus auto.fin,batarse,cir.leon,at plaintiff demonstrated bad faith by going to extraordinary measures to destroy evidence.
actions constituting a fraud upon the court or actions that cause the very temple of justice to be defiled are also sufficient to support a bad faith finding.chambers,at.for example,in pumphrey thompson tool company,the decedent family brought a wrongful death action against a gun manufacturer after the decedent dropped the manufacturer gun with the safety devices engaged and it fired,killing the decedent.f d,cir.during trial,the manufacturer introduced tests showing that when the gun was dropped,the safeties performed as designed and the gun never fired.id.after the trial concluded,plaintiffs attorney learned that in a subsequent,unrelated lawsuit,the manufacturer had produced tests during which the gun had fired when dropped.id.these tests had not been produced during plaintiffs litigation even though they were available two months before trial,and despite the manufacturer assurance that gun tests would be made available upon their discovery.id.at.the manufacturer also affirmatively mischaracterized the nature of these tests during later discovery,and introduced testimony during trial that it had never seen the gun fire when dropped.id.at.plaintiffs moved to set aside the trial verdict,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.id.at.we upheld the district court grant of a new trial finding that the manufacturer had engaged in a scheme to defraud the jury,the court,and the plaintiffs,through the use of misleading,inaccurate,and incomplete responses to discovery requests,the presentation of fraudulent evidence,and the failure to correct the false impressions created id.at.we further held that the end result of the scheme was to undermine the judicial process,which amounts to fraud upon the court.id.citing hazel atlas glass hartford empire,deliberately planned scheme to present fraudulent evidence constitutes fraud upon the court abatti,cir fraud upon the court involves unconscionable plan or scheme to influence the court improperly.while the procedural posture of pumphrey differs from the one in this case,the similarities with this case support the conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that sanctionees engaged in fraud upon the court in their scheme to avoid their discovery obligations.
in maui police department,we found counsel reckless and knowing conduct to be tantamount to bad faith and therefore sanctionable under the court inherent power,cir emphasis in original.was a sexual harassment suit,in which defense counsel introduced testimony in violation of federal rule of evidence defense counsel introduced this testimony after two rule motions had been denied,and after he assured the district judge in a sidebar that the anticipated testimony would not violate rule.id.at.we concluded that defense counsel introduction of the testimony was a knowing and intentional violation of rule and further held that i f left unsanctioned,defense counsel behavior in this case would undermine the very purpose and force of rule strictures.id.at.in this case,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the sanctionees failure to produce relevant documents despite their affirmative obligations to do so pursuant to rules and,and their misrepresentations in numerous discovery disputes which the district court estimated took approximately sixteen hours in court,was tantamount to bad faith.the sanctionees conduct in this matter undermines the very purpose of the federal rules requiring disclosure of relevant and responsive documents.
it is clear the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that hancock,musnuff,and goodyear acted in bad faith in this litigation.the sanctionees,throughout numerous discovery dispute filings and hearings,convinced the district court that goodyear had produced all test data relevant to the haegers claims.the district court noted that i n fact,at various points the court became exasperated with plaintiffs apparently unsubstantiated claims that additional information must exist.it was not until the sanctions proceedings that the district court realized that the sanctionees had 
adopted a plan of making discovery as difficult as possible,providing only those documents they wished to provide,timing the production of the small subset of documents they were willing to turn over such that it was inordinately difficult for plaintiffs to manage their case,and making false statements to the court in an attempt to hide their behavior.
the haegers served their first request in september.the sanctionees merely objected to this request,and did not produce any documents.the sanctionees then filed supplemental responses in november,which included the production of only one group of tests the dot tests.it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to find that production of just one group of tests meant that the sanctionees had failed to search properly for relevant tests in response to the haegers first request,and had done so in bad faith.
the sanctionees then failed to disclose promptly relevant tests after a proper search had been conducted.musnuff and hancock had the high speed tests in their possession at the latest in february,yet failed to disclose promptly the high speed tests to the haegers.instead,the sanctionees chose to depose the haegers expert in may,and then produce the high speed tests in june.musnuff was next aware of more tests including the heat rise tests,dot endurance tests,crown durability tests,and bead durability tests at least by august,and hancock was aware of these same tests at least by june.however,the sanctionees again failed to disclose properly these tests upon their discovery.without producing any of these additional tests,goodyear settled with the haegers in april.
the district court concluded that the sanctionees should have turned over the high speed tests,heat rise tests,dot endurance tests,crown durability tests,and bead durability tests as soon as they were discovered,as they were all responsive to the first request.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that this decision to withhold documents was a bad faith attempt to hide responsive documents,which would not have been uncovered but for the sanctions proceedings.this finding of bad faith is bolstered by hancock repeated representations to the district court that goodyear was complying with all discovery requests when in fact,goodyear was withholding relevant and responsive documents.
any attempt by goodyear to argue that the district court abused its discretion in preventing goodyear from passing the blame on to its attorneys is unavailing.goodyear is deemed bound by the acts of its lawyers and is considered to have notice of all facts,notice of which can be charged upon the attorney.link wabash,see also lockary kayfetz,cir.additionally,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that goodyear participated directly in the discovery fraud goodyear rule b witness,authorized to testify on goodyear behalf,falsely testified during deposition that no additional tests were available beyond the high speed tests that had been turned over to the haegers and goodyear counsel,okey,maintained responsibility for reviewing and approving all the incomplete and misleading discovery responses.
we hold that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to find that hancock,musnuff and goodyear each acted in bad faith.
monetary sanctions 
once a district court makes a finding of bad faith,it has the discretion to award sanctions in the form of attorneys fees against a party or counsel.leon idx,cir quoting primus auto.fin,batarse,cir.a primary aspect of that discretion is the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.chambers nasco.
in its analysis of sanctions,the district court noted that due to the extent of the bad faith of the sanctionees in this case,had the misconduct come to light while the case was ongoing,entry of default judgment with a trial on damages would have been the obvious solution.however,since the case was settled and closed before the misconduct was discovered,the court instead was faced with the task of determining the appropriate amount of sanctions to make the plaintiffs whole in the form of attorneys fees and costs.the court found that the sanctionees had engaged in a course of misconduct,which had made it difficult for the court to separate the fees incurred due to legitimate activity from the fees and costs incurred due to goodyear refusal to abide by clear and simple discovery obligations.the court explained that if goodyear had responded to plaintiffs first request with all responsive documents,goodyear might have decided to settle the case immediately,and thus it was possible to conclude practically all of plaintiffs fees and costs were due to misconduct.the district court concluded that w hile there is some uncertainty how the litigation would have proceeded if goodyear and its attorneys were acting in good faith,based on goodyear pattern and practice in cases,the case more likely than not would have settled much earlier.thus the district court was informed in part by past settlement practices of goodyear in the other cases in reaching its determination concerning appropriate compensatory damages in this case.the district court then determined,relying upon the reasoning in chambers,that while i t is difficult to reconcile chambers with miller,the most appropriate sanction is to award plaintiffs all of the attorneys fees and costs they incurred after goodyear served its supplemental responses to plaintiffs first request as this was the first definitive proof that goodyear was not going to cooperate in the litigation process.the district court held that in these unique circumstances,it is inappropriate to limit the award to the fees and costs that could be directly linked to the misconduct proving that linkage is an almost impossible task given how the misconduct permeated the entirety of this case.
the sanctionees claim that this determination was made in error because sanctions must be directly linked to damage caused by its bad faith conduct,citing miller city of los angeles,cir.the sanctionees confidence in miller is misplaced,for three reasons miller itself recognizes that it has limited precedential value to the degree miller can be read to require that the specific amount of attorneys fees and costs awarded when a court invokes its inherent powers must be directly linked to the bad faith conduct,it flouts controlling united states supreme court case law and under chambers,the district court did all it was required to do in this case in determining the appropriate amount of fees to award as sanctions to compensate the plaintiffs for the damages they suffered as a result of sanctionees bad faith.
the panel majority opening paragraph in miller appropriately characterized its precedential value this is a strange case.its resolution hinges on the absence,as a factual matter,of something we must accept as a legal matter.there are unlikely to be many more like it,so this opinion precedential value is probably limited.id.at.what was missing the answer bad faith,an essential requirement for invoking the district court inherent powers.miller was a wrongful death suit brought against the city of los angeles,its police department,police chief,and a sergeant who shot and killed the decedent.the district court issued an in limine order precluding defendants from arguing that the decedent was armed when he was shot.id.at.the district court found that during the trial summation,defense counsel violated its in limine order by stating that before decedent was shot,decedent had shot another man,and awarded sanctions under its inherent power for the entire cost of the trial after the jury hung.counsel conceded that he had violated the court order,and even apologized for his error,but the district court nevertheless construed counsel conduct as tantamount to bad faith,granted plaintiffs motion for sanctions,and sanctioned defendants.id.there was just one problem.a careful review of the record showed that counsel had actually violated the court in limine order,despite his confession that he had done so.that put the majority of our panel into a quandary.what should one do about a lawyer who confesses a error in this case,the panel majority concluded that it was bound by what the lawyer had confessed,but that since the lawyer had not conceded bad faith,and clearly had not actually violated the court order,there could be no finding of bad faith.put another way,you ca have a bad faith violation without a violation.id.at.the case was over,and nothing more needed to be said,since a district court can not use its inherent power to sanction a party without a finding of bad faith.the balance of the panel opinion was dicta.
but even the dicta in miller is of little help to the sanctionees here.the dicta in miller addressed whether the district court linked the alleged bad faith conduct to the harm suffered,whether the district court found that the attorney alleged statement caused the jury to hang.the panel concluded that without a finding that defense counsel violation caused the first jury to hang,the district court had no power to order defendants to compensate plaintiffs for the attorneys fees and costs they spent on the first trial.id.thus,while the dicta in miller suggests that harm is necessary to compensate a party,miller makes no holding on the measure of attorneys fees allowed once it is clear that the bad faith of a party has actually caused harm in this case,however,there is no doubt that the sanctionees bad faith conduct caused significant harm in forcing the haegers to engage in sham litigation,and in their likely foregoing millions of dollars in the settlement they accepted under false pretenses of the sanctionees,as found by the district court in light of goodyear conduct in the other cases.
even though miller does not provide an answer,we next consider how close a link is required between the harm caused and the compensatory sanctions awarded when a court invokes its inherent power.the question is squarely answered by chambers nasco,the supreme court strongest statement about the use of a court inherent power.in chambers,the supreme court upheld a district court determination that full attorney fees were warranted due to the frequency and severity of the party abuses of the judicial system.at.the underlying action in chambers was a suit by nasco seeking chambers specific performance of an agreement to sell a television station facilities and broadcast license to nasco.chambers responded to the suit by attempting to put the properties at issue beyond the reach of the district court through various transfers,ignoring the district court preliminary injunction,filing meritless motions and pleadings,attempting to conduct depositions in violation of the federal rules of civil procedure,and engaging in other behavior aimed at frustrating the possibility of specific performance.the district court found these actions to be part of a sordid scheme of deliberate misuse of the judicial process designed to defeat nasco claim by harassment,repeated and endless delay,mountainous expense and waste of financial resources.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court then awarded nasco an amount which represented the entire amount of nasco litigation costs paid to its attorneys.id.at.the supreme court dismissed chambers argument,which was virtually identical to the causation requirement claim the sanctionees are making in this case,that the fact that the entire amount of fees was awarded means that the district court failed to tailor the sanction to the particular wrong,and instead upheld the district court conclusion that full attorney fees were warranted due to the frequency and severity of chambers abuses of the judicial system and the resulting need to ensure that such abuses were not repeated.id.at.the supreme court further explained that it was within the district court discretion to compensate nasco by requiring chambers to pay for all attorney fees.id.the supreme court reasoned that the district court imposed sanctions for the fraud chambers perpetrated on the court and the bad faith he displayed toward both his adversary and the court throughout the course of litigation.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.and,such sanctions both vindicat e judicial authority without resort to the more drastic sanctions available for contempt of court and mak e the prevailing party whole for expenses caused by his opponent obstinacy.id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted see also hutto finney.as a united states supreme court case,chambers clearly trumps miller,to the degree miller dicta conflicts with chambers,as well as any other ninth circuit case to the contrary.thus,even though the district court in this case struggled with how to reconcile miller with chambers,it appropriately awarded the haegers all their attorneys fees and costs in prosecuting the action once the sanctionees began flouting their clear discovery obligations and engaging in frequent and severe abuses of the judicial system.
given the teaching of chambers,the district court findings and ruling in this case regarding monetary sanctions fully comply with law.first,the supreme court expressly rejected the linkage argument made by the sanctionees here when it upheld the award for full attorney fees due to the frequency and severity of chambers abuses of the judicial system and the resulting need to ensure that such abuses were not repeated.chambers,at.secondly,it made clear that we review the district court determinations in arriving at the proper measure of compensatory damages for abuse of discretion.id.
the district court here used the lodestar method to calculate the appropriate amount of fees incurred as a result of the sanctionees bad faith,and noted that this method contemplates multiplying the reasonable hourly rate by the number of hours reasonably expended.morales city of san rafael,cir.the district court then went to great lengths in reviewing the pages of time entries submitted by the haegers,and the combination of objections by goodyear and its attorneys to a lmost every time entry to ensure the appropriate size of the award.in a order,the district court addressed each objection made by the sanctionees to the court proposed award,and made five adjustments based on these objections out of an abundance of caution,the district court imposed a twenty percent reduction of for recreation of time entries the district court held that because some of the time entry descriptions were vague incomplete,it could not conclude that this time was reasonably expended absent the appropriate information,and reduced the award by the district court reduced the award by,equaling the costs for which the haegers did not submit supporting documents the district court subtracted for time entries involving work of a clerical nature and the district court found that should be reduced for excessive billing.applying these adjustments,the district court awarded the amount the court reasonably believed it cost the haegers to litigate against a party and attorneys during the time when that party and those attorneys were acting in bad faith.nothing more is required under chambers or our case law,and,especially given the great care with which the court reviewed the relevant data during its consideration of legal fees,the court clearly did not abuse its discretion.
our dissenting colleague suggests that chambers control over this case was undermined by international union,united mine workers bagwell,and our own hanshaw enterprises,emerald river development,cir.he also suggests that the district court sanctions in this case were punitive,not compensatory.with due respect,our colleague is mistaken on both counts.bagwell involved a criminal contempt proceeding stemming out of a protracted labor strike,in which a union was found to have violated the trial court orders hundreds of times,as determined in eight separate contempt hearings.although the trial court labeled the over million it levied in fines against the union civil and coercive,bagwell,at,once the union and the companies settled their labor dispute,and moved to vacate the contempt fines,the trial judge refused to do so,declaring that they were payable in effect to the public.id.at.the supreme court appropriately treated the fines as punishment for criminal contempt,and required courts to provide additional protections to the defendants in such cases.id.at.however,even though chambers had been decided only years before by the supreme court,bagwell did not even mention chambers,let alone overrule or distinguish it.contrary to the facts in this case,the court noted 
n either any party nor any court of the commonwealth has suggested that the challenged fines are compensatory.at no point did the trial court attempt to calibrate the fines to damages caused by the union contumacious activities or indicate that the fines were to compensate the complainant for losses sustained.the nonparty governments,in turn,never requested any compensation or presented any evidence regarding their injuries,never moved to intervene in the suit,and never actively defended the fines imposed.

hanshaw,also cited by our dissenting colleague,is extremely helpful in confirming the validity of the compensatory damages awarded in this case.hanshaw involved a dispute between two wealthy brothers about a partnership dissolution.f d at.just as a receiver was about to render an accounting to the court,one of the brothers,frederick hanshaw fjh,allegedly offered the receiver a bribe of,as well as future business.id.at.when the attempted bribe came to the attention of the district court,the court referred the matter to the fbi,which,after conducting several interviews,decided not to proceed with formal criminal charges against fjh.id.at.thereafter,the district court conducted two evidentiary hearings to determine whether fjh had attempted to defraud the court and his brother.id.at.after weighing the evidence,the court concluded that there had been an attempt by fjh to bribe the receiver,and sanctioned fjh and his corporation,payable to the united states,and imposed a sanction against them in favor of his brother,gordon hanshaw gh.id.at.relying on bagwell,our court found that the sanction was clearly punitive and intended to vindicate the court authority and the integrity of the judicial process.the sanction was a substantial flat,unconditional fine was not intended to compensate gh but rather was made payable to the united states id.at.since the sanction was found to be punitive in nature,we reversed the district court because fjh and his corporation did not receive all the procedural protections to which they were entitled.id.at.
however,we upheld the district court sanction in favor of gh,despite fjh contention that it too was criminal in nature and should be vacated.id.at.we noted that a u nlike a punitive sanction,particularly one that is payable to the government or the court,a compensatory award payable to a party does not place the court in a prosecutorial role b w hen determining whether and how much to compensate a party,the court sits in the same adjudicatory position it does when it resolves most disputes.although the court has an institutional interest in the matter,the court in essence is resolving a dispute between litigants one party claims it was wronged by the other and wants to be reimbursed by the losses it sustained.for these reasons,when the court is adjudicating a compensatory civil sanction,the traditional procedural protections applicable to civil proceedings are sufficient to satisfy the constitution requirement of due process c in concluding that the award to gh was compensatory,we reasoned that t he award was payable to gh and was meant to offset the expenses he incurred because of fjh misconduct.as a result of the bribe attempt,the entire receivership process was delayed by nearly six months and gh was forced to incur additional attorney fees.the court had before it the billing reports from gh attorneys and gh had asked the court for in compensation exercising its discretion,the court awarded to gh and d b ased upon this record,we conclude that the award was intended to compensate gh for losses sustained as a result of fjh misconduct and is civil in nature.id.at citing chambers,at.
just like the district court did in hanshaw in its award to gh,the court here responded to a motion filed by the plaintiffs seeking damages for the sanctionees bad faith,and awarded as compensatory damages the amount of the attorneys fees and costs it carefully determined the haegers had actually incurred litigating against the sanctionees,during the time they were acting in bad faith.
w hether a contempt is civil or criminal turns on the character and purpose of the sanction involved,meaning a civil sanction is for the benefit of the complainant,while a criminal sanction is punitive,to vindicate the authority of the court.bagwell,at internal quotations omitted.a fine is almost always civil it if compensate s the complainant for losses sustained,id.at internal quotations omitted,whereas it is generally punitive in nature when it was not intended to compensate the party but rather is made payable to the united states.hanshaw,at.other ninth circuit cases affirm these points.in maui police department,the district court found that the sanctionees had acted in bad faith in violating the federal rules of evidence while questioning a witness about the plaintiff during trial,and awarded to compensate plaintiff for the pain and suffering caused by the public embarrassment resulting from the testimony.f d,cir.we upheld the sanction,holding that the amount the court imposed reflected its assessment of the actual harm incurred by plaintiff in emotional and reputational damage.id.at.because the district court imposed the sanctions for the purpose of compensation,they were within its discretion.
the district court in lasar ford motor company imposed monetary sanctions to compensate for unnecessary costs and attorney fees,cir.in lasar,the sanctionees attorney violated pretrial orders during his opening statement,and the court granted lasar motion for mistrial and discharged the jury.id.at.the district court then instructed lasar attorneys to prepare an affidavit detailing lasar costs and attorney fees incurred over the previous two weeks.id.while it is unclear why the district court determined that lasar should be compensated for two weeks of attorney fees,the sanctions were upheld as we determined that t he monetary sanctions imposed were compensatory in nature because they were designed to compensate lasar for unnecessary costs and attorney fees.id.at.thus,it was within the district court discretion to determine the time frame in which lasar sustained losses.
collectively,these cases make clear that the sanctions awarded here were entirely lawful and appropriate.not one dime was awarded to the government or the court.just like the district court in f.hanshaw,the district court here awarded compensatory damages after the aggrieved party filed a motion,seeking compensation for damages suffered as a result of the bad faith of the opposing party.in awarding compensatory damages,the district court did not act as a prosecutor,but instead allowed the accused and accusing parties to file extensive briefs,and held extensive hearings to determine the truth of what had happened.it took great care in parsing and reducing the attorney fee claims of the plaintiffs.the accused were granted full due process and afforded all the protections required in civil sanctions hearings.while the district court had an institutional interest in the proceedings just like the district court did in hanshaw,its stated purpose was to properly compensate the plaintiffs for damages they suffered as the result of the sanctionees fraudulent conduct.in sum,the district court acted well within its discretion in awarding all the attorneys fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs after goodyear served its supplemental responses to plaintiffs first request.
non monetary sanctions 
the district court also used its inherent power to order goodyear to file a copy of the order in any case initiated after the date of that order.the district court reasoned that b ased on goodyear history of engaging in serious discovery misconduct in every case brought to this court attention,filing this order in future cases will alert plaintiffs and the courts that goodyear has,in the past,not operated in good faith when litigating such cases.the district court found that this would serve as a notice of the existence of certain tests goodyear attempted to conceal in previous cases.the district court did not limit this requirement in either time or scope.goodyear argues that this sanction is too severe as it impacts the fairness of unrelated proceedings,and thus should be reversed as an abuse of the district court discretion.
courts have the inherent power to impose various sanctions.see thompson hous.auth.of los angeles,cir inherent power includes power to impose sanctions including,where appropriate,default or dismissal anheuser busch,natural beverage,cir dismissal pursuant to inherent powers hester vision airlines,cir affirming order striking answer and entering default judgment.however,even if a given sanction is available,the scope of the sanction must also be appropriate.lewis.emps.credit union,cir.a sanction should be carefully fashioned to deny the party the fruits of its misconduct yet not to interfere with the party future rights.id.
in hale trustee,a bankruptcy court imposed a sanction that regulated future conduct in response to specific and repeated acts of incompetent and irresponsible representation,cir.the court found a bankruptcy attorney to be u nable or unwilling to conform his conduct to the requirements established by the court prior decisions and ruling,and to the standards by which all other debtors counsel in the district abide.id.at.we upheld the bankruptcy court sanction which required that the attorney not file,nor shall he prepare or cause to be prepared for filing by a debtor,any bankruptcy petitioner unless the attorney signs said petition.id.additionally,the attorney was directed not to file,nor assist a debtor as counsel in filing,any bankruptcy petition unless the attorney commits to such debtor to meet the ethical and professional obligations of a debtor attorney and provide the reasonable and necessary services required to properly represent a debtor in a bankruptcy case.id.thus,this chosen sanction regulated the attorney practice and specific actions that the attorney was required to take with all future clients.we held that u nder the specific acts of this case,we can not say that the bankruptcy court abused its inherent power to impose sanctions.id.at.
we are persuaded by the reasoning of hale.we are also persuaded by the reasoning of gallop cheney,a second circuit case addressing the same issue.cir.the plaintiff claims in gallop were dismissed by the district court as frivolous,and the second circuit affirmed the dismissal on appeal.id.at.the second circuit then ordered plaintiff and her counsel,including dennis cunningham,to show cause why the court should not impose sanctions for what it held to be a frivolous appeal.in response,plaintiff moved to disqualify the three members of the panel from considering her petition for rehearing and rehearing in banc.id.the court sanctioned plaintiff counsel for filing a frivolous appeal,and then imposed additional sanctions for filing the frivolous motion to disqualify.id.at.the court held that cunningham acted in bad faith in demanding the recusal of the three panel members and any colleagues,and ordered cunningham to provide notice of the sanctions imposed upon him in this case to any federal court in this circuit before which he appears or seeks to appear for a period of one year.id.
the district court here imposed the sanction so that future plaintiffs and courts would be alerted that goodyear had previously not operated in good faith,and so that future plaintiffs would be aware of the types of tests available.we agree with the district court reasoning,particularly in light of the fact that it is highly likely that most future litigation will be filed in state courts see,the other cases,and state court counsel will not necessarily investigate what might be contained in the federal reporter about the conduct of goodyear and its counsel.we note also that the district court provided a form of safety valve in its sanctions because goodyear may apply to the court hearing the case to be excused from the requirements of the order.
we find that the district court imposition of sanctions against goodyear is balanced,is narrowly tailored,and imposes no sanctions beyond what is necessary to remedy what the district court properly perceived as an ongoing problem in goodyear litigation.the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions on goodyear.
conclusion 
for the reasons noted in this opinion,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions in the sum of against hancock,and jointly against musnuff and goodyear.the district also did not abuse it discretion in imposing sanctions against goodyear.
we affirm the monetary and sanctions set forth in the district court order.
the sanctionees shall bear all costs in this appeal.
goodyear and its lawyers were accused in this case of perpetrating a fraud on the haegers and the court.if sustained,those charges could of course severely damage the professional reputations of the lawyers involved.the district court accordingly approached the task of determining whether the charges were true with great thoroughness and care.after conducting a lengthy evidentiary hearing and reviewing multiple rounds of briefing,the court concluded that goodyear and its lawyers acted in bad faith when they failed to produce test results that were responsive to the haegers document requests.i agree with the majority that the district court misconduct findings are supported by the record,but i nevertheless conclude that the million sanctions award must be vacated.
the district court finding of bad faith authorized it to levy sanctions under its inherent power.chambers nasco.those sanctions could have taken one of two forms punitive sanctions,which are criminal in nature and intended to vindicate the authority of the court or compensatory sanctions,which are civil in nature and designed to compensate the injured party for losses sustained as a result of the misconduct.miller city of los angeles,cir f.hanshaw enterprises,emerald river development,cir 
the district court chose not to impose punitive sanctions.doing so would have required the court to follow procedures applicable in criminal cases,such as appointing an independent prosecutor,affording the accused the right to a jury trial,and demanding proof of misconduct beyond a reasonable doubt.miller,at.compensatory sanctions,by contrast,may be imposed by the court acting alone after providing adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard.lasar ford motor,cir.that is the route the district court chose to follow here.the question for us is whether the court correctly labeled the sanctions compensatory.if it did
