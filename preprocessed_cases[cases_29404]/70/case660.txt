petitioner lisa mary brought an action below for damages,alleging fraud and other claims arising out of an investment of.she sued,among others,thomas schellenberg and his wife,katherine mills.schellenberg and mills are sometimes referred to herein collectively as real parties in interest,or real parties.schellenberg and mills each propounded requests for admissions rfas directed to mary,which consisted collectively of individual rfas.after making two written requests for a extension to respond,and after schellenberg denied the extension request one day after the due date for the responses,counsel for mary served responses to the rfas.they were served four days late,on july.four days later,real parties,without any attempt to meet and confer,filed a motion motion with the respondent superior court requesting that the rfas in their entirety be deemed admitted,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b the court granted the motion as to the schellenberg rfas,deemed of the rfas admitted,and awarded sanctions in favor of real parties.the court order omitted any reference to the motion to deem admitted the rfas propounded by mills upon mary.
mary seeks a writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate its order deeming the schellenberg rfas admitted.she contends in her petition that real parties motion was defective in that it did not constitute a motion to compel further responses to rfas under section.she argues further that real parties improperly included new matter for the first time in their reply papers namely,argument directed to mary responses to specific schellenberg rfas that real parties claimed were deficient and that the court granted the motion based upon the presentation of such new arguments.mary asserts that the impact of the court order is extremely significant because,among other things,six of the rfas deemed admitted are specifically directed to a potential statute of limitations defense asserted by real parties.
in response,real parties raise several procedural objections to the petition,including its timeliness in addition,real parties assert,among other things,that mary has failed to demonstrate clear error entitling her to relief the statutes under which real parties motion was brought and the additional statute governing motions to compel further responses to rfas are clear and the untimely responses to rfas served by mary were not substantially compliant with the code of civil procedure.
we conclude that respondent court erred in granting real parties motion by deeming admitted of the schellenberg rfas.accordingly,we will grant the petition and order a writ of mandamus to issue commanding respondent to vacate its order and issue a new and different order denying real parties motion pursuant to section,subdivision b as to the rfas propounded upon mary.
procedural background 
i.the complaint 
mary filed her complaint on april,alleging claims sounding in fraud against schellenberg,mills,and david nilsen collectively,defendants,arising out of the investment of her life savings of.according to the pleading caption,mary asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty,fraudulent concealment,conflict of interest,affirmative misrepresentation,fraudulent concealment in connection with the sale of an interest in real property,embezzlement,and a request for an accounting.
it is alleged by mary that after having heard a radio advertisement in december promoting investment opportunities in cedar funding,she called the telephone number indicated in the radio advertisement and was referred to schellenberg,who was identified as director,new business for cedar funding,and as a real estate loan consultant.schellenberg provided written materials to mary and later recommended that she make a loan to his wholly owned separate venture,neo ventures,to facilitate ongoing substantial renovations of residential property located at street in pacific grove subject property.he represented that in exchange for her investment,she would receive an undivided majority interest in an already existing promissory note and an already recorded deed of trust recorded against and secured by the subject property.schellenberg represented to mary that this deed of trust would ultimately be in first priority,that the subject property would be worth,and that her investment would be protected.
mary alleges further in her complaint that defendants intended to defraud her by inducing her to advance for their personal,secret and prohibited use and enjoyment instead of action for the benefit of protection of mary in a transaction lending her investment out to a third person on a safe and fully secured loan with the represented adequate equity as security,defendants always intended to convert the proceeds of the loan to their own personal use and benefit and did so.mary alleges that she provided the funds to defendants in january in reasonable and justifiable reliance upon their representations.by march,defendants had fraudulently but secretly extracted using the subject property as the basis for the financial transactions.original emphasis omitted.mary never received any security as promised,and her entire investment was lost after the bankruptcy of cedar funding,and the foreclosure of the subject property effectuated by a lienholder bank.she became aware of the vast fraudulent operations of defendants in may.
ii.the rfas and responses 
on june,schellenberg served by mail upon mary a set of rfas,seeking that she admit or deny certain specified matters on the same date,mills served by mail upon mary a set of rfas,seeking that she admit or deny specified matters.mary was therefore required to serve her responses to the schellenberger rfas and the mills rfas on or before july,subd.a.
on july four days late mary served her responses to the schellenberg and mills rfas by facsimile and mail.prior to this tardy service of the responses,and on or before the july deadline for service of the responses,counsel for mary,david hollingsworth based upon the volume of the discovery and his involvement in preparing for a federal jury trial requested that real parties grant him a extension to complete the responses real parties did not respond to the extension request until after the responses were due.on july,schellenberg faxed a letter to hollingsworth granting a extension,subject to the condition that mary immediately file a dismissal with prejudice of the action as to mills.
iii.real parties motion to have rfas deemed admitted 
on july four days after receipt by facsimile of the responses to the rfas real parties filed a motion to have the schellenberg and mills rfas propounded upon mary deemed admitted real parties acknowledged that mary had belatedly served responses to the two sets of rfas,and they attached those responses to the respective declarations of schellenberg and mills filed in support of the motion.real parties contended that mary responses were defective,legally deficient,and a nullity.they repeated this conclusory statement serially in the memorandum filed in support of the motion.the motion contained no reference to any particular response by mary to any of the rfas to explain real parties claim that the responses were defective or legally deficient.indeed,other than being served four days late,there was no basis for real parties claim that mary responses to the mills rfas were deficient each response consisted of a admission or denial.
on august,mary counsel and schellenberg appeared at a case management conference.there was substantial discussion between hollingsworth,schellenberg,and the court concerning the motion,outstanding interrogatory responses due from mary to real parties concerning mary denials of any of the rfas,and hollingsworth unavailability for a portion of august due to a federal jury trial.the court suggested that it might be appropriate for the parties to arrive at a compromise under which mary would agree to serve responses to the interrogatories by a date certain,in exchange for which real parties would vacate the hearing on the motion.at the conclusion of the conference,schellenberg stipulated that if he had received mary responses to interrogatories in his hands by the end of business on august,he would drop the motion.
hollingsworth,on behalf of mary,filed opposition to the motion on august.that opposition emphasized the collective volume of the rfas hollingsworth unsuccessful attempts to obtain a extension to respond real parties belated reply to the extension request made after the responses were due in which they conditioned the grant of an extension upon the extortionate demand that mills be dismissed with prejudice and the fact that mary responses to both sets of rfas were received by real parties before they filed the motion,and she had thus substantially complied with section,notwithstanding that the responses were four days late.hollingsworth also noted that he had cured a technical issue with the responses to the rfas his failure to sign them as counsel once he was made aware of the issue by a statement made in the motion.
real parties filed a reply in support of their motion on august 
at the hearing on the motion on august,schellenberg personally appeared and hollingsworth appeared by telephone.after the court determined that the parties disagreed as to whether hollingsworth had complied by serving the interrogatory responses on august,in compliance with the conditional stipulation under which real parties agreed to drop the motion,the court heard the merits of the motion it found that some of the responses complied with the code of civil procedure,but some did not.the court concluded that the motion as to the responses to the schellenberg rfas should be granted,and that any responses that were not unqualified denials would be deemed admitted.it entered an order the same day granting real parties motion,deeming admitted of the schellenberg rfas it concluded that as to those rfa responses,mary had failed to serve responses in substantial compliance with section 
mary filed a motion for reconsideration of the court order granting the motion.on october,the court denied the motion for reconsideration.
iv.petition for writ of mandate 
mary filed her petition for writ of mandate with this court on october on november,we issued an order staying all trial court proceedings and a palma notice indicating that we were considering issuing a peremptory writ of mandate in the first instance.real parties filed their opposition on december,and mary filed her reply on january.

our high court has indicated that this abuse of discretion standard is founded on principles of deference to the trial court,such as whether or not the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered in re marriage of connolly cal d,and that that appellate courts should disturb discretionary trial court rulings only upon a showing of a clear case of abuse and a miscarriage of justice blank kirwan cal d.but these broad principles should not be read as permitting an appellate court to reverse a trial court based upon abuse of discretion only if its action was utterly irrational.city of sacramento drew d.as our high court later explained,the court discretion is not unlimited and it must be exercised within the confines of the applicable legal principles.sargon enterprises,university of southern california cal th.the court explained further the discretion of a trial judge is not a whimsical,uncontrolled power,but a legal discretion,which is subject to the limitations of legal principles governing the subject of its action,and to reversal on appeal where no reasonable basis for the action is shown.citations.the scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied,in the legal principles governing the subject of the action action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.citation.the legal principles that govern the subject of discretionary action vary greatly with context.citation.they are derived from the common law or statutes under which discretion is conferred.citation.to determine if a court abused its discretion,we must thus consider the legal principles and policies that should have guided the court actions.citation.ibid.thus,a ction that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.citation.city of sacramento drew,supra,d at.

ii.requests for admissions and related discovery motions 
a party may request that another litigant admit the genuineness of specified documents,or the truth of specified matters of fact,opinion relating to fact,or application of law to fact.a request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.unless the responding party moves promptly for a protective order under section,he or she,within days of service of the rfas,shall respond in writing under oath and separately to each rfa,subd.a and shall answer the substance of the requested admission,or set forth an objection to the particular request,subd,b.each response to the rfas must be complete and straightforward,subd.a.the responding party shall admit as much of the request that is true,either as expressed in the request itself or as reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party,subd.b d eny so much of the matter involved in the request as is untrue,subd.b or s pecify so much of the matter involved in the request as to the truth of which the responding party lacks sufficient information or knowledge,subd.b 
rfas are different from other civil discovery tools such as depositions,interrogatories,and requests for documents.most of the other discovery procedures are aimed primarily at assisting counsel to prepare for trial.requests for admissions,on the other hand,are primarily aimed at setting at rest a triable issue so that it will not have to be tried.thus,such requests,in a most definite manner,are aimed at expediting the trial.cembrook superior court cal d,cembrook see also studll sparrow th,studll instead of seeking to uncover information,rfas seek to eliminate the need for proof.as has been explained in one treatise the request for admission differs fundamentally from the other five discovery tools depositions,interrogatories,inspection demands,medical examinations,and expert witness exchanges.these devices principally seek to obtain proof for use at trial.in marked contrast,admission requests seek to eliminate the need for proof t he purpose of the admissions procedure is to limit the triable issues and spare the parties the burden and expense of litigating undisputed issues.sometimes,the admissions obtained will even leave the party making them vulnerable to summary judgment.hogan and weber,cal.civil discovery ed,fns.omitted,quoting shepard morgan lee daniel,cal d.matters that are admitted or deemed admitted through rfa discovery devices are conclusively established in the litigation and are not subject to being contested through contradictory evidence.murillo superior court th,murillo.
prior to and the enactment of the civil discovery act,a party propounding rfas was required to include a warning that noncompliance would result in the rfas being deemed admitted in the event timely responses were not served and the propounding party then served a statutory notice that the rfas had been deemed admitted,the nonresponding party would then have days to make a motion for relief from default under section to avoid the rfas becoming binding admissions.wilcox birtwhistle cal th,wilcox.this practice,however,was problematic because it was too draconian and imposed a sanction for nonresponse or tardy response that was out of all proportion to the abuse of discovery and created no incentive for a party willing to make the admissions to serve an actual response.citations.id.at.
under the rfa procedure postdating the civil discovery act,a propounding party must take affirmative steps by bringing a formal deemed admitted motion to have rfas to which timely responses are not received deemed admitted.in the event responses to rfas are not timely served,responding party waives any objections thereto,subd.a,and t he requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted,as well as for a monetary sanction,subd.b.unless the court determines that the responding party has served,before the hearing on the motion,a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with section,it must order the rfas deemed admitted,subd.c.a deemed admitted order establishes,by judicial fiat,that a nonresponding party has responded to the requests by admitting the truth of all matters contained therein.wilcox,supra,cal th at.the court must also impose monetary sanctions upon the party the attorney for the failure to serve a timely response to the rfas,subd.c.but a responding party service,prior to the hearing on the deemed admitted motion,of substantially compliant responses,will defeat a propounding party attempt under section to have the rfas deemed admitted.tobin oris th,tobin.as one court put it if the party manages to serve its responses before the hearing,the court has no discretion but to deny the motion.but woe betide the party who fails to serve responses before the hearing.in that instance the court has no discretion but to grant the admission motion,usually with fatal consequences for the defaulting party.one might call it two strikes and you out as applied to civil procedure.demyer costa mesa mobile home estates th,fns.omitted demyer.
if the propounding party believes that the responses to rfas are deficient in some respect or that any objections thereto are not well taken,he or she may make a motion to compel further responses under section.see wimberly derby cycle th,tobin,supra,th at,fn.section provides that such a motion to compel further responses may be made within days of service of the responses,subd.c if the propounding party asserts that the particular answer or answers are evasive or incomplete or the objection or objections are without merit or too general,subd.a.the court is required to impose sanctions upon the unsuccessful party or attorney for the party in connection with a motion to compel further responses,unless it finds that the one subject to sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust,subd.d.and if the responding party disobeys an order compelling further responses made under section,the court is empowered to order that the matters involved in the requests be deemed admitted impose monetary sanctions,subd.e.
iii.order deeming rfas admitted was an abuse of discretion 
nature of deemed admitted motion 
we first address the nature of the motion brought by real parties,because resolution of this issue is directly germane to the propriety of the challenged order.as discussed ante,there are three types of motions that a party propounding rfas may initiate motions to deem rfas admitted based upon the responding party failure to serve any responses at all in a timely fashion,subd.b motions to compel further responses to rfas where the responses are claimed to be inadequate or the objections improper,subd.a and motions to deem responses admitted for sanctions based upon the responding party disobedience of an order compelling further responses,subd.e.it is clear for a number of reasons that the motion was of the type pursuant to section,subdivision b.
first,the motion did not include a statement that real parties were seeking to compel further responses because they were inadequate or deficient.second,real parties made no reference in their motion to any of the specific,tardy rfa responses of mary that were allegedly substantively inadequate.nor did they describe in the motion with any specificity the basis for their generalized and repeated claim that the responses were defective,legally deficient,and a nullity.third,neither the notice nor memorandum in support of the motion contained a reference to section,the statute governing motions to compel further rfa responses.fourth,the motion included no declaration indicating any meet and confer attempts made by real parties in an effort to avoid bringing the motion.clearly,such a declaration would have been required for a motion to compel further responses,subd.b see also court shall impose sanction for failure to meet and confer as required under civil discovery act.indeed,real parties stated in the motion that there is no meet and confer obligation at all a true statement for a deemed admitted motion brought under section weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,but an incorrect one for motions to compel further responses,subd.b.fifth,the motion was not accompanied by the requisite separate statement,under which the moving party,as to each allegedly inadequate rfa response,must state individually the rfa,the rfa response,and the factual and legal reasons why the response is inadequate.cal.rules of court,rule see mills bank th,failure to include separate statement required by rules of court provided justification of court denial of discovery motion.
thus,it is clear that real parties motion was one to deem the rfas admitted based upon the responding party failure to serve timely any responses at all under section,subdivision b.real parties acknowledged below and in their opposition to the petition here that the motion was to deem rfas admitted section,subdivision b,and was not a motion to compel further responses section,subdivision a.but as we will explain,post,real parties in their reply memorandum filed below and the court at the hearing on the motion effectively and improperly transmuted the motion from a deemed admitted motion into a motion to compel further responses.
b.the court erred in deeming the rfas admitted 
as noted,in the event timely rfa responses are not served,the court is required to grant the propounding party deemed admitted motion unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,before the hearing on the motion,a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with section,subd.c.thus,a responding party service of a tardy proposed rfa response that is substantially will defeat a deemed admitted motion.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial,supra,to.here,mary served her proposed response to the rfas not only before the hearing on the motion,but even before the motion was even filed.thus,the key question is whether her proposed rfa response substantially complied with the requirements of section.
the civil discovery act does not include a definition of substantial compliance in the context of service of a proposed rfa response that complies with section.and very few cases have addressed the circumstances under which a proposed,untimely rfa response will be deemed to be qualitatively not in substantial compliance with the code.see,allen pacific,superior court th,unverified rfa response is not in substantial compliance with the law,disapproved on other grounds in wilcox,supra,cal th at appleton superior court d,rfa response that is unverified tantamount to no response at all.we therefore turn to case law generally addressing substantial statutory compliance.
substantial compliance,as the phrase is used in the decisions,means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute.stasher harger haldeman cal d,stasher.where there is compliance as to all matters of substance technical deviations are not to be given the stature of noncompliance.citation.substance prevails over form.southern pac.transportation state bd.of equalization d,see also western states petroleum board of equalization cal th.our high court has more recently explained with respect to the passage from stasher this formulation is unobjectionable so long as it is understood to mean that each objective or purpose of a statute must be achieved in order to satisfy the substantial compliance standard,but this language can not properly be understood to require actual compliance with every specific statutory requirement.costa superior court cal th,fn.costa.an appellate court in a more recent case succinctly observed substantial compliance with a statute is dependent on the meaning and purpose of the statute.freeman vista de santa barbara associates,lp th,freeman.
we turn to examine whether mary proposed response to the schellenberg rfas substantially complied with section.initially,we take issue with respondent court approach.the court examined the individual rfa responses,determined that some of them were not,and found explicitly in its announced reasoning at the hearing,and implicitly in the subsequent order that the remaining rfa responses did,in fact,comply with section.it therefore deemed admitted the rfas corresponding with the responses it determined to have been noncompliant,implicitly denying the deemed admitted motion as to the responses to the remaining rfas.
we find no authority for this piecemeal approach to adjudicating a tardy,proposed rfa response filed by a responding party prior to the hearing on a deemed admitted motion.subdivision c of section requires the court to evaluate whether the proposed response to the requests for admission substantially complies with section.italics added.this suggests that the court evaluate qualitatively the proposed response to rfas in toto to determine whether it substantially complies with the code.it does not permit the court to segregate each individual rfa response for the purpose of finding that portions of the document are and will therefore be accepted,while concluding that other portions are noncompliant and will thus be rejected.furthermore,the fact that there is an effective statutory vehicle by which a propounding party may seek a court order compelling a responding party to cure individual rfa responses deemed not to be in compliance with section namely,a motion to compel further responses under section offers additional support for our view that the court seriatim approach to mary proposed response to the rfas was improper.we therefore conclude that the court misapplication of section in granting the deemed admitted motion in part and denying it in part constituted an abuse of discretion.see city of sacramento drew,supra,d at a ction that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.
were we to disregard the court failure to evaluate mary proposed response to rfas in its entirety to determine its compliance with section,we would nonetheless conclude that the court erred.first,the proposed response to the rfas was verified as required by section,subdivision a.allen pacific,superior court,supra,th at unverified response to rfas did not substantially comply with law.further,mary response was unquestionably,at least as it concerned the responses to of the individual rfas they consisted of admit or deny responses 
moreover,the court conclusion that the responses to the remaining rfas did not substantially comply with section based upon reasoning stated at the hearing that each response was not unequivocal and was incomplete because each contained additional language besides an admission or denial was incorrect.this finding was apparently based upon the faulty premise that it is universally improper for a responding party to include any explanation in denying or admitting an individual rfa.although a denial of all or any portion of the request must be unequivocal citation reasonable qualifications are not improper.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial,supra,see also hogan and weber,cal.civil discovery,supra,to.thus,for instance,the rfa response,as framed,denied,was held to constitute a legally sufficient denial.smith circle p ranch d,see also holguin superior court d,fn.rfa responses proper despite rather weaseling qualification attached to most of them that they are made on advice of counsel.
an examination of a small sample of the rfa responses the court found deficient illustrates the point.mary response to rfa number admit you attended a meeting with david nilsen on or about january,was admit.thomas schellenberg was also present.this response admitted the statement and was not improper.mary response to rfa number admit that you intended on purchasing a fractional interest in a real estate secured note and deed of trust from cedar funding,was admit,first position only.this was also a proper admission to the statement,and the fact that it included a short statement further explaining the nature of mary intent beyond what was included in the rfa did not render the response improper.mary response to rfa number admit that you knew during the month of march,that there were problems at cedar funding,was deny.there seemed to be rational explanations for tardiness.this response was also apparently a straightforward denial that included an explanation as to the reason the statement was denied.
mary responded to rfa number admit you received a letter from david nilsen,owner of cedar funding,on or about april,telling you that there were problems at cedar funding,with the following deny.that letter dated april,was by no means a statement of problems at cedar funding,but attribution of all delays to the worldwide financial markets are in turmoil due to the effects of the mortgage markets,and investment banks like bear stearns.in fact,on at,schellenberg answered my inquiry of one hour earlier by personally attributing all problems to a declining,problematic economy and urging me to discount rumor and fear,innuendo and imagination.all problems fully known and understood by schellenberg and nilsen were continued to be concealed.sic.in this response,mary attempted to deny that the specified letter had the content as described in the rfa.without us determining conclusively whether it was in full compliance with section,it constituted a denial that was in substantial compliance with the statute 
our review of the totality of mary proposed response to the schellenberg rfas an approach not taken by
