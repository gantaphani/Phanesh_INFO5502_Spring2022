some months thereafter,davis filed a complaint against hutchins alleging that he had violated various sections of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et,including false representation of attorney involvement,false threat to sue and misleading statement of legal consequences of a lawsuit,failure to provide notice,and failure to provide statutorily required validation notice.
in the complaint,davis defined the proposed class as all persons in illinois from whom hutchins attempted to collect a debt allegedly owed to burlington coat factory,within one year before the filing of the complaint.as the only named plaintiff in the complaint,davis sought to be appointed as representative of the class,which he alleged consisted of more than persons.
hutchins was served with the complaint on august.he then chose to represent himself in this matter,and the following debacle ensued.
hutchins responded to the complaint by mailing a document entitled brief in support of motion to dismiss to the clerk of the district court in chicago with a copy to counsel for davis.no motion to dismiss accompanied the brief,and the brief exceeded the page limit allowed by the local rules of the district court.hutchins did not send a notice of presentment,also as required by the local rules.further,on the cover letter that hutchins sent to the clerk but not on his brief he listed the wrong case number.as a result,on august,the clerk misfiled the brief,and the filing did not show up on the docket for this case.to add to these transgressions,hutchins also failed to enter an appearance.
on september,counsel for davis contacted hutchins by fax to inform him of the several deficiencies,including the fact that the court docket did not reflect that hutchins had filed anything.davis attorney indicated that he would move for a default if hutchins did not file a proper response to the complaint.
in turn,hutchins made multiple calls to the district court case manager and the trial court courtroom deputy clerk regarding the status of his motion.at some point during these calls hutchins realized that he had put the wrong case number on the cover letter and suggested to the case manager that his brief might be found under that wrong number.
on september,the courtroom deputy clerk called hutchins to inform him that his brief had been located,but that the notice of presentment was missing and the page limit had been exceeded.she told him that she would return the documents to him and he could make corrections.during this call,she also informed hutchins that an initial status hearing on the case had been set for october.hutchins asked her if he needed to appear telephonically at the october status conference.according to hutchins,she informed him that if he returned the corrected documents there would be no need to appear,and further,that the court generally did not require personal appearances for a motion to dismiss.
on september,davis attorney faxed hutchins a request,an interrogatory,and a request that hutchins contact him for a discovery conference.hutchins responded to the requests by faxing the cover sheet back to davis attorney with a handwritten notation stating,you guys are pretty funny with a smiley face drawn after the statement.this was the only response hutchins ever made to the discovery requests.
three days later,on october,davis filed a motion for default.the motion for default was sent to hutchins with a notice that it would be presented on october at the previously scheduled status hearing.
hutchins returned his brief in support of motion to dismiss to the court on october,and noticed it for hearing on october.he also filed a motion to accept a brief in excess of the page limit.again,however,he failed to file an actual motion to dismiss or enter an appearance.
on the morning of october,davis,by his counsel,appeared before the district court for the status hearing and to present his motion for default.hutchins failed to show.the courtroom deputy clerk explained at the beginning of the hearing that hutchins original brief had been misfiled and contained certain errors,but that the problems appeared to be corrected.
davis attorney,however,argued that default was still appropriate based on the fact that hutchins had still not filed an appearance,that he had not filed a proper response to the complaint,and that he had responded to counsel discovery requests with a flippant refusal to participate in discovery.the district judge ordered default entered against hutchins and thereafter set november as the date for the damage.
though default had been entered,the hearing for hutchins motion to dismiss remained on the court docket for october.on that day,davis attorney appeared to oppose the motion,but once again hutchins failed to show.consequently,the district court struck hutchins motion for want of prosecution.apparently,also on october,the clerk office received by mail hutchins motion for reconsideration of the court default order,which he noticed for hearing on october.
on october,hutchins actually appeared in court to argue his motion to reconsider the default entry.the judge,however,did not find satisfactory his explanations for why he still had not filed an appearance,why he failed to comply with the local rules on filing motions,why he refused to participate in discovery,and why he failed to appear at either the october or october hearings.not surprisingly,the motion to reconsider was denied.
on october,davis filed a brief in support of his damages claim.davis sought actual damages of,statutory damages of,and attorney fees of roughly.on behalf of the class,davis sought a statutory damage award.
hutchins did not file a brief opposing the damages claim.he did file a brief on october in opposition to class certification,in which he argued that davis could not satisfy the numerosity requirement or show that his claim was typical to the proposed class.he did,however,attach an affidavit to the brief that asserted that his salary at goldman was per year,that he had over in loans,and in unsecured debt,and therefore had no ability to satisfy davis requested judgment.
on november,the date set for the original damage hearing,hutchins again failed to attend
