background 
monsanto developed a genetic modification in soybean seeds,marketed under the roundup ready rr brand name and known as the event the rr trait,which enables soybean plants to tolerate the application of glyphosate herbicide that kills weeds.see monsanto,ecf,slip op.at,partial judgment on the pleadings.monsanto owns patent re e the patent,which covers the rr trait.in,monsanto granted pioneer hi bred international,pioneer a nonexclusive license to produce and sell soybean seeds containing monsanto traits.after pioneer became a subsidiary of dupont,monsanto and pioneer entered into an amended and restated roundup ready soybean license agreement on april,the license,which superseded the license.under the license,dupont produced and sold soybean seeds that were due to the rr trait.monsanto,ecf,slip op.at.
in,dupont announced that it had developed its own trait,optimum gat ogat,which was expected to confer tolerance to both glyphosate and acetolactate synthase inhibitor herbicide.dupont intended to commercialize the ogat trait,but subsequent testing indicated that ogat alone did not provide sufficient for commercial use.dupont therefore stacked,or combined,its ogat trait with monsanto rr trait and discovered that the stack provided increased yields in field trials.appellant br.dupont did not sell any soybean product,however,and discontinued its development in or.reply br.
in may,monsanto sued dupont for breach of the license and infringement of the patent.monsanto maintained that the license did not allow dupont to stack the rr trait with another trait,such as ogat,or to commercialize the stacked product.monsanto,ecf,slip op.at.dupont answered and counterclaimed that the license permitted it to stack ogat with rr and that if the license were interpreted to restrict or preclude the stack,then the license should be reformed.monsanto,ecf,at.june,answer and counterclaims.dupont also asserted antitrust counterclaims.id.
the license provides in section that 
a subject to the terms of this agreement,monsanto hereby grants to licensee,and licensee,hereby accepts,a license within the licensed field to develop,use,produce,have produced,offer to sell,sell and import licensed commercial seed 
e the parties agree that except for applicable patents,licensee shall be free to introduce any gene trait into,and commercialize as set forth in subparagraph a,licensed commercial seed without the prior consent of monsanto,except as specifically provided in subparagraph g and h 
g licensee shall not be entitled to iv use biological materials outside the licensed field 
i licensee agrees not to commercialize a variety of licensed commercial seed which carries a gene or genes not supplied by monsanto and which results in increased tolerance to a nonglyphosate herbicide without the prior written consent of monsanto which consent shall not be withheld if licensee reasonably demonstrates that the introduction of such herbicide tolerance gene s does not increase the injury from glyphosate application to the crop 
emphases added.the term licensed field is defined in section as licensed commercial seed which exhibit protection against glyphosate herbicide solely due to the presence of the glyphosate tolerant soybean event.id.at emphasis added.
the district court granted partial judgment on the pleadings to monsanto in january,holding that the license was unambiguous and did not grant dupont the right to stack trait technologies with the licensed trait.monsanto,ecf,slip op.at.the court reasoned that the primary license grant provision,section a,was limited to a license to produce and sell licensed commercial seed within the licensed field.id.at.in view of the licensed field definition in section,the court concluded that licensed commercial seed may only exhibit glyphosate resistance that is solely due to,and thus that the stack was outside the licensed field because it generated glyphosate resistance that was not solely due to.id.at emphasis in original.the court therefore dismissed dupont counterclaim.id.at.
on january,dupont moved for reconsideration and sought to restore its counterclaim to reform the license.monsanto,ecf,motion for reconsideration.dupont also moved for leave to file a second amended answer and counterclaims saac to add three contract reformation counterclaims.monsanto,ecf,motion for leave to amend.dupont contended that the amendments were the product of additional investigations into the factual basis for reformation.id.at.
the district court declined to reconsider its ruling that the license did not grant dupont a right to create stacked seed products.monsanto,ecf,slip op.at.july,order on motions for reconsideration and for leave to amend.while noting that it would be difficult for defendants to prove their reformation claims,especially given the clear and convincing evidence standard,id.at,the court nonetheless granted dupont leave to file the saac to assert reformation counterclaims and defenses,id.at.
in the saac,dupont acknowledged that it intended to commercialize the stack and asserted that the license should be reformed to reflect the parties understanding that it would not restrict dupont from developing the stack.monsanto,ecf,at.dupont based the amended reformation counterclaims on three alternative grounds mutual mistake,dupont unilateral mistake and monsanto knowing silence,and monsanto fraud.id.at.
to support those counterclaims,dupont asserted that a t all times during the drafting and execution of the license,pioneer and dupont thought that the license did not prohibit pioneer from stacking other traits or genes,including traits or genes for glyphosate tolerance id.at.dupont also asserted that pioneer and dupont and monsanto agents all understood that the licensed field term,including the language solely due to the presence of has nothing to do with stacking restrictions,and that pioneer and dupont did not at any time understand the licensed field term to restrict pioneer from stacking traits or genes that provide similar protection as the licensed trait.id.at.
during discovery,both parties filed motions that required the district court frequent intervention.concerning dupont reformation counterclaims,monsanto moved to compel production of documents relating to dupont understanding of stacking restrictions under the license.monsanto,ecf.the district court ruled that,by asserting reformation claims based on mutual mistake and unilateral mistake,dupont had placed its subjective belief concerning its stacking rights at issue,the truthful resolution of which require ed an examination of communications.monsanto,ecf,slip op.at.may.the court consequently gave dupont the option to either voluntarily dismiss these reformation claims or produce to monsanto all documents bearing on these issues that it previously withheld.id.at.
dupont chose to continue litigating its reformation counterclaims and produced previously withheld internal of its attorneys and executives who were directly involved in negotiating the license.those showed,for example,that dupont negotiators were aware in march that the solely language in section could be a stacking restriction.see,s ection may be a problem if we use a glyphosate resistance gene as a selectable marker in soybean transformation.moreover,when dupont developed the stack in and early,those attorneys advised that dupont did not have the right to commercialize the stack b ecause of the field of use limitation in section a.see.
monsanto then moved for sanctions,seeking to invoke the district court inherent powers and asserting that dupont had misrepresented its subjective belief concerning stacking rights and had perpetrated a fraud on the court.monsanto,ecf.dupont maintained in opposition that it had always understood that the license authorized it to make and sell the stack.monsanto,ecf,at,dupont opposition brief monsanto,ecf,at,motion hearing transcript.
after a hearing,the district court granted the motion and imposed sanctions pursuant to its inherent powers on december.monsanto,ecf sealed sanctions order ecf unsealed and redacted version.the court noted that,since the beginning of the litigation,dupont had taken the position that they contracted for,and have always believed that the license provided them with,the right to stack and commercialize the rr trait with the ogat trait in soybeans,which provided the basis for dupont reformation claims.monsanto,ecf,slip op.at.the court found,however,that dupont position was not rooted in fact and that dupont had made misrepresentations,which called into question its candor to the court.id.
specifically,monsanto argued that dupont had made five types of misrepresentations in its pleadings and motions that it always had the right to commercialize or sell stacked seeds that it always had the right to stack rr and ogat traits that it believe d that section of the license agreements,the licensed field definition,ha d no relation to stacking that it did not discover the meaning of the licensed field definition and its limitation on stacking until and that it believe d that section a did not contain any type of field of use limitation.id.at.after reviewing the record and considering arguments from both parties,the court found that dupont had made factual misrepresentations concerning its subjective belief under each of the five categories as shown by its internal documents in order to support its reformation claims.id.at.the court thus held that dupont had perpetrated a fraud on the court and abused the judicial process,which warranted sanctions.id.
as sanctions,the district court struck dupont reformation defense and counterclaims.id.at.moreover,after finding that dupont had acted in bad faith,the court awarded attorney fees to monsanto,but limited the award to fees incurred in defending against dupont reformation counterclaims beginning on january,the date on which dupont moved to restore those claims,as well as fees incurred for the sanctions motions.id.at monsanto,ecf.
the parties then litigated the remaining claims.in june,the district court granted summary judgment in monsanto favor on its breach of contract claims and rejected dupont license defense,but held that the only contractual damages available to monsanto were nominal damages.monsanto,ecf.june.the patent infringement claims proceeded to trial and the jury returned a verdict for monsanto,awarding a royalty as damages for the patent infringement.monsanto,ecf.a separate trial on dupont antitrust counterclaims was scheduled for october.monsanto,ecf.in march,monsanto and dupont stipulated to dismiss all claims and counterclaims with prejudice and jointly moved for final judgment.monsanto,ecf.dupont reserved its right to appeal from the sanctions orders and rulings embodied therein,but not from other orders or rulings of the court.monsanto,ecf.the district court entered final judgment accordingly.monsanto,ecf.
dupont timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.zenith elecs.exzec,holding that dismissal of patent claims with prejudice did not divest our jurisdiction to review a district court decision regarding nonpatent claims.
discussion 
in appeals in patent cases,we apply the law of the regional circuit to which district court appeals normally lie,unless the issue pertains to or is unique to patent law.molins plc quigg.when reviewing the imposition of sanctions under a district court inherent powers,we apply the law of the regional circuit in which the district court sits,here the eighth circuit.baldwin hardware franksu enter.
the eighth circuit reviews a district court imposition of sanctions under its inherent powers for an abuse of discretion.stevenson union pac,cir citing chambers nasco,d dillon nissan motor,cir.applying eighth circuit law,we give substantial deference to the district court determination as to whether sanctions are warranted because of its familiarity with the case and counsel involved.willhite collins,cir.moreover,whether the extent of a sanction is appropriate is a question peculiarly committed to the district court.dillon,at.t he issue is not what we might have done if the situation had been presented to us originally,but rather,whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing the sanction.id.at.a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.plaintiffs baycol steering comm.bayer,cir quoting cooter gell hartmarx,d.factual findings are not clearly erroneous unless the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson city of bessemer,d.
dupont contends that interpreting the objective meaning of the license was a question of law and that the district court improperly sanctioned dupont for making reasonable legal arguments that section of the license permitted stacking and commercialization of traits.dupont also contends that the district court erred in improperly relying on selected documents to find that dupont misrepresented its subjective belief concerning stacking restrictions,whereas the full record reflected a contested factual issue.moreover,dupont contends that the views of its individual employees should not be attributed to the company.dupont also contends that the statements made by its employees in and were irrelevant to the reformation of the agreement and that those statements were merely conservative legal advice of counsel.dupont asserts that the sanctions were improper because the court ability to function impartially was not adversely affected and that the sanctions would hinder zealous advocacy.dupont also asserts that its conduct did not meet the high standard for a finding of fraud on the court.
monsanto responds that the district court did not sanction dupont for making legal arguments concerning the objective meaning of the license,but,rather,the court imposed sanctions on dupont for factual misrepresentations of its subjective belief concerning stacking rights supporting its reformation claims.monsanto contends that those representations were directly contradicted by dupont internal documents and that the court properly relied on documents that were authored by dupont attorneys and top executives who negotiated the license.moreover,monsanto argues that the court properly considered documents from and,because they shed additional light on dupont prior understanding of the agreement and whether dupont continued to maintain that understanding.monsanto also responds that dupont repeated misrepresentations and their effect on the litigation supported the court finding that dupont acted in bad faith,which warranted the attorney fees sanction.
we agree with monsanto that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions on dupont for making factual misrepresentations concerning its subjective understanding of the license in order to advance its reformation counterclaims.a district court possesses inherent powers to manage its affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.wescott agri,sterling state bank,cir quoting chambers,at.a court must exercise its inherent powers with restraint and discretion,and a primary aspect of that discretion is the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction.harlan lewis,cir.
the record is clear that the district court did not sanction dupont for making legal arguments concerning the objective meanings of the license.almost two years before imposing the sanctions,the court interpreted the license as a matter of law in the partial judgment on the pleadings,in which it concluded that the
