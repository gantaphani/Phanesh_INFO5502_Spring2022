background 
the plaintiff cuna and the defendant local were parties to a cba covering roughly cuna employees,including about who worked in a support services division providing housekeeping,cafeteria services and other maintenance services.the present case arose under this cba,which became effective april,and expired on march.the plaintiff cuna underwrites,markets and administers insurance and financial products for credit unions and their members.the defendant local,a labor union,represents roughly people employed by the plaintiff in madison,wisconsin.
article xix of the governing cba details a procedure for grievance resolution.according to article xix,all grievances had to be put in writing and had to articulate the nature of the dispute,the relief sought and the specific article and section of the agreement alleged to be violated.the procedure required several steps to be taken to resolve the grievance before it went to arbitration.if the attempts at resolution were unsuccessful,either party could appeal the grievance to arbitration.article xix,section of the cba states,t he suggested relief and the article and section cited shall be considered a formal framing of the issue or remedy if the issue is arbitrated.
the procedure for selecting an arbitrator is set out in article xix,section of the cba.this section states that the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the employer,the union and the employee s presenting the grievance.additionally,the arbitrator shall not change,but shall interpret only,the terms of this agreement.
grievance filing 
on july,cuna advised local of its intent to outsource housekeeping jobs and three other positions as a measure.local proposed alternative methods of that did not involve outsourcing work,but these were rejected.on august,local filed a grievance regarding layoffs that were impending.the grievance read,in relevant part 
the employer is implementing a layoff resulting in a reduction of the bargaining unit of up to employees without showing such reduction is necessary in accordance with article xx,section this grievance is also subject to any other contract violations determined after the investigation or grievance process begins.
the grievance did not mention any article or section of the agreement other than sections and of article xx.
on august,cuna issued layoff notices to roughly housekeeping or janitorial employees working in the support services department.cuna cited the partial outsourcing of certain housekeeping or janitorial operations to independent contractors as the reason for the layoffs.
arbitration 
local appealed the grievance to arbitration and a hearing was held on october.the arbitrator conducted a hearing and subsequently issued a written decision on february.the arbitrator identified two main issues for resolution based on the arguments of the parties whether the issue of the propriety of the company outsourcing of certain bargaining unit work in september is arbitrable and whether,if the issue is arbitrable,the company violated the parties collective bargaining agreement when it outsourced that bargaining unit work and,if so,what is the appropriate remedy.
cuna argued that the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to address any outsourcing challenge because the agreement required that a written grievance refer to the specific article and section allegedly violated the grievance in this dispute referred to sections and of article xx,which dealt exclusively with layoffs and article xx did not prohibit outsourcing and was not concerned with the underlying causes of layoffs.cuna further argued that the agreement was silent regarding the plaintiff ability to outsource work.cuna participated in the remainder of the arbitration,but did not waive its position that the arbitrator lacked the authority to rule on whether its outsourcing violated labor contract provisions not cited in the written grievance.
on february,arbitrator cohen issued a written decision on the issues.he first found that the case was properly before him.he noted that article xx requires that any lesser reduction less than fifty employees of the bargaining unit be necessary.to interpret necessary,he found that the plaintiff had to show that there was a legitimate reason to justify the layoffs.he determined that the question whether outsourcing constituted a legitimate reason to justify the layoffs is necessarily encompassed in the grievance,and thus he had authority to rule on the outsourcing issue.he then ruled on the other issues.he found that cuna layoffs violated the layoff procedure,and also that the underlying outsourcing violated several provisions of the cba.
arbitrator cohen ultimately sustained the grievance and directed,as a remedy,that the work be restored to the bargaining unit.he also directed the parties to attempt to resolve,themselves,whether employees suffered lost wages and benefits,and if so,whether and how much they should be compensated.he retained jurisdiction of this issue so that he could step in to resolve any controversy regarding implementation of the award.
of note is an earlier arbitration award of november.in that case,arbitrator herbert berman issued an arbitration award involving the same parties,in which he interpreted article xix,section,of the contract as prohibiting the resolution of an issue not expressly raised in the grievance.this decision was never brought to arbitrator cohen attention.
district court action 
in march,cuna brought an action in the western district of wisconsin to vacate the arbitration award in part.cuna lawsuit sought to vacate the portion of the award that held that the company outsourcing violates provisions of the cba.it also sought to vacate the arbitration award remedial provisions which advised the parties to privately resolve the issue of damages for affected employees.cuna did not challenge the arbitrator ruling that the layoffs implemented by cuna violated layoff procedures.the parties agreed to have the matter decided in the district court on for summary judgment.both parties filed for summary judgment and responses to for summary judgment.local also filed a motion for rule sanctions against cuna,and separate briefing was provided on this issue.
on november,the district court entered an opinion and order denying cuna motion for summary judgment and granting local motion for summary judgment and its motion for sanctions against cuna under rule.the district court awarded local attorneys fees totaling in a january,order based on the rule violation.
here,cuna appeals only the portion of the district court award that granted local motion for rule sanctions.cuna appeal of the november,opinion and order with respect to the award of rule sanctions was instituted on december.cuna appeal of the january,entry of judgment with respect to the award of rule sanctions was instituted on january.this court consolidated these appeals by order on february.
