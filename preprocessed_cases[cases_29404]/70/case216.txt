this is an appeal from the district court order granting attorneys fees and costs after the dismissal of appellant fox federal claims.fox argues that the district court erred because appellees were not prevailing parties,and because fox still maintains claims against appellees.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
fox causes of action stem from two incidents that took place in after fox and appellee vice each announced his candidacy to be police chief in the town of vinton,louisiana.the first event took place in january,when incumbent vice sent fox an anonymous letter in which vice attempted to blackmail fox into not running for office.the second event took place at a local high school basketball game in february,when a third party accused fox of uttering a racial slur and,at the instigation of vice,filed a false police report regarding fox alleged utterance.
in december,fox brought a suit in louisiana state court against vice and the town of vinton,alleging the facts and claiming federal and state causes of action.in january,the case was removed to federal court.in april,vice was tried and found guilty of extortion in state criminal court for the anonymous letter.meanwhile,discovery in the civil case produced evidence of vice participation in the filing of the false police report.in september,the defendants brought a motion for judgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment.in their motion,they argued that fox claims had no basis in federal law.in his response to the motion,fox admitted that he had failed to properly present any federal cause of action.specifically,fox stated 
defendants correctly argue that fox presents no valid claim pursuant to.as to the extortion letter,it was sent anonymously.vice did not act under color of law concerning the extortion letter.
as to the fabricated basketball game incident,fox can not show a deprivation of a right,privilege or immunity secured by the united states constitution and its laws.although vice and cary acted under color of law whenever they conspired to fabricate the basketball game incident and file a false police report,fox was not prevented from running for election.nor is the defamation fox suffered as a result of this fabrication deprivation of a property right.
in light of fox own admissions,the district court dismissed fox federal claims with prejudice and remanded the remaining claims to state court.
the defendants moved for attorneys fees pursuant to and for costs pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure arguing that fox federal claims were frivolous,unreasonable and without foundation.the district court granted that motion,and fox now appeals.

for the district court to properly award a defendant attorneys fees in a action,the court must find that the defendant is a prevailing party,and that the plaintiff claims are frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.hughes rowe stover hattiesburg pub.sch.dist an award of costs simply requires a determination that the defendant was a prevailing party 
whether appellees are prevailing parties 
we address first whether appellees are prevailing parties for purposes of and rule.see dean riser the record shows that the court granted appellees motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed fox claims with prejudice after fox conceded that he had failed to state a federal claim.all other things being equal,this makes appellees prevailing parties.see buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human sheets yamaha motors,anthony marion county hosp however,fox argues that appellees are not prevailing parties because fox voluntarily dismissed his federal claims.fox points to our decision in dean,where we held that when a plaintiff voluntarily dismisses his claims in a action,the defendant is not a prevailing party for attorneys fees purposes unless the defendant can demonstrate that the plaintiff withdrew to avoid a disfavorable judgment on the merits.
fox did not file a motion to voluntarily dismiss his federal claims before defendants responded rather,fox allowed the case to proceed for more than eighteen months in federal court and through considerable discovery before he was challenged on the legal sufficiency of his federal claims.at that point,fox was forced to concede their lack of legal merit and shifted focus to his state claims.therefore,any decision fox made to abandon his federal claims did not merely indicate his preferred forum,or a change in the law or decisive facts rather,it represented recognition that fox federal claims should never have been brought.moreover,without decisive action by appellees,fox baseless federal claims would have proceeded to trial.he chose to dismiss the federal claims because he could manufacture no argument to support them when he was challenged.to deny fees under these circumstances would defeat the purpose of ever recognizing defendants as prevailing parties,which is to protect defendants from burdensome litigation having no legal or factual basis.
we hold,therefore,that appellees are prevailing parties for purposes of rule and.
whether fox claims are frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation 
we next look to the merit of fox claims.when determining whether a claim is frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation,a district court should consider whether the plaintiff established a prima facie case,whether the defendant offered to settle,and whether the court held a full trial.myers city of west monroe in making these determinations,a court must resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that,because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail,his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation.instead,a court must ask whether the case is so lacking in arguable merit as to be groundless or without foundation rather than whether the claim was ultimately successful.
looking to the first factor,the district court correctly concluded that fox failed to establish any prima facie federal claim.contrary to fox assertions on appeal,the dismissal of fox federal constitutional claims is not based on evidentiary hurdles that he faced at the end of discovery.rather,fox claims are groundless because the offenses as alleged in his complaint have no redress in the constitution or laws of the united states the anonymous nature of vice letter to fox and the lack of harm stemming from the false police report were circumstances of which fox was aware from the outset of litigation.consequently,no evidence produced in the discovery process could change the underlying deficiencies in fox complaint.
looking to the second factor,the district court did not clearly err in finding that appellees did not engage in settlement negotiations with fox.the evidence presented by both parties shows that all the documented settlement attempts were,with fox asserting the settlement demands.no evidence points to appellees making their own settlement offers.while fox points to billing statements from appellees counsel showing charges for discussions of settlement and possible mediation with fox,these statements alone do not show clear error in the district court finding.they only show that appellees considered fox demands,not that they replied with their own.
regarding the third factor,it is undisputed that fox federal claims were all dismissed without trial.
in conclusion,all the factors establishing a frivolous case have been satisfied.accordingly,we hold the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding appellees entitled to attorneys fees.
whether appellees must prevail over the entire case to be awarded fees 
in the alternative,fox argues that even if his federal claims are meritless,appellees are not entitled to attorneys fees and costs because appellees did not prevail over the entire action.specifically,fox points to the fact that the district court remanded fox state claims that were based on the same alleged facts.
when speaking of whether a defendant is entitled to attorneys fees,the supreme court describes a suit,an action,and both a claim and an action as the proper quanta for determining frivolity,with little guidance as to which is the final determinant.there also appears to be no fifth circuit precedent on whether a defendant must prevail over an entire suit before that defendant may seek attorneys fees or whether success on an individual claim is sufficient.indeed,other circuits appear to be split on the issue 
having reviewed the other circuits holdings,we agree with the majority of circuits that a defendant does not have to prevail over an entire suit in order to recover attorneys fees for frivolous claims.we agree with the ninth and eleventh circuits that it would undermine the intent of congress to allow plaintiffs to prosecute frivolous claims without consequences merely because those claims were joined with additional claims such a rule would also make a defendant entitlement to attorneys fees depend not upon the district court review of the merits of a plaintiff claims,but upon how a plaintiff chose to draft his complaint.
however,even though a defendant need not prevail on all claims in a suit to be entitled to attorneys fees,a defendant is only entitled to attorneys fees for work which can be distinctly traced to a plaintiff frivolous claims inasmuch as a claim in the same suit can be the basis for the work of a defendant attorney,the court must consider the interrelated nature of the frivolous and claims to determine the appropriate fee we recognize that t here is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations,and much should be left to the district court equitable discretion nevertheless,we are confident that the district court will be able properly to weigh and assess the amount of attorney fees attributable exclusively to a plaintiff frivolous claim s.
in its order awarding appellees attorneys fees,the district court noted that the focus of both plaintiff and defendants was plaintiff claim.the court also noted in the second order that defendant sic request for attorney fees relates only to proceedings before this court.finally,the court noted that defendant sic do not appear to request attorney fees related to the defense of the state law claims remanded for decision to the louisiana state court.because the district court specifically restricted its award of attorneys fees to the proceedings before it,and because the court found that appellees did not seek attorneys fees for the defense of the state law claims,we do not find its award of attorneys fees an abuse of discretion.
iii.conclusion 
the district court order granting appellees attorneys fees is affirmed.
southwick,circuit judge,dissenting.
the majority has ably identified the relevant facts and discussed legal issues that arise with claims for attorneys fees.my disagreement is narrow,but it has consequence in this case.
i agree with the majority that we should affirm on the finding that the plaintiff continued too long after it became clear that there was no federal case.so some attorneys fees should be reimbursed.the district court properly stated that usually a party seeking attorneys fees must allocate the fees separately between the successful claims and the unsuccessful.that was not done here because the claims were found to be too interrelated.it is at that point that i depart from the reasoning we are affirming.
the standard quoted by the magistrate judge was taken from a precedent that applied a texas statute that allowed attorneys fees 
the district court did not require that segregate its fees into those fees incurred for successful claims and those incurred for unsuccessful claims.instead,the court found that no segregation was required because the claims arose out of the same transaction and were so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same facts.

i find the magistrate judge erred in using this standard from a debt collection statute for allowing fees to a creditor,then applying it equivalently to plaintiffs and defendants in civil rights cases.congress wanted plaintiffs of limited financial means to bring meritorious suits and recover their attorneys fees,while also permitting defendants to recover fees when the action was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless,or,even if not initially clear,the plaintiff continued to litigate the case after its frivolousness was clear.christiansburg garment eeoc.no such limitation would likely exist,nor was one mentioned,in varco or flint.
we have held that the standard for awarding attorneys fees differs if a defendant rather than a plaintiff prevails.white south park indep.sch,cir.we instead apply a more rigorous standard for awarding attorney fees to prevailing defendants.dean riser,cir citing christiansburg,at.
this demanding framework stems from congress admonition that plaintiffs in civil rights actions occupy a unique and protected role in vindicating the rights enumerated in section.see dean,at.viewing a civil rights plaintiff as a private attorney general,we do not permit awards of attorneys fees against a civil rights plaintiff absent a showing that his suit was vexatious,frivolous,or otherwise without merit.id.at.
in the debt collection precedent the magistrate judge cited,we declined to require the plaintiff to segregate the work done in support of its successful claims from its unsuccessful ones because the work on each was so interrelated as not to be divisible.varco,at.the majority here does not refer to that same caselaw,but it is the legal standard used by the magistrate judge after deciding that the legal work on the various claims could not be disentangled.as i will explain,in my view that was error and it affected the manner in which the facts were analyzed.
the varco approach is sensible when attorneys fees are being awarded to plaintiffs.a plaintiff counsel may perform legal services that support successful and unsuccessful legal theories.when it is factually impossible to allocate the services,requiring a defendant to reimburse them all will assure that a plaintiff is recovering what was necessary to bring the suit,a payment to which the plaintiff is entitled.any artificial discount because of the interrelated services may lead to less than total fee reimbursement.in such a case,the approach of the texas debt collection statute makes sense because the interests are the a plaintiff fully to recover,including attorneys fees.
on the other hand,when a defendant has successfully fended off some but not all claims as frivolous,there is still one or more claims for which the defendant has not been found to deserve any attorneys fees.the plaintiff may has not been entitled to bring those claims.so long as the plaintiff remaining claims are not found to be frivolous,no reimbursement to the defendant for the fees on those claims is permissible even if the plaintiff does not prevail.consequently,when some claims are dismissed as frivolous and others are not,allowing a defendant full recovery of his fees because the services for the various claims are too interrelated gives too much.
in summary,when work done on a plaintiff successful and unsuccessful claims is confusingly interrelated,not requiring attorneys fees awarded to be artificially segregated avoids an unfair discount.quite differently,using interrelatedness as the reason not to segregate
