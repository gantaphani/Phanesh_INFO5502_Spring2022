introduction 
plaintiff david fink appeals from an order declaring him a vexatious litigant under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b and a prefiling order issued under section.all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure unless otherwise specified.he contends the orders must be reversed because he has not suffered at least five adverse final determinations in litigation matters within the past period.
we affirm.the trial court did not err because fink has suffered an adverse final determination in at least six separate litigations that he commenced in propria persona within the immediate period preceding the trial court orders.we publish this opinion because of our analysis of the proper treatment,under section,subdivision b,of summary denials of petitions to a court of appeal for extraordinary writ relief.

fink did not submit any documentary evidence to the trial court in response to the court amended notice or provide testimony at the january,hearing on the amended notice regarding the resolution of those matters.the record does not show that fink was deprived of the opportunity to present evidence.
on january,the trial court filed an order declaring fink a vexatious litigant under section,subdivision b vexatious litigant order,stating 
on november,this court caused to be served on plaintiff david fink an amended notice of hearing to determine whether he is a vexatious litigant.the notice set a hearing on the matter for january.
on the latter date,the hearing was held.fink was present in propria persona.the court took judicial notice of the following cases,in all of which fink was and was a plaintiff petitioner,and their results

in his opposition to the notice of hearing,filed on january,fink conceded this court subsequent findings in cases numbers,and,supra.he contested the other cases.it should be noted that fink did not claim that he was not the person involved in any of the cases.it should also be noted that all of the cases were within the last seven years.
at the hearing,the court afforded fink an opportunity to present evidence and argument.fink,who did not testify,indicated that some of the dismissals which were entered at his request were the result of settlements of the cases but that he did not bring to court documentary proof of his contention.fink did not ask to continue the hearing in order to present such proof.
the court notes that in tokerud capitolbank sacramento,th,the appellate court held that a lawsuit which is ultimately dismissed by the plaintiff,with or without prejudice,can be relied upon in determining whether one is a vexatious litigant.the court also notes that in mccolm westwood park,th,the court held as follows litigation for purposes of vexatious litigant requirements encompasses civil trials and special proceedings,but it is broader than that.it includes proceedings initiated in the courts of appeal by notice of appeal or by writ petitions other than habeas corpus or other criminal matters at emphasis added.
having considered the evidence and plaintiff arguments,the court finds and declares david fink,aka david fink,a vexatious litigant pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.the court also enters a order,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,and fink is ordered to henceforth abide by this order.
the trial court signed an order entitled prefiling litigant,which stated fink is prohibited from filing any new litigation in propria persona in the courts of california without approval of the presiding judge of the court in which the action is to be filed.
fink appealed.fink submitted a motion to this court seeking our consideration of new evidence regarding two of the cases listed in the vexatious litigant order.we issued an order directing the clerk to file fink motion and stating that fink motion would be decided in conjunction with the decision on appeal.
discussion 
a court exercises its discretion in determining whether a person is a vexatious litigant.citation.we uphold the court ruling if it is supported by substantial evidence.citations.on appeal,we presume the order declaring a litigant vexatious is correct and infer findings necessary to support the judgment.citation.questions of statutory interpretation,however,we review de novo.holcomb bank nat.th.
the trial court did not err by declaring fink a vexatious litigant under section,subdivision b and issuing an order under section.vexatious litigant statutes 
section,subdivision b provides four alternative definitions of a vexatious litigant.holcomb bank nat,supra,th at.the trial court,here,found the definition in section,subdivision b applied to fink.section,subdivision b provides a vexatious litigant is one who i n the immediately preceding period has commenced,prosecuted,or maintained in propria persona at least five litigations other than in a small claims court that have been i finally determined adversely to the person or ii unjustifiably permitted to remain pending at least two years without have been brought to trial or hearing.italics added.
the term litigation is broadly defined in section,subdivision a as meaning any civil action or proceeding,commenced,maintained or pending in any state or federal court.see mccolm westwood park th.in mccolm westwood park,supra,th at page,the appellate court stated,m anifestly,any civil action or proceeding includes any appeal or writ proceeding.of course,any state or federal court includes the california court of appeal.
identifying separate litigation matters initiated by fink,the trial court declared fink a vexatious litigant and issued a prefiling order under the authority of section,subdivision a which provides in addition to any other relief provided in this title,the court may,on its own motion or the motion of any party,enter a prefiling order which prohibits a vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation in the courts of this state in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the presiding judge of the court where the litigation is proposed to be filed.disobedience of the order by a vexatious litigant may be punished as a contempt of court.
the vexatious litigant statutes are constitutional.
in his opening brief,fink challenges the constitutionality of the vexatious litigant statutes.the vexatious litigant statutes,however,have been upheld as constitutional.see in re th,neither section nor our prefiling order violates due process because as the vexatious litigant has the right to seek the permission of the presiding judge or justice to file future litigation bravo ismaj th,vexatious litigant statutes are constitutional and do not deprive a litigant of due process of law see also wolfgram wells fargo bank th,procedure set forth in section,subdivision a comports with requirements of due process.
the requirements of section,subdivision b were satisfied.first step fink concedes three qualifying litigations,and fink hollywood marble,is a fourth.
fink next challenges the orders on the ground he has not commenced,prosecuted,or maintained at least five separate litigations that were finally determined adversely to him.fink does not argue that any of the cases relied upon by the trial court fell outside the timeframe imposed by section,subdivision b or that he had not commenced,prosecuted,or maintained any of those cases in propria persona.our analysis therefore focuses on the remaining statutory criteria.in the trial court and again in his opening brief,fink conceded the first,second,and fifth cases listed in the vexatious litigant order each qualified as a litigation finally determined adversely to him.
therefore,fink concedes that three of the listed cases qualify under the statute.are there two more to meet the statutory requirement of five we begin this analysis by concluding the matter listed as the third case in the vexatious litigant order also qualified as a litigation finally determined adversely to fink within the meaning of section,subdivision b.pursuant to evidence code sections,subdivision a and,subdivision d,on our own motion,we take judicial notice of the court of appeal,second appellate district,division four unpublished opinion in that case,which is entitled fink hollywood marble.the appellate court decision in that case shows fink filed a complaint in propria persona in august.fink hollywood marble,supra.judgment was entered in fink favor against the entity defendant in march.ibid.fink,however,appealed from the judgment on the ground judgment should have also been entered against the individual defendants.ibid.the appellate court affirmed the judgment,thereby finally determining the appeal adversely to fink within the meaning of section,subdivision b.fink hollywood marble,supra.
summary denials of writ petitions do not necessarily satisfy section,subdivision b the record in this case does not sufficiently describe the summary denials to count under that statute.
having confirmed four out of the five required litigations finally determined adversely as to fink within the meaning of section,subdivision b,we next consider whether any of the seven cases in which the appellate court summarily denied a petition filed by fink the eighth,ninth,and through cases cited in the vexatious litigant order would satisfy the statute.although a writ proceeding generally qualifies as a litigation within the meaning of section,subdivision a see mccolm westwood park,supra,th at,for the reasons we next explain,we hold the summary denial of a writ petition does not necessarily constitute a litigation that has been finally determined adversely to the person within the meaning of section,subdivision b.
in leone medical board cal th,the california supreme court explained,a summary denial of a writ petition on a pretrial issue does not establish the law of the case.the supreme court distinguished writ petitions challenging pretrial superior court rulings that could also be reviewed on appeal from the judgment ultimately entered in the action from situations in which a writ petition was the only authorized mode of appellate review.id.at.as to the former type of writ petition,quoting kowis howard cal th,the supreme court stated when the court denies a writ petition without issuing an alternative writ,it does not take jurisdiction over the case it does not give the legal issue full plenary review.citation.leone medical board,supra,cal th at.a summary denial of such a writ petition therefore can not constitute a final determination of litigation within the meaning of section,subdivision b 
as to the latter type of writ petitions,discussed in leone medical board,constituting the exclusive means of obtaining appellate review,the supreme court explained,an appellate court must judge the petition on its procedural and substantive merits,and a summary denial of the petition is necessarily on the merits.citations.an appellate court that summarily denies a writ petition for lack of substantive merit or for procedural defect thereby fulfills its duty to exercise the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by the state constitution appellate jurisdiction clause.leone medical board,supra,cal th at.examples of instances in which appellate review may be obtained only through a wr
