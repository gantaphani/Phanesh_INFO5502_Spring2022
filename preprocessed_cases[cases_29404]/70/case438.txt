the united states the government appeals from an order entered in the district court for the southern district of iowa granting defendants motion to exclude certain dna evidence as a discovery sanction against the government.for reversal,the government argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding this dna evidence.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the order of the district court.
the district court had original subject matter jurisdiction over this criminal matter pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal by the government pursuant to.see united states mavrokordatos,cir holding order excluding evidence as a discovery sanction was an appealable order pursuant to.the government filed a timely notice of appeal pursuant to fed.b b.
according to the government theory of the case,on january,at about,william irwin davis,and kevin paul moyer,who were armed and wearing masks like those worn in the movie scream,entered the employee entrance of the bank of america located on army post road in des moines,iowa.davis directed a bank employee and another individual into the bank vault and told the bank employee to fill a bag with money.moyer kept two other bank employees in the main lobby.the robbers obtained about and then locked the bank employees and the other individual in the basement.they then attempted to leave but found themselves locked inside the bank.william john irvin,who had been waiting outside in a maroon chevy blazer,drove the blazer through the glass front door of the bank to enable davis and moyer to escape.they fled in the blazer and were chased by several police cars.the blazer was later found abandoned on the southside of des moines.the police apprehended them later that day on the southside of des moines.
davis,moyer and irvin hereinafter referred to collectively as defendants were initially charged in state court with robbery in the first degree.on february,a federal grand jury indicted defendants,charging them with conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery,in violation of,armed bank robbery,in violation of a,d,use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence,in violation of c,and unlawful possession of a firearm,in violation of g.on february,defendants made their initial appearance before a magistrate judge the government was required to produce.discovery materials by february.defendants were ordered detained pending trial,and the case was scheduled for trial during the criminal trial period beginning april.
on march,fbi special agent jeff atwood contacted paul bush,a criminalist with the iowa division of criminal investigation,state crime laboratory,and requested him to expedite the dna testing because the trial was scheduled to begin on april.the lab had received dna samples from defendants,two stocking caps and two scream masks on february.bush expedited the dna testing,orally reported the preliminary results to the government on march,and submitted his written report on march.the results of the dna testing were that one scream mask matched moyer,the other scream mask matched davis,the gray stocking cap matched irvin,and the black stocking cap matched both irvin and davis.
on march,the magistrate judge held a hearing on moyer motion for discovery about three other bank robberies that the government believed had been committed by defendants.in addition,irvin had written a letter to the court about proceeding pro se.the magistrate judge did not rule on irvin motion for leave to proceed pro se but did appoint counsel to advise him on the issue.the case was assigned to chief judge longstaff for trial on april.the government did not mention its request to expedite the dna testing.
on march,the district court considered irvin motion for leave to proceed pro se.after making a full record on the motion,including the possibility that irvin trial might be severed from his if he were to proceed pro se,the district court granted irvin motion for leave to proceed pro se and appointed his attorney as stand by counsel.moyer and davis then requested a severance on the ground that they would be prejudiced by going to trial with a pro se and the complication of dna evidence.the government opposed the motion for severance.the district court then inquired about the dna evidence.the government stated that a written report would be completed the next day march and that it had already orally informed defense counsel of the preliminary results just before the hearing.the district court requested the government to make the written report available to defense counsel as soon as it had been received.counsel for moyer then stated that moyer would move to exclude the dna evidence as untimely.counsel for moyer and davis indicated that they would not seek a continuance.the district court then stated that a hearing on the dna evidence would be held the next day at.the district court then granted irvin motion for leave to proceed pro se and davis and moyer motions for severance and set davis and moyer trial for april,noting that irvin trial would be rescheduled for a later date.
on march,at about,the government faxed the written dna evidence report to defense counsel and the district court.moyer filed a motion to suppress on the ground that there was no probable cause for the hair and saliva samples used in the dna testing.counsel for davis and moyer orally moved to exclude the dna evidence as untimely and rejected any continuance of the april trial date.
at the hearing,bush testified about the results of the dna testing and about the testing procedures at the state crime lab.according to the lab procedures,items like the bank robbery evidence which had been received during february were assigned on march to a particular analyst,in this case,to him.items are tested on a,basis unless there is a request for expedited testing.bush testified that on march the fbi requested that he expedite the dna testing on the bank robbery evidence because trial was scheduled to begin on april and that he had not known about the trial date.bush began testing the bank robbery items on march and,with the assistance of other staff members,completed the testing,communicated the preliminary results to the government on march,and submitted his written report on march at about bush had not begun testing earlier because of the backlog of cases at the lab.he testified that the dna testing performed in this case would ordinarily take about four days and that,if he had been requested to do so by february,he could have completed the testing by february.the government did not explain why it did not request expedited testing until march.
bush also testified that dna extracted from the scream masks and stocking caps could be used for additional dna testing,the polymerase chain reaction pcr test was used to compare the extracted dna and defendants samples,pcr is the dna test of choice in forensic testing,and there should be enough extracted dna to perform additional pcr tests.
the district court granted defendants motion to exclude the dna evidence.the district court acknowledged that the dna evidence was very convincing that defendants robbed the bank as charged in the indictment,but noted that it had a firm duty to make sure the system worked fairly and that defendants had the right to fully confront and evaluate the evidence that will be used against them in a timely fashion.the district court denied the government motion to reconsider or,in the alternative,for a continuance so defendants could review and respond to the dna evidence.the district court also advised irvin that,if he continued to represent himself,he would not be tried with davis and moyer on april and that the dna evidence would probably be admissible against him in his trial at a later date.after consulting with his counsel,irvin withdrew his motion to proceed pro se,requested that representation by counsel and acknowledged that he would be going to trial with his on april.the government immediately filed its notice of appeal.
on april,the district court further explained its reasons for granting the motion to exclude the dna evidence.the district court noted that on march the government had furnished the district court and defense counsel with the written report on the dna evidence that it planned to introduce at trial,which had been scheduled to begin on april.the day before,march,the government had informed the district court that the dna testing had been completed and that the preliminary results matched the bank robbery evidence to defendants.the district court characterized the dna evidence as critical to the government case.the district court also noted that defendants had been arrested on january,and that hair and saliva samples that had been taken from them shortly after arrest and the bank robbery evidence had been delivered to the state crime lab on february.
the district court noted that,at the arraignment on february,trial was scheduled to begin april and the government discovery deadline was february.the district court acknowledged that the state crime lab was overburdened and understaffed,but noted that bush testified that he was not notified about the april trial date and that the government had not requested expedited testing until march,a little more than a week before trial was scheduled to begin.the district court found that the government had acted with reckless disregard of the discovery deadline,noting that,if dna evidence is to be used,it must be processed in a timely fashion so as not to interfere with defendants right to a speedy trial.the district court acknowledged that,although it might appear that the untimely dna evidence could have been handled by granting a continuance,without violating defendants speedy trial rights,that solution would not have addressed the district court significant scheduling problems,which were in part due to the dramatic increase in the number of indictments in the district.the district court observed that scheduling decisions had been made for the week of april after the regularly scheduled meeting on march,at which the government had not mentioned the possibility of delay due to dna testing other criminal cases had been continued based in part on representations by the government that this case was ready to go to trial the government did not raise the possibility of delay until march and did not provide the written report on the dna evidence until march,when it was too late to reschedule previously continued criminal cases for trial during the week of april.the district court refused to condone the government production of evidence by allowing the evidence to be introduced at trial and thereby forcing the defense to seek a continuance.this interlocutory appeal followed.
for reversal,the government argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the dna evidence as a discovery sanction.the government argues that it did not act intentionally or in bad faith,defendants were not prejudiced because they did not seek a continuance in order to respond to the dna evidence and a continuance would not have violated their speedy trial rights,and a less severe sanction,such as a continuance,could have been imposed,despite the burden on the district court schedule.defendants emphasize that the district court has broad discretion in selecting the appropriate sanction for discovery violations.defendants argue that the government knew the discovery deadline was february,but failed to request expedited testing until march,offered no explanation of why it did not do so before that date,and failed to notify the district court or defense counsel about the possibility of delay due to dna testing until march,right before trial was scheduled to begin.defendants note that they had been in custody since their arrest and that the dna evidence was not only untimely but was not provided to the defense until the friday before the monday that trial was scheduled to begin.
we review the district court decision to impose sanctions and its choice of sanction for abuse of discretion.see,united states decoteau,cir.the district court has broad discretion in imposing sanctions on parties for failing to comply with discovery orders.see.d expressly providing for excluding evidence as a sanction.
in determining a suitable and effective sanction,a court must weigh the reasons for the government delay and whether it acted intentionally or in bad faith the degree of prejudice,if any,suffered by the defendant and whether any less severe sanction will remedy the prejudice and the wrongdoing of the government.
united states hastings,cir holding dismissal of indictment was too severe a sanction,cert.denied,d.t he three factors merely guide the district court and do not dictate the bounds of the district court discretion.united states russell,cir.footnote omitted discussing discovery sanctions in context for violation of reciprocal agreement to disclose witnesses prior to trial,citing united states wicker,cir noting that factors to be for delay,prejudice,and feasibility of curing prejudice with a continuance instead of excluding neither exhaustive nor dispositive,cert.denied.
we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to sanction the government for what was an obvious discovery violation.the government does not defend its failure to comply with the discovery deadline.rather,the government argues that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the severe sanction of excluding evidence rather than granting a continuance.this is a closer question,but we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the dna evidence as a discovery sanction.
reason for delay 
because the government has not given any explanation for the delay,it is difficult,if not impossible,to assess whether the government had any justification for the delay.compare united states mavrokordatos,at report of government principal witness was days late,but witness had been assigned by superiors to important duty in connection with foreign visitor and defense counsel had heard witness testify at preliminary hearing and him and had been offered opportunity to inspect discovery material referred to by witness.the district court found that the government acted with reckless disregard for the discovery deadline.the government did not seek a continuance or otherwise challenge the discovery deadline.the government was in charge of the prosecution of the case,and the orderly procurement of evidence,particularly evidence as probative as dna evidence can be,was obviously important to the presentation of its.the government could have easily complied with the discovery deadline had it made any effort to check on the status of the dna testing or the necessity for requesting expedited testing.according to the testimony of the state crime lab criminalist,had the government notified him of the discovery deadline or requested expedited testing in a timely manner,he would have assigned the case priority and would almost certainly have been able to meet the discovery deadline.
prejudice to defendants 
the district court did not make an express finding of prejudice.however,we believe that a finding of prejudice can be inferred from the district court comments and is supported by the record.the government not only produced the dna evidence a month late,but it did so almost literally on the eve of trial,making it virtually impossible,absent a continuance,for defendants to evaluate and confront the evidence against them.dna evidence is scientific and highly technical in nature it would have required thorough investigation by defense counsel,including almost certainly retaining an expert witness or witnesses.although the government discovery deadline was february,the government did not provide the preliminary dna report to the defense until march and the written dna report until march,which was the friday before the monday that trial was scheduled to begin.compare united states decoteau,at government disclosed witnesses days late but days prior to trial and listing similar cases united states maples,cir evidence was disclosed weeks after order granting disclosure but weeks before scheduled trial date.moreover,the government did not even advise the district court or de
