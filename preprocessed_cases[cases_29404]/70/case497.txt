we consider what inferences a district judge may draw,during a bench trial,in deciding a motion for judgment based on partial findings under federal rule of civil procedure c.
on december,wayne ritchie,then a deputy united states marshal,attended a christmas party at the united states post office building in san francisco.ritchie drank a bourbon and soda,and then returned to his desk.later that afternoon,with the party now in full swing,ritchie took a break to down three or four more bourbon and sodas.when he returned to his office,he began to feel paranoid and worthless.
ritchie left work early and went home.there,an unpleasant conversation with his girlfriend from new york,who complained about living in san francisco,drove him to leave the apartment in favor of the vagabond bar.he drank two more bourbon and sodas his feelings of restlessness and paranoia continued.after about half an hour,he left the bar and began walking back to his office.as he walked,ritchie hatched a plan to rob a bar so he could buy his unhappy girlfriend a plane ticket home to new york.according to ritchie,he fully expected to get caught in his paranoid state,he figured that the robbery would be an act of.
ritchie retrieved two guns from his storage locker at work and set out to put his plan into action.he decided to target the shady grove bar.once there,ritchie ordered another bourbon and soda.after finishing his drink,ritchie went up to the bartender,pulled out a gun and demanded money.a waitress came up behind him and asked ritchie what he was doing.when ritchie turned around,someone knocked him unconscious.
ritchie awoke with two officers standing over him.as a result of his attempted robbery,he resigned from the marshal office,pled guilty to attempted armed robbery,paid a fine and was sentenced to five years probation.obviously,these were the days before sentencing guidelines.
fast forward years.in,ritchie read the newspaper obituary of sidney gottlieb,a doctor at the central intelligence agency.see obituary,gottlieb,directed tests,san jose mercury news,at.from this article,ritchie learned that the cia had been administering lsd to unwitting subjects in the as part of a cold war project to study its effects see generally kronisch united states,cir describing the cia project.based on this article,as well as his own independent research into the cia drugging activity,ritchie concluded that the cia had drugged him as part of a experiment.ritchie brought a timely suit under the federal tort claims act ftca,against the united states and its agents,claiming that his attempted robbery was set in motion when someone surreptitiously slipped lsd into his drinks at the christmas party.
after denying the government motion to dismiss,ritchie united states,d,and for summary judgment,the district court held a bench trial.ritchie presented two live witnesses during his himself and a doctor who testified that lsd was the cause of ritchie attempted robbery of the shady grove.ritchie also relied heavily on the deposition testimony of ira ike feldman,a former agent involved with both the federal bureau of narcotics and the cia surreptitious project,who made a series of incriminating contradictory and combative statements about his role in the cia lsd project.
at the close of ritchie case,the government moved for judgment as a matter of law,which the district court construed as a motion under federal rule of civil procedure c for judgment based on partial findings in a bench trial.the district court granted the government motion,finding that ritchie had not proven that he was administered lsd by an agent of the federal government,or by anyone else,on december,and ritchie had therefore failed to prove that an psychotic disorder caused his attempted robbery of the shady grove.the district court rejected ritchie arguments that he was entitled to a favorable evidentiary inference because the government destroyed files related to the cia drugging activity and that he should be granted preclusive sanctions based on government misconduct during feldman depositions.instead,the district court awarded ritchie reasonable costs and attorneys fees incurred in taking feldman second deposition.
jurisdiction 
the government argues that we lack jurisdiction over ritchie appeal because the district court has yet to fix the amount of its monetary sanctions award and the judgment below is therefore not final.see kennedy applause,cir jensen moore,caldwell,rowland dodd,cir.but ritchie has expressly waived his right to monetary sanctions based on the government misconduct during feldman depositions,leaving nothing for the district court to decide.we have jurisdiction.see.
discussion 
ritchie argues that in ruling on a motion for judgment based on partial findings,see.c,the district court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.according to ritchie,the standard for entering judgment on partial findings during a bench trial under rule c is the same as for entering judgment as a matter of law during a jury trial under federal rule of civil procedure a.
rules a and c,however,assign very different functions to the district judge.rule a provides that once a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial,the court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against the party only if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.the rationale is obvious during a jury trial,the the the trier of fact.because the district judge lacks the authority to resolve disputed issues of fact under those circumstances,judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if no reasonable jury could find for a party on that claim.this necessarily means that the court must draw all reasonable evidentiary inferences in favor of the party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d o n summary judgment the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.ellipsis in original quoting united states diebold,d internal quotation marks omitted.when the jury is the trier of fact,judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if no reasonable jury could find in favor of the party.see id.
by contrast,a motion for judgment on partial findings under rule c may be made only during a bench trial.under rule c,the court may enter judgment as a matter of law with respect to a claim or defense that can not under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.c.rule c expressly authorizes the district judge to resolve disputed issues of fact.see.a findings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.in deciding whether to enter judgment on partial findings under rule c,the district court is not required to draw any inferences in favor of the party rather,the district court may make findings in accordance with its own view of the evidence 
although ritchie behavior on december,may have been consistent with an psychotic episode,the district court reasonably found that there are other plausible explanations for the symptoms that ritchie described,including mild intoxication or some undiagnosed organic condition.the court concluded that it was likely that ritchie behavior was caused by some organic factor,either alone or in combination with a modest degree of alcohol intoxication.it is also possible that ritchie apparent lapse of judgment was exactly what it appears to be.although the court acknowledged that ritchie behavior may well have been consistent with an psychotic episode,the court noted that t o take this inference to its logical conclusion would compel the court to find that lsd intoxication is the likely cause of almost any unexplained and superficially inexplicable behavior.the district court finding that ritchie did not carry his burden of proof is supported by the record.
although feldman made a number of comments in his depositions suggesting that he was involved in drugging ritchie,the district court determination that ritchie did not prove feldman involvement is not clear
