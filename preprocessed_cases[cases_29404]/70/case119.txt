pursuant to this court local rule,it is hereby ordered,adjudged,and decreed that paul warburgh is publicly reprimanded for the misconduct described in the appended report of this court committee on admissions and grievances the committee,and leave to resign from the bar of this court is granted.
summary of proceedings 
by order filed in september,this court referred warburgh to the committee for investigation of the matters described in that order and preparation of a report on whether he should be subject to disciplinary or other corrective measures.in march,the committee ordered warburgh to show cause why the committee should not recommend to the court that disciplinary or other corrective action be taken against him the order.although warburgh requested,and received,multiple extensions of time to respond to the committee order,he failed to do so.see report at.moreover,each of his extension requests was made after the relevant deadline had passed,and he failed to respond to a number of other committee communications.id.one of those committee communications explicitly advised warburgh that the committee would proceed with the matter even in the absence of a response and that his failure to respond may constitute an independent basis of professional misconduct subjecting him to disciplinary action,quoting committee letter dated june.
due to warburgh default,the committee determined that it would take summary action and proceed without a hearing pursuant to rule d of the committee rules.thereafter,the committee filed with the court the record of the committee proceedings and its report and recommendations.
in its report,the committee concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that warburgh had engaged in conduct warranting the imposition of discipline.see report at.specifically,the committee found that warburgh had failed to comply with this court scheduling orders,failed to respond to this court inquiries,and failed to communicate with his clients.id.at,discussing united states bazuaye,united states martinez,united states delvi cordero,united states vasquez julio de la cruz.the committee further found that warburgh failure to cooperate with the instant investigation constituted both an independent basis for discipline and an aggravating factor.id.at.
after identifying several aggravating factors,the committee stated that,due to warburgh failure to respond to the disciplinary charges,it was unaware of any specific mitigating factors.id.at.the committee nonetheless took into account certain evidence found in this court records relating to warburgh medical problems as well as his asserted intention to retire id.at.in light of warburgh long career,medical issues,and professed intention to retire,the committee stop ped short of recommending removal from the bar of this court.id.at.instead,the committee recommended that warburgh be privately reprimanded,permitted to withdraw from the bar of this court,and precluded from readmission.id.the committee also recommended,however,that warburgh be involuntarily disbarred if he declined to withdraw.id.
in september,warburgh submitted a email in response to the committee report.warburgh stated that he had no comment on the bazuaye matter,but then asserted that there had been a substantial period of time he could not communicate with bazuaye and that it appeared that bazuaye had been deported disputed that he had failed to communicate with his client in the delacruz matter,stating that de la cruz calls were answered if warburgh was available,that delacruz received copies of all documents or his family had the opportunity to receive them,and that everything was timely filed and argued and affirmed asserted that the appeal in cordero was erroneously dismissed and stated that he had no comment concerning martinez,email.in conclusion,warburgh stated that he is now retired and he formally withdr e w from the second circuit bar.id.however,since an attorney who is the subject of a disciplinary proceeding in this court may resign from the court bar only upon obtaining leave of the court,in re saghir,cir,we construe warburgh statement as requesting leave to resign.
ii.failure to respond to committee order 
summary action by the committee.
we agree with the committee that an attorney failure to respond to the committee order will usually permit the committee to take summary action.see rule d,rules of committee on admissions and grievances cir.in the event the attorney does not respond to the order to show cause,or otherwise waives his or her right to appear at a hearing,or the committee finds that oral testimony or argument is not required,the committee may take summary action.while there may be circumstances where an attorney default might not justify summary,where the facts underlying the default are themselves disputed,or where other charges of misconduct can not be resolved through summary such circumstances are evident in the present case.
additionally,where,as here,the charged attorney has not challenged the committee decision to take summary action,any issue relating to the propriety of summary action can be treated as waived,unless a waiver would not be in the interests of justice.for example,a waiver would not relieve the committee or court of the obligation to base a finding of misconduct on clear and convincing evidence.see rule h,rules of committee on admissions and grievances cir.we conclude that the committee properly took summary action and that,in any event,warburgh has waived any challenge to that decision.
treating default as both independent basis for disciplinary action and aggravating factor.
the committee also properly treated warburgh default as both an independent basis for disciplinary action and an aggravating factor.see american bar association,standards for imposing lawyer sanctions e,amended see,in re padilla,finding that attorney obstructionism in disciplinary proceeding frustrated the diligent pursuit of serious charges against him,placed into question his fitness to represent others,and itself constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.
however,we find that a private reprimand is not an adequate disciplinary measure when the attorney knowingly defaulted and failed to show good cause or excusable neglect for the default.an attorney default in disciplinary proceedings is a serious breach of the attorney professional obligations to the court and the public.in such a case,the attorney has not only failed to respond to a order,but has done so after the court already has found good cause to question the attorney very competence to continue practicing in this court.furthermore,such defaults often seriously handicap the committee and court in their efforts to reach a fair determination based on a complete record,and usually result in waste of committee and court resources.
thus,in most cases,when an attorney knowingly defaults in a disciplinary proceeding,and fails to show good cause or excusable neglect for the default,the resulting disciplinary measure,for that misconduct alone,should be no less than a public reprimand.that general rule applies here.warburgh defaulted a number of times during the committee proceedings,never submitted a response to the committee order,failed to make a showing of good cause or excusable neglect for those defaults,compromised the committee ability to make a reasoned recommendation based on a full examination of all relevant facts,and wasted the committee time and resources.although the committee noted that warburgh prior medical problems might constitute a mitigating circumstance with regard to the underlying allegations of misconduct,warburgh has not asserted,and there is no indication,that those medical problems affected his ability to respond to the committee order.in these circumstances,we conclude that a public reprimand is more appropriate than the private reprimand recommended by the committee 
waiver of right to challenge commit tee report.
we also conclude that an attorney unexcused failure to respond to the committee order,or other material default during the committee proceedings,may constitute a waiver of the attorney right to thereafter challenge in this court matters encompassed by the order or other portions of the committee proceedings affected by the default.in re amato,dep t deeming disciplinary charges admitted as a result of default in re filippone,a,dep t same in re viscomi,dep t same in re burgess,dep t same.
in thomas am,the supreme court held that a court of appeals may adopt a rule conditioning appeal,when taken from a district court judgment that adopts a magistrate recommendation,upon the filing of objections with the district court identifying those issues on which further review is desired.this court has adopted such a rule.see united states male juvenile,cir we have adopted the rule that failure to object timely to a magistrate judge report may operate as a waiver of any further judicial review of the decision,as long as the parties receive clear notice of the consequences of their failure to object.the supreme court found that such a rule was encompassed by the supervisory power of the courts of appeals to promulgate procedural rules governing the management of litigation,thomas,at,and was supported by sound considerations of judicial economy,id.at.
the filing of objections to a magistrate report enables the district judge to focus attention on those and are at the heart of the parties dispute.the court of appeals rule,by precluding appellate review of any issue not contained in objections,prevents a litigant from sandbagging the district judge by failing to object and then appealing.absent such a rule,any issue before the magistrate would be a proper subject for appellate review.this would either force the court of appeals to consider claims that were never reviewed by the district court,or force the district court to review every issue in every case,no matter how thorough the magistrate analysis and even if both parties were satisfied with the magistrate report.either result would be an inefficient use of judicial resources.in short,t he same rationale that prevents a party from raising an issue before a circuit court of appeals that was not raised before the district court applies here.
id.at quoting united states schronce,cir.however,the supreme court also emphasized that,since the waiver rule was nonjurisdictional,the courts of appeals may excuse defaults in the interests of justice.id.at.
the considerations noted in thomas that justify limiting an appeal to those issues raised in properly filed objections to a magistrate judge report also apply to an attorney challenge in this court to a report of the committee on admissions and grievances.we add the following comments specific to the utility of a waiver rule when an attorney defaults before the committee.
in the present case,warburgh clearly had an opportunity to address before the committee all matters discussed in the committee order and this court september referral order,including bazuaye,de la cruz and cordero.permitting him to address those matters for the first time at this late date,without a showing of good cause or excusable neglect for his default before the committee,not only would encourage future defaults by attorneys in disciplinary proceedings but would leave this court with a seriously defective record.
when an attorney fails to cooperate with the committee investigation,the committee may be unable to evaluate all available pertinent evidence including the attorney own testimony and other evidence or witnesses whose identity or location might be known only to the attorney,or to test the attorney version of events through and discovery.additionally,while testimony may,when necessary,be presented remotely by telephone or other electronic means,the attorney failure to appear at a hearing also may deprive the committee of the ability to reach conclusions based on the attorney demeanor.thus,permitting the attorney to challenge the allegations underlying the committee order only after the committee has submitted its report would constitute a serious disruption and distortion of the disciplinary process.the distortion of the process is particularly acute when,as here,the attorney asks this court to consider unsworn factual assertions that have not been subject to.
an attorney default during committee proceedings also wastes the court and committee limited resources,and introduces an unnecessary element of uncertainty into the proceedings.the problem is similar to that discussed in thomas.permitting defenses and issues to be raised for the first time after the committee report has been filed with the court would require the court either to decide issues that were never analyzed by the very body charged with performing such an analysis in the first to remand the matter to the committee for further proceedings.alternatively,the committee may feel the need to consider all possible defenses and issues despite the those the charged attorney has no intention of avoid leaving this court without a recommendation on an issue later presented by the attorney.see thomas,at.as in thomas,e ither result would be an inefficient use of judicial resources.id.
the committee volunteer members have dedicated numerous uncompensated hours and other resources to this and every other referred case.yet warburgh essentially asks this court to ignore the committee and this court efforts up to this point and start from scratch based on his conclusory assertions in his response to the committee report.in the absence of a showing of good cause or excusable neglect,or that the interests of justice would be served by excusing the default,such a request is unreasonable.
on the other hand,warburgh was not warned by this court or the committee that failure to timely respond to the committee order may constitute a waiver of any future challenge to any matter encompassed by that order.see thomas,at finding waiver rule to be valid exercise of supervisory power at least when it incorporates clear notice to the litigants and an opportunity to seek an extension of time for filing objections male juvenile,at.although the committee did warn warburgh that his failure to respond may constitute an independent basis of professional misconduct subjecting him to disciplinary action,committee letter dated june,that warning was not broad enough to put him on notice of the possibility of waiver.see small sec y,health human services,cir discussing specificity required of warning that failure to object to magistrate judge report will waive appellate review.thus,we will not apply the waiver principle to the present case.however,in future disciplinary proceedings,we request that the committee include in its orders requiring a response from the charged attorney language to the following effect 
your failure to timely respond to,and comply with,this order may a constitute a waiver of the right to challenge,in future committee and court proceedings,any matter encompassed by this order,and b result in disciplinary measures,including suspension or disbarment.see in re warburgh,cir.
however,the committee may adapt the warning language as necessary to suit particular circumstances,to ensure that the charged attorney is on notice of the consequences of default in committee proceedings 
we do not,in any respect,fault the committee for the procedures it followed in this case,which were fully appropriate.we had not previously suggested that the waiver rule discussed in thomas arn might be applicable to disciplinary proceedings and,thus,the committee had no reason to warn warburgh of the possibility of waiver.the waiver rule that we now institute is intended as an aid to the committee,to decrease the number of defaults by charged attorneys,enabling the committee to focus more of its resources on the substantive analysis of the merits of cases rather than chasing after uncooperative attorneys.the committee has been indispensable to this court,and we wish only to ameliorate one of the more frustrating aspects of the disciplinary process.
iii.issues raised by response and additional relevant conduct 
although we do not deem warburgh present challenges to the committee report to be waived as a result of his default before the committee,we nonetheless find them meritless for the following reasons.for present purposes,we assume that warburgh factual assertions are properly before us despite the fact that they were not made under penalty of perjury and were not subject to by the committee.
conduct in martinez.as a preliminary matter,since warburgh response to the committee report only addresses his conduct in bazuaye,de la cruz and cordero,we find that he has waived any objection to the committee findings concerning martinez.since those findings are supported by the record,we adopt them.
conduct in bazuaye.warburgh assertions that he had been unable to communicate with bazuaye for a substantial period of time,and that bazuaye appeared to have been deported,have little relevance to the allegations that were made about his conduct in bazuaye appeal.according to the september referral order a warburgh failed to obey the court order directing him to file a motion to withdraw as counsel b warburgh failure to file a brief caused the appeal to be dismissed on default and c the court was informed by bazuaye that warburgh had failed to comply with bazuaye instruction that he withdraw as counsel,and failed to accept his telephone calls or return messages.see order at.although warburgh assertion that he had been unable to communicate with bazuaye for a period of time might be relevant to bazuaye complaint about messages not being returned,the remaining allegations are far more serious,are not addressed by warburgh,and are amply supported by the court records for that appeal.
conduct in de la cruz.two of the cases discussed in the referral order and committee report bear the name de la cruz,and warburgh does not make clear whether he was referring to the case docketed under or.in either event,we reject his assertions that de la cruz calls were answered if warburgh was available,that delacruz received copies of all documents or his family had the opportunity to receive them,and that everything was timely filed and argued and affirmed.
to the extent warburgh was referencing,he appears to be disputing de la cruz allegation that warburgh had refused to communicate with him,and the statements in the september order and the committee report that warburgh had failed to file a brief by the deadline set in this court order,and that his default caused the dismissal of the appeal.see order at report at.however,warburgh does not address the allegations that he repeatedly threatened de la cruz mother with withdrawal from the case if she did not pay him more money,and that he failed to comply with the court instruction that he provide the court with a copy of his response to de la cruz complaint about his conduct.see order at.
contrary to warburgh assertion,the docket clearly reflects that warburgh failed to comply with this court instructions and orders,causing the case to be dismissed on default.see de la cruz,letters docketed,and may,requiring response to court order docketed,requiring warburgh to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed based on his default order docketed,dismissing appeal based on warburgh default.additionally,the assertion that de la cruz calls were answered if warburgh was available is virtually meaningless since warburgh did not address the specific allegations made by his client and did not explain what was done with de la cruz calls when warburgh was not available.
to the extent warburgh was referencing,his comments appear irrelevant since the allegations about that case in the referral order concerned the district court proceedings,not the appeal.in any event,the committee found insufficient evidence of misconduct in that appeal.see report at.
conduct in cordero.warburgh assertion that the appeal in cordero was erroneously dismissed simply agrees with the committee conclusion about that dismissal,see report at,and warburgh fails to address the committee findings that he had failed to respond to the court inquiries,and that he appeared to have made no effort to have the appeal reinstated after its improper dismissal,id.at.since the docket supports the committee findings,we adopt them.
recent conduct.according to his own filings in this court,warburgh has been in the process of retiring for at least two years.see united states moran grullon,motion filed,stating that warburgh is retiring and no longer has an office or the support staff to do an appeal.in at least two cases during that time period,he filed appeals and then successfully moved to be relieved based on his retirement,order filed,granting motion to be relieved as counsel united states yen,motion filed,i am now retired and this case was one of my last,order filed,granting motion to be relieved as counsel.
warburgh most recent case in this court was united states medina,an appeal he filed on august.although warburgh indicated,in september,that he intended to move for appointment of new counsel in that case,see medina,form b filed,and presumably to be relieved,he did not do so until he was instructed by the clerk office,in late november,to file either a status update letter or a scheduling notification,id.at,docket entry noting telephone call.his december motion to be relieved as counsel,based on his retirement,was granted and new counsel substituted,motion filed,order filed.we note that the attorney registration web site for the new york state unified court system does not indicate that warburgh has retired.
iv.voluntary withdrawal from this court bar 
we will not allow an attorney to evade our disciplinary authority through strategic withdrawal after disciplinary proceedings have commenced.saghir,at.thus,an attorney who is the subject of a disciplinary proceeding in this court may not resign from the court bar without first obtaining leave of the court.id.we have previously declined to accept an attorney resignation where doing so may mislead others into believing that the attorney separation from this court bar was entirely voluntary.see in re jaffe,cir.
warburgh has not explicitly set forth any basis upon which we can conclude that allowing his voluntary withdrawal would be in the interests of justice.see in re yan wang.lexis cir.july,discussing several factors supporting decision to grant leave to withdraw from court bar during the pendency of disciplinary proceedings.in fact,several of the factors discussed in yan wang would justify denial of leave to withdraw in this case.however,warburgh professed intention to retire from the practice of law suggests that his request for withdrawal is not made solely for the purpose of evading a disciplinary sanction,the misconduct discussed in the committee report was not as egregious as that involved in jaffe and saghir,and the fact that this opinion will be made public makes it unlikely that the public will be misled as to the circumstances of his withdrawal.accordingly,we grant warburgh leave to withdraw from this court bar.
conclusions 
upon due consideration of the committee report,the underlying record,and warburgh submissions,it is hereby ordered that warburgh is publicly reprimanded for the misconduct discussed in the committee report,and his request for leave to withdraw from this court bar is granted.
the text of this panel september order and the committee report are appended to,and deemed part of,the present order for the following disclosure purposes.warburgh must disclose this order to all clients in cases currently pending in this court and to all courts and bars of which he is currently a member,and as required by any bar or court rule or order.warburgh also must,within fourteen days of the filing of this order,file an affidavit with this court confirming that he has complied with the preceding disclosure requirement.furthermore,the clerk of court is directed to release this order to the public by posting it on this court web site and providing copies to members of the public in the same manner as all other published decisions of this court,and to serve a copy on warburgh,this court committee on admissions and grievances,the attorney disciplinary committee for the new york state appellate division,first department,and all other courts and jurisdictions to which this court distributes disciplinary decisions in the ordinary course 
text of september order 
for the reasons that follow,paul warburgh is referred to this court committee on admissions and grievances for investigation of the matters described below and preparation of a report on whether he should be subject to disciplinary or other corrective measures.see second circuit local rule h now local rule.we express no opinion here as to an appropriate disposition.the committee may,of course,in the first instance,determine the appropriate scope of its investigation.
warburgh was referred to this grievance panel as a result of the proceedings in united states bazuaye.this court records in that appeal reflect that,after filing the notice of appeal,warburgh did not file any other document despite remaining counsel of record for the appellant.in november,this court issued its first scheduling order in the appeal,establishing a december deadline for the appellant brief.see bazuaye,order filed.in december,prior to the deadline for the appellant brief,this court received a copy of a letter from the appellant,addressed to warburgh,reminding warburgh to inform this court that the appellant had asked warburgh to withdraw,letter filed.in march,june,and august,the clerk office called warburgh to request the filing of either a motion to withdraw as counsel or a motion for an extension of time to file a brief,docket entries for,june,and.in november,this court dismissed bazuaye appeal for failure to comply with the scheduling order,order filed.
shortly thereafter,bazuaye filed a pro se motion for reinstatement of his appeal and appointment of counsel,motion filed.bazuaye stated that,in december,he had asked warburgh to withdraw as counsel and that,in the year preceding bazuaye november motion,warburgh had refused to accept bazuaye calls or return messages left by two social services workers from bazuaye place of incarceration.id.as a result of bazuaye motion,this court reinstated the appeal,ordered warburgh to file,within days,a motion to withdraw as counsel in compliance with second circuit local rule b,and referred warburgh apparent dereliction in th e case to the court grievance committee,order filed.the deadline for the motion to withdraw expired on monday,march,without warburgh either filing a motion to withdraw or responding to the february order in any other way.in may,this court sua sponte relieved warburgh and ordered the appointment of new counsel,order filed may.
we also request that the committee examine the proceedings in several other appeals in this court in which warburgh was counsel of record for the appellants.in united states martinez,warburgh,on behalf of the appellant,requested an extension of time to file his brief and was given until december,to do so.see martinez,order filed.more than three months after the brief was due,the clerk office left a message for warburgh about the overdue brief and,a month later,dismissed the appeal for failure to comply with the scheduling order.see,entry dated,and order filed.in a separate letter written at the direction of judge walker,warburgh was reminded of his obligation under second circuit local rule b a to continue representing the appellant until relieved by the court,and was directed to file,within days,either a brief and appendix or a stipulation withdrawing the appeal signed by his client,himself,and opposing counsel,letter filed.the letter also required him to,inter alia,explain his conduct in the appeal and warned that failure to comply would result in sua sponte dismissal of warburgh as attorney of record and issuance of an order to show cause why he should not be disciplined.id.
the deadline for a response to the april letter expired on may,without the response or any other document being filed by the appellant or warburgh.on june,the court sua sponte reinstated the appeal,relieved warburgh as counsel,and ordered that new counsel be appointed,order filed june.shortly thereafter,however,warburgh responded to the april letter by requesting an extension of time to file an anders brief,which accompanied the motion,motion and other documents filed or received june.in the motion for an extension.warburgh explained that various serious medical problems in february,march and possibly april had rendered him unable to work for part of that.id.however,warburgh did not explain why he was unable to either meet the december deadline for filing the appellant brief or cure his default prior to the onset of his illnesses in february.id.this court granted the extension,which implicitly reinstated warburgh as counsel and permitted the anders papers to be filed,order and other documents filed june and.the anders motion,and the government motion for summary affirmance,were later granted,orders filed.
in united states vasquez de la cruz,after this court remanded the case for possible resentencing,warburgh client,de la cruz,requested that this court appoint new counsel for the resentencing,based on warburgh alleged refusal to return his calls or provide him with copies of documents relevant to his case,including this court decisions.see vasquez de la cruz,motion filed july.among other things,de la cruz stated that he had filed a complaint with the new york state bar association.id.at and exh.
in united states delvi cordero,this court dismissed the appeal of angel cordero,warburgh client,based on the belief that warburgh had failed to file a brief even after the clerk office had called warburgh twice regarding his apparent default.see delvi cordero,docket entries for,and.however,upon reviewing the court file for delvi cordero for purposes of the present proceeding,references to a filed brief were discovered.one of those references was in a letter from cordero to the court complaining of certain arguments warburgh had made in the appellate brief and of warburgh failure to send cordero a copy of the brief despite numerous requests for it by cordero.see,cordero letter filed may.further investigation led to an entry for cordero brief in the docket sheet for a appeal.see united states delvi martinez,entry.the filing date of that it is,in fact,the correct in compliance with the scheduling order entered in the appeal docketed under see,order filed.while it appears that warburgh may not have defaulted on the briefing schedule,and thus dismissal may have been inappropriate,there is no indication that warburgh attempted to correct the error,despite being contacted on several occasions concerning the allegedly late brief.
most recently,in united states vasquez julio de la cruz,warburgh client filed a pro se notice of appeal and informed this court in two letters that his counsel,apparently referring to warburgh,will not be representing him on appeal,refused to communicate with him,and repeatedly threatened his mother with withdrawal from the case if she did not pay him more money,despite accepting the case with knowledge that the mother had paid with her life savings and had no other money.see vasquez julio de la cruz,letters filed,and may.the clerk office forwarded the two letters to warburgh with a cover letter which instructed him to supply the court with a copy of his response.see id.although the scheduling order in the case required the appellant brief to be filed by may,see,order filed,warburgh has yet to file a brief,a motion to withdraw as counsel in compliance with second circuit local rule b,or any other document in the case.see also,pro se letter of appellant filed july,requesting new counsel,and alleging that warburgh had failed to inform him of court rulings and otherwise rendered ineffective assistance.
upon due consideration of the matters described above,it is ordered that paul warburgh is referred to this court committee on admissions and grievances for investigation and preparation of a report consistent with federal rule of appellate procedure,this court local rule h,and the rules of the committee on admissions and grievances.

by order dated september,the united states court of appeals for the second circuit the court referred paul warburgh to this committee for investigation of his conduct before the court and for preparation of a report on whether he should be subject to discipline or other corrective measures.the committee issued an order to show cause why it should not recommend discipline other corrective action against warburgh based on the allegations in the court order.
warburgh has defaulted.therefore,the committee may take summary action.see local h committee rule d.the following constitutes the committee report and recommendation to impose discipline on warburgh.
ii.the referral order 
the court referred warburgh to the committee by order dated september,the referral order.the referral order addresses five separate matters pending before the court in in which warburgh was listed as counsel of record united states bazuaye,united states martinez,united states vasquez de la cruz,united states delvi cordero,united states delvi martinez,and united states vasquez julio de lacruz.many of the facts in this report and recommendation are taken directly from the referral order.
each matter involves neglect of files,failure to abide by the court rules,failure to respond to the court inquiries.
iii.this disciplinary proceeding 
on march,this committee issued an order to show cause regarding warburgh conduct as alleged in the referral order.the letter was returned because warburgh had changed addresses.the committee located his new office address and sent him a new order to show cause on march.warburgh response was due within thirty days.
by letter dated april,after the deadline for response had passed,warburgh requested an extension of time to respond to the order to show cause.he indicated that he would be able to respond by july.by letter of may,the committee extended his time to respond until may.
on may,warburgh contacted the then secretary for the committee,amin kassam,by telephone and requested an additional extension.kassam instructed warburgh to put his request and the reasons for the request in a letter to the committee.warburgh did not do so.
on june,the committee sent another letter to warburgh,instructing him that if he did not respond by june,the committee would proceed without the benefit of his response.the letter also advised that his failure to respond may constitute an independent basis for finding professional misconduct subjecting him to disciplinary action.
in,terrence connors,a member of this committee,called warburgh at his last known telephone number.connors left a voicemail message but warburgh did not return the call.this committee secretary,shanya dingle,also has left two phone messages for warburgh that have gone unreturned.
despite the multiple extensions of time,multiple communications from this committee,and the passage of over eight months since he was first served with the order to show cause,to this date warburgh has not submitted a response to the order to show cause.
iv.factual background 
because warburgh has not submitted a response,the following allegations are uncontested.
united states bazuaye,
warburgh was counsel for in this matter.on november,the court entered a scheduling order making appellant brief due on december.on december,the court received a letter written by warburgh client to warburgh reminding warburgh to inform the court that his client had asked warburgh to withdraw as counsel.
on march,june,and august,the clerk office called warburgh to request that he either file a motion to withdraw as counsel or file a motion for an extension of time to file the brief which was past due.on november,the court dismissed the appeal for failure to comply with the scheduling order.
on november,appellant moved pro se to reinstate his appeal.in his motion,appellant stated that he had asked warburgh to withdraw as counsel in december and that warburgh had refused to accept his calls or return messages left by workers at bazuaye place of incarceration.on february,the court granted the pro se motion and ordered that warburgh file a motion to withdraw as counsel within thirty days.
warburgh did not move to withdraw.on may,the court relieved warburgh as counsel and ordered new counsel appointed.according to the docket,appellant new counsel briefed the appeal and the judgment was affirmed.
united states martinez,
warburgh was appointed counsel under the criminal justice act on november.warburgh requested and was granted an extension of time to file appellant brief.the brief was due on december.
on march,the clerk office left a message for warburgh about his overdue brief.on april,the appeal was dismissed for failure to comply with the scheduling order.the same day,the court sent a letter to warburgh reminding him of his obligation under second circuit local rule b a to continue representing the appellant until relieved by the court and directing warburgh to file,within twenty days,either a brief and appendix or a stipulation withdrawing the appeal signed by his client,himself,and opposing counsel.the letter also required him to explain his conduct and warned that failure to comply would result in a sua sponte dismissal of warburgh as attorney of record and issuance of an order to show cause why he should not be disciplined.warburgh did not respond.
on june,the court reinstated the appeal,relieved warburgh as counsel,and ordered that new counsel be appointed.on june,warburgh filed an appendix,a motion for an extension of time to file a brief,and an anders brief.in his affirmation in support of his motion for an extension,warburgh explained that he had been experiencing severe medical issues 
in february of this year,i became ill with bilateral pneumonia and i was not working for several weeks and then resumed working.around the of march,i had extensive surgery for basal cell carcinoma and as i was recovering from this i was diagnosed with malignant melanoma which required immediate surgery.this surgery required an incision and sutures.about a month later i had more surgery for squamous cell carcinoma and another surgery for basal cell carcinoma.i am now getting back to work at the office and have completed an anders brief in this case.unfortunately,my latest illnesses and surgeries have made it difficult to work.therefore,i respectfully request leave to file the completed brief and appendix in this case at a later date.
warburgh affirmation did not address why he was unable to comply with the original deadline of december,or why he did not cure his failure to comply in the two months before he alleges that he became ill.the court granted the extension and ultimately granted the anders motion.
united states vasquez de lacruz,
warburgh timely filed appellant brief on may.on june,the court remanded the matter to the district court for further proceedings in the aftermath of united states booker.on july,warburgh client requested that the court appoint new counsel,alleging that warburgh refused to return his calls or provide him with copies of documents.the client also stated that he had filed a complaint with the new york state bar association.
united states delvi cordero,
on january,the court dismissed this appeal based on the belief that warburgh had failed to file a brief even after the clerk office had called him twice regarding the default.according to the court records,it is possible that the brief actually was filed and the dismissal was in error.regardless,there is no evidence that warburgh made any efforts to have the appeal reinstated.
on june,the court reinstated the appeal.according to the docket,warburgh subsequently continued to participate in this matter.the judgment was affirmed on april.
united states vasquez julio de la cruz,
on march,the court issued a scheduling order requiring the record on appeal to be filed by april,and appellant brief to be filed by may.on april and may,the court received letters from warburgh client stating that warburgh refused to communicate with him and repeatedly threatened his mother with withdrawal from the matter if she did not pay him even though sh
