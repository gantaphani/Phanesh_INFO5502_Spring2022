introduction 
years ago,the legislature enacted the civil discovery act of code civ,et the act,a comprehensive revision of pretrial discovery statutes,the central precept of which is that civil discovery be essentially.more than years ago,townsend superior court th,d townsend lamented the all too often interjection of ego and emotions of counsel and clients into discovery disputes,warning that l ike hotspur on the field of battle,counsel can become blinded by the combative nature of the proceeding and be rendered incapable of informally resolving a disagreement.id.at.townsend counseled that the informal resolution of discovery disputes entails something more than bickering with opposing counsel.id.at,d.rather,the statute requires that there be a serious effort at negotiation and informal resolution.id.at,d.
this case illustrates once again the truth of townsend observations,as well as highlighting the lengths to which some counsel and clients will go to avoid providing discovery in this case by responding to straightforward interrogatories with nitpicking and meritless objections,resulting in delaying proceedings,impeding the operation of discovery,and wasting the time of the court,the discovery referee,the opposing party,and his counsel.
plaintiffs michael clement and michael clement plaintiffs appeal from the contra costa county superior court imposition of as discovery sanctions.the sanctions were awarded against plaintiffs for interposing objections to special interrogatories propounded by defendant and respondent frank alegre,which objections the discovery referee found to be unreasonable,evasive,lacking in legal merit and without justification.we agree and shall affirm the sanctions order.
background 
plaintiffs sued defendant for,among other things,specific performance and unspecified damages in connection with a dispute arising out of the sale of real property by plaintiffs to defendant.the substantive facts of the underlying action are not relevant to the merits of the issues raised on this appeal.
on november,defendant alegre served two identical sets of special interrogatories on plaintiffs one set to plaintiff clement,the individual,and one set to plaintiff corporation the interrogatories requested information on damages,causation,and the existence of a loan commitment.plaintiffs answered three of the interrogatories and interposed objections to twenty.as described by the referee,plaintiffs objections were of two types 
special interrogatory requested a description of all economic damages you claim to have sustained clement objected that the question was vague and ambiguous.clement contention that the term economic damages is vague is based on propounding party failure to specifically refer to civil code section,subdivision b which defines economic damages.thus,reasons clement,responding party reasonably construes the failure to adopt this definition as expressing propounding party intention to define economic damages in a manner different than as provided in california civil code section,subdivision b.clement goes on to supply a restricted definition of his own,to wit the lost profit from the potential sale of the property to a third party buyer.thus limited,he answers that he is aware of none.
special interrogatory asks please state the amount of such damages as identified in interrogatory number.clement objections this time were that this special interrogatory violates section,subdivision d because it is not full and complete in itself,requiring,as it does,reference to the answer to an earlier interrogatory in the same set.he brands the reference to the answer to an earlier question as reference to other materials in order to answer the question,citing catanese superior court th,d catanese.plaintiff clement also stated that he did not have to answer the interrogatory,because it would deny him days to respond,as interrogatory was a question that referred to the answer to interrogatory,and there could be no answer to interrogatory in existence until the response to interrogatory was rendered.the days to answer interrogatory would start after the answer to interrogatory.finally,clement stated that he would meet and confer in good faith with defendant to resolve any dispute,without the need for a motion.however,he also stated no response to a meet and confer communications could be given without reasonable time and opportunity to consult with his attorney.
the objection to the term economic damages as vague and ambiguous was interposed to interrogatory and.the objection that the interrogatories violated section,subdivision d because each was not full and complete in itself was interposed to interrogatory through,through,and.
the parties engaged in a series of meet and confer letters.see,subd.b.upon receiving plaintiffs objections,defendant counsel,steven piser,pointed out by letter dated january,that clement himself had quoted civil code section,subdivision b in his objection and characterized it as the generally accepted definition for economic damages.defendant counsel then reiterated that that was the information sought.with respect to plaintiffs objections that each interrogatory was not full and complete in and of itself,subd.d,piser distinguished catanese,supra,th,d,argued that each interrogatory was full and complete in and of itself,and explained with respect to interrogatory,t he fact that the question asks for a quantification of damages that were requested to be described in an earlier interrogatory does not make it incomplete the interrogatory merely asks for the amount of damages your client is claiming as a result of alegre alleged breach of any agreement between your clients and him.counsel made a similar argument for each of the interrogatories challenged on this basis.
plaintiffs counsel,samuel goldstein,responded on january,suggesting that the interrogatories be withdrawn and replacement discovery,eliminating the concerns stated,be served on plaintiffs.goldstein reiterated that the definition of economic damages was vague and suggested that defendant counsel should redraft the interrogatories to provide a definition of the term.as to the balance,goldstein stated that although the interrogatories do not create the immense burden noted by the catanese court,they do violate the code.
piser responded on january,reiterating defendant position,that the interrogatories were full and complete in and of themselves and that the term economic damages was clear.he notified plaintiffs that he would be filing a motion to compel and for sanctions.he again advised that the interrogatories contemplated a broad definition of the term economic damages,in accordance with the statutory definition plaintiffs had cited.attorney goldstein responded via a faxed letter on january,stating that plaintiffs were willing to accept the revised and more expansive definition of the term economic damages and would respond within days of a letter providing a written definition of the term.he also reiterated plaintiffs demand that defendants serve replacement special interrogatories that eliminate improper incorporation by reference of other answers.
on january,defendant moved to compel further responses to the special interrogatories,to strike objections,and for sanctions against plaintiff corporation and attorney goldstein.defendant had already moved in late december to compel answers and for sanctions against clement the individual as distinct from the corporation on grounds of his failure to respond to the special interrogatories.clement responded on december,raising the same objections as had the corporation.
the matter was heard by discovery referee,laurence kay,on august,nine months after the interrogatories had been propounded.on august,the referee found,citing deyo kilbourne d,that plaintiffs had deliberately misconstrued the question insofar as they contended the phrase economic damages was too vague.he further found with respect to plaintiffs claim that an interrogatory that referenced a prior interrogatory was not full and complete in itself,that the case cited by plaintiffs was inapposite and the objection frivolous.the referee determined the objections and each of them to be unreasonable,evasive,lacking in legal merit and without justification.citing,subd.a,et and,subds.e and f.
the referee also found that the exchange of letters reflected the parties were at an impasse that could not be resolved through meet and confer and found without merit plaintiffs suggestion that it was defendant who failed to properly engage in the meet and confer process.the referee found moot and did not address defendant claim that objections were waived by the tardy filing of the responses of clement individually.
consequently,the referee recommended that plaintiffs be ordered to provide further answers without any of the objections previously interposed and recommended sanctions be imposed by the court as follows plaintiffs were to reimburse defendant for legal fees,plus for filing the motions to compel and for defendant of the referee fee for referee time spent exclusively on the motion not including one and hours of hearing time on the motion,as other motions were heard at that same hearing.the court adopted the referee order on september,and the order was entered on september.this timely appeal followed 
discussion 
monetary sanctions authorized 
the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process,or any attorney advising that conduct,or both pay the reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct if a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title,the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust,subd.a,italics added.
misuse of the discovery process includes failing to respond or submit to authorized discovery,providing evasive discovery responses,disobeying a court order to provide discovery,unsuccessfully making or opposing discovery motions without substantial justification,and failing to meet and confer in good faith to resolve a discovery dispute when required by statute to do so.citation.in re marriage of michaely th,d,italics added.

vagueness objection to economic damages term 
plaintiffs assert that economic damages was not a defined term in defendant discovery and that the term was,therefore,ambiguous.this contention is preposterous in the circumstances presented.moreover,plaintiff reliance upon attorney goldstein assertion in the trial court that he did not intend to be evasive or to avoid providing information completely ignores the applicable standard of review.
ample evidence supports the referee determination that plaintiffs deliberately misconstrued the question.plaintiffs themselves quoted the statute defining the term in their initial response.yet,they objected,and then deliberately provided an answer using a definition narrower than that provided by statute.somewhat artfully,plaintiffs urge that goldstein agreed in his january,letter to respond to any definition of economic damages that plaintiffs chose to provide.however,even after defendant counsel advised that the term was being used as defined in the statute plaintiffs had cited,plaintiffs did not answer the question,but demanded that defendant supply the definition in writing and allow them an extra days from the date of receipt in which to respond.clearly this was and supports the referee findings and the sanctions award.
even assuming we agreed that neither plaintiffs nor goldstein intended to be we do intent is not relevant here.there is no requirement that misuse of the discovery process must be willful for a monetary sanction to be imposed.cal.civil discovery practice ed.may update,citing code civ.proc,subd.a hogan weber,cal.civil discovery ed.sanctions,whenever one party improper if not willful in seeking or resisting discovery necessitate the court intervention in a dispute,the losing party presumptively should pay a sanction to the prevailing party.fn.omitted kohan cohan d.
sanctions were warranted here,as plaintiffs objection to the term economic damages was without substantial justification and their responses to those interrogatories were evasive,subd.a,subds.e and f.
objection that question was not full and complete in and of itself 
plaintiffs objections to most of the interrogatories propounded by defendant were based on the assertion that an interrogatory failed to comply with the statutory requirement that each be full and complete in and of itself,where it referred to a previous interrogatory.section,subdivision d provides each interrogatory shall be full and complete in and of itself.no preface or instruction shall be included with a set of interrogatories unless it has been approved under chapter commencing with section form interrogatories approved by the judicial council.all special interrogatories are subject to the requirements of this section and to the presumptive numerical limitation of section,subdivision b,providing with certain exceptions that no party shall,as a matter of right,propound to any other party more than specially prepared interrogatories see also.
plaintiffs do not contend that any of the interrogatories to which they objected on this basis were unclear,or that the interrogatories,considered either singly or collectively,in any way undermined or violated the presumptive numerical limit of interrogatories of section.yet plaintiffs seized on what might have been at most an arguable technical violation of the rule,to object to interrogatories that were clear and concise where the interrogatories did not even arguably violate the presumptive numerical limitation set by statute.in so doing,plaintiffs themselves engaged in the type of gamesmanship and delay decried by the drafters of the act 
the rule that each specially prepared interrogatory must be full and complete by itself,subd.d,together with the rule that n o specially prepared interrogatory shall contain subparts,or a compound,conjunctive,or disjunctive question,subd.f prevent evasion of the statutory limit on the number of interrogatories that one party may propound to another.hogan weber,cal.civil discovery,supra,interrogatories to a party,to,footnote omitted.
the reporter notes,authored by professor hogan,explain the genesis of the numerical limitation and the format restrictions embraced by the act.paragraph now,subdivision a of the proposed subdivision makes a major change in the existing law by imposing a presumptive limit of on the number of interrogatories that may be propounded without leave of court or stipulation.in proposing this presumptive limit on the number of interrogatories,the discovery commission is addressing a concern that is well expressed in the following passage from deyo kilbourne,supra,d.lengthy interrogatories suitable to major litigation are often needlessly used in small cases.questions are often repetitious or wholly irrelevant.while our discovery laws are designed to prevent trial by ambush,the most common cry from lawyers is that they are being papered to death.hogan weber,cal.civil discovery,supra,appendix d,proposed california civil discovery act of,and reporter notes at.
