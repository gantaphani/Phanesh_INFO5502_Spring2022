factual background and procedural history 
factual background 
plaintiffs are employees of the city of los angeles,department of water and power.the plaintiffs are also members of local.randall baker is a principal security guard and james butts and richard singletary are senior security guards.
the terms and conditions of plaintiffs employment are governed by a memorandum of understanding mou between dwp and local which was in effect from october,to september.article a of the mou provided that overtime would be divided as equally as possible among those persons available for work in the same position at the same location or reporting to the same immediate supervisor.the department had a policy of assigning overtime to those with the least amount of accumulated overtime first such persons were those within hours of the lowest accumulated total on the accumulative overtime log aotl.
plaintiffs asserted that local failed in its duty to ensure that dwp equally disseminated overtime hours.another principal security officer at dwp received hours of overtime during a one year period ending march,while plaintiff baker only received hours of overtime with hours declined for the same period.plaintiffs butts and singletary had similar complaints about the amount of overtime they received.
pursuant to the mou appendix d,local and dwp agreed to the establishment of a joint committee jlmc.the committee has an equal number of members from local and dwp,and is the forum in which plaintiffs and their colleagues address grievances about the terms and conditions of their employment.
many members of local complained about the problem to their union representative,gus corona,during and.in december,a security officer complained to corona that the jlmc was a joke because it did not meet regularly,had not achieved the goals it set out to achieve,and did not get anything done.to plaintiff baker,corona responded on november,i am sorry you feel this way i will be requesting you be removed from the jlm c.the members continued to complain about corona.
section,subdivision a of the government code authorizes public agencies to adopt rules and regulations to implement the provisions of the mmba,and in,the city adopted an employee relations ordinance ero for this purpose,subd.a see admin.code,et.
on may,plaintiffs,butts,baker and singletary filed an unfair practice charge with the california public employment relations board perb,alleging a violation of the mmba.all three sought an order directing dwp and local to comply with article and appendix d of the mou.
on june,robert bergeson,the executive director of erb responded to plaintiffs claims before erb and advised plaintiffs that the facts alleged in their claims did not amount to a prima facie violation of the ero because the ero governed interference claims and discrimination claims although the claims might constitute a valid grievance under the mou,they did not violate the ero.
on august,plaintiffs filed unfair practices claims with erb.
on august,plaintiffs requested bergeson advisory 
procedural background 
on march,plaintiffs filed a complaint against the city and local for violation of the duty of fair representation and breach of contract and breach of the collective bargaining agreement.on may,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint alleging the same claims.
local demurred to the first amended complaint on the grounds the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under section because that section gave erb exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a charge of the breach of the duty of fair representation was justified.the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend,primarily finding erb had exclusive jurisdiction over the action under section,subdivision d 
on august,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,alleging the same claims and further alleging they exhausted their administrative remedies.on september,local demurred,contending the erb had exclusive initial jurisdiction to review unfair practices claims,and that courts would exercise limited appellate jurisdiction after review by erb in any event,plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with erb because erb had not formally ruled on their claims,and plaintiffs could not state a claim that local had acted in bad faith.
the court overruled the demurrer on december.the court found there was no dispositive authority that plaintiffs were required to exhaust administrative remedies under these circumstances where the issue of exclusive jurisdiction is not definite and where the statutory language of section can be read to support either party position.
at the mandatory settlement conference held april,the trial court suggested that local filed a pretrial motion on the subject matter jurisdiction issue.
on may,local moved to dismiss the action based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction,contending erb had exclusive initial jurisdiction of the matter under section,subdivision d of the mmba.after receiving supplemental briefing on the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies,the trial court granted the motion,finding the matter within the exclusive initial jurisdiction of erb 
on november,local moved for sanctions pursuant to code of civil procedure section on the grounds plaintiffs had no factual basis for their overtime claims they failed to file a grievance with local,as required by the mou and they had no evidence of bad faith conduct by local.the trial court denied the motion for sanctions,finding a factual issue existed whether local conduct was in bad faith.
discussion 
superior court subject matter jurisdiction of plaintiffs claims 
plaintiffs argue that erb does not have exclusive initial jurisdiction over their unfair representation claims because section,subdivision d makes no reference to exclusivity,but merely grants to erb the authority to engage in proceedings concerning unit determinations,elections,unfair practices,regardless of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to perb elsewhere in the statute.further,even if erb had exclusive initial jurisdiction,plaintiffs exhausted their administrative remedies,thus permitting them to proceed in superior court.respondents contend that when the legislature enacted section,subdivision d,it did not intend to give the courts jurisdiction over enforcement of mmba violations handled by erb.rather,the same jurisdictional rules apply to erb as apply to perb namely,perb and erb have exclusive initial jurisdiction,with appellate review by the courts,subd.d.
standard of review 
although the trial court overruled the demurrer,it granted local evidentiary motion to dismiss the second amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we consider de novo a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where the question is purely one of law.see mckee orange unified school dist.th.where the question depends on findings of fact,we apply the substantial evidence test if the facts are disputed.see mcknight ranch,franchise tax bd.th.if the facts are undisputed,we resolve the question as a matter of law.see superior court th.
