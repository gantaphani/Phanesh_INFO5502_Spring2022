background 
bankruptcy court proceedings 
this appeal arises from chapter bankruptcy proceedings commenced by kalikow on august,in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the bankruptcy court.on december,kalikow filed a plan of reorganization.the plan vested kalikow with the property of the estate,free from creditors interests,and discharged kalikow from any claim and any debt that arose before the effective date.in particular,every holder of a discharged claim was precluded from asserting against kalikow any further claim based on any document,instrument or act,omission,transaction or other activity of any kind or nature that occurred prior to the effective date.
the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan pursuant to a confirmation order dated january.the confirmation order 
made the plan and its provisions binding upon the debtors and any holder of a claim against or interest in the debtors.
relieved kalikow of all liability to any holder of a claim for any activity arising out of the confirmation.
operated as a discharge as to each holder of a claim,relieving the debtors from all debts that arose against them prior to or on the effective date.
precluded any creditor holding a discharged debt from asserting against the debtors,any other or further claim based upon activity prior to the effective date.
restrained and enjoined all creditors whose claims are discharged from employing any process or any act to collect,recover,or offset such debts,except as provided in the plan.
the confirmation order also preserved creditors claims for liability created by the express terms of any agreement or other document executed and delivered by kalikow in connection with implementation of the plan.
as part of the plan,kalikow was required to submit to the bankruptcy court a representation letter the representation letter that would provide unsecured creditors assurance that kalikow had made a full disclosure of their assets.kalikow submitted such a letter on february.the representation letter reserved to the plan administrator an enforcement mechanism in the event of a breach by kalikow.it authorized the plan administrator,on behalf of creditors,to pursue a claim as a result of a misrepresentation or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in the representation letter up to ten years from the plan effective,until february.this provision of the representation letter was incorporated into section of the plan administrator agreement,which stated that e xcept as expressly provided in this section of the plan administrator agreement,no person other than the plan administrator shall have authority to commence any legal action or otherwise pursue any right or remedy with respect to any misrepresentation or breach of warranty under the kalikow representation letter.should the plan administrator decline to pursue such a claim,section of the plan administrator agreement authorized an unsecured creditor to seek the court permission to pursue a claim as described in the representation letter 
in february,a few weeks after the confirmation order had issued,solow provided kalikow with a million loan and received in exchange an option to buy an interest in kalikow reorganized business.kalikow repaid that loan in june than five years earlier than it was due.kalikow then repurchased the from solow for million in.the rapid repayment of the loan and repurchase of the option caused solow to speculate that kalikow had concealed a portion of their assets from creditors.solow never produced any evidence to support that speculation.in,solow moved in the bankruptcy court for the appointment of an examiner to investigate kalikow representations.by this time,the bankruptcy cases were closed.the plan administrator had been discharged on december.kalikow opposed the motion,arguing that solow lacked standing to bring it as a lender who has been paid in full.the motion was denied.
approximately seven years after solow motion was denied,as the period for postconfirmation claims was about to expire,solow and consulted dreier llp with respect to the approaching claims deadline of february.at that time,marc dreier dreier of dreier llp contacted evergence,a defunct florida corporation,and kovachev,evergence owner,to front as the contact for notices the notices to apprise unsecured creditors under the chapter plan of reorganization of debtors peter kalikow and kalikow real estate co of possible claims.the notices contained a list of creditors of the estates,some listed with the amounts of their claims,followed by the statement you may have additional rights of recovery based on a failure by the debtors to make truthful disclosure.the deadline for your pursuing additional recovery is february.all interested creditors should contact the undersigned.the notices bore the name of evergence,and provided phone and fax numbers however,these numbers were associated with a telephone and fax machine on the premises of dreier llp.after the publication of the notices on february and,in the new york times and the new york post a number of listed creditors attempted to contact evergence,either individually or by counsel.in response to the notices,there were eighteen letters from former creditors or their counsel faxed to the fax number provided,and there were telephone calls from separate numbers made to the number provided.the law firm of bingham mccutchen prepared for its client,fifth avenue owners,inc,and faxed to the number provided,a proof of claim for submission to the bankruptcy court.nfs services,also submitted a letter of authority to collect on behalf of its client,lehman brothers holdings.however,no creditor submitted a claim to the bankruptcy court or plan administrator,or attempted to recover from kalikow directly.
in response to the notices,on april,kalikow filed the motion seeking an order pursuant to to reopen kalikow substantively consolidated bankruptcy cases.on april,kalikow filed the enforcement motion,pursuant to,seeking to enforc e the release,discharge,and injunction provisions of the plan and confirmation order.the enforcement motion was directed against evergence capital advisors,and its directors,officers,controlling persons,and agents,including the law firm of dreier llp.the motion identified evergence as a defunct florida corporation,dissolved on october.kosta kovachev was identified as the president of evergence kalikow alleged in the enforcement motion that the notices had been placed in bad faith,had been designed to appear as if ordered by a court,had created confusion among creditors,and had injured kalikow reputation.the enforcement motion sought an order enjoining publication of the notices pursuant to the plan,the confirmation order,and,directing evergence to cease and desist from engaging in any further such actions requiring evergence to publish corrective notice of the same size,placement,and frequency in the same publications and imposing sanctions on evergence in the amount of kalikow costs and attorneys fees related to investigating and responding to the notices.
on may,kalikow deposed marc dreier at the offices of dreier llp to discover any information dreier might have regarding the notices.at that time,dreier declined to name the clients who had contacted dreier llp with regard to the claims,citing privilege.sometime thereafter,the bankruptcy court held a conference in chambers and compelled disclosure.when the deposition resumed on may,dreier named solow and cherniak as the firm clients.
on june,dreier llp filed an objection to the enforcement motion on behalf of solow and cherniak,claiming that kalikow motions had sought no relief against them.the objection disputed kalikow allegations of bad faith,arguing that the notices had been placed in order to alert creditors,before the deadline expired,to the possibility of claims based on kalikow misrepresentations.the objection also argued that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,that the dispute should be heard by a formal adversary proceeding,and that there was no legal basis for relief.kalikow filed a reply on june,stating that relief would be sought against dreier individually,as well as against solow and cherniak.
at a hearing on june,in the bankruptcy court,the court granted kalikow motions.the bankruptcy court found that the notices implicate d the injunctive provisions of the plan and confirmation order.the court considered,inter alia,the timing of the appellants actions in placing the advertisements nine years after kalikow repaid solow and repurchased the option,and seven years after solow motion to appoint an examiner was denied the choice to publish the notices in two of new york most newspapers as a method of contacting addresses and contact information could have been easily mailing the information would have been significantly less expensive the notices had the appearance of legal notices that are published at the direction of this court and t he n otices were designed to mislead the public into thinking that they have a right to reassert discharged claims.the court also found that none of the appellants was a former unsecured creditor of kalikow.the court concluded that the notices had not been placed in good faith and rejected the argument that,because no creditor had attempted to collect a discharged claim,the injunction had not been violated.as to the injunctive relief requested by kalikow,the bankruptcy court declined to grant this request,stating that because no creditors took the respondents bait beyond retention of counsel and inquiry at their expense,the requested injunctive relief would serve no basic purpose at this point in time.instead,the court awarded the recovery of costs incurred in investigating and bringing on this process,with other forms of relief more appropriately addressed in other proceedings.
on june,the bankruptcy court issued a written order the first order restating its oral ruling of june.the first order imposed sanctions on evergence capital advisors,and its directors,officers,controlling persons,and agents,including the law firm of dreier llp,and solow,cherniak,dreier and kovachev.the court ordered 
that the former debtors shall provide to the sanctioned parties billing information the invoices and receipts evidencing the costs and expenses,including without limitation attorneys fees and expenses the total costs and expenses incurred by the former debtors in connection with the enforcement motion and in otherwise investigating and responding to the notices through the date of the hearing.
the court further ordered that any objections to kalikow statement of expenses be made within five days of kalikow submission,at which point the court would schedule a hearing to determine the proper amount of sanctions to be awarded.
on june,kalikow submitted its statement of expenses in the amount of,to which the appellants objected,and the bankruptcy court scheduled a hearing to determine the proper amount of sanctions.kalikow submitted a larger request on july,totaling,which reflected costs incurred after the june hearing and up to july.
on september,the appellants objected to the expenses and costs submitted by kalikow,arguing that the total amount was excessive,that individual entries were ambiguous or unreasonable,that costs incurred after june should be excluded,and that costs for speaking with the new york times reporters and drafting professional grievances were not legitimately within those awarded.because solow,cherniak,and dreier had not been made parties to the case prior to the adjudication of their liability,the appellants also objected to any award based on the underlying merits,submitting a declaration by dreier,with several attachments,explaining the basis of solow and cherniak for believing that kalikow might have misrepresented their assets in the earlier bankruptcy proceeding and explaining their desire to alert creditors to the issue before the deadline expired.
in a hearing held on september,the bankruptcy court concluded that it did not find the amounts that are requested by kalikow to be unusual given all of the circumstances of this case the sanction here i find is appropriate and it is justified by the documentation that has been submitted to the c ourt.the bankruptcy court also stated that the proper amount of costs and expenses would include those incurred through the date of the september,hearing because the request for fees today has been caused by the covert behavior of the appellants as well as the tendency to extensively litigate almost all matters that surrounded the various orders and issues that are here,including the appellants submissions devoted to the underlying merits.the court concluded that the expenses and costs were fair,reasonable,and appropriate and included costs up to today.
on october,the bankruptcy court issued a written order the second order requiring the appellants to pay to kalikow,but staying payment if the appellants posted a bond with the bankruptcy court,pending final judgment on appeal.the appellants posted the bond of the requisite amount on october,and timely appealed to the united states district court for the southern district of new york.
ii.the district court decision 
the first and second orders were appealed to the district court,and the appeals were consolidated in that court.in the district court,four of the appellants,evergence,kovachev,dreier llp,and marc dreier,argued that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to hear allegations of conduct so far afield from the subject of the injunctions.they also argued that the notices had not violated any injunction that the sanctions were legally unwarranted that the bankruptcy court lacked personal jurisdiction over that the court had erred in weighing the evidence and that the sanctions were excessive.solow and cherniak joined the foregoing arguments and submitted a brief with respect to personal jurisdiction.
the district court rejected all of the appellants arguments in an unpublished decision dated september,entered as judgment on september,and affirmed the judgment and orders of the bankruptcy court.the court held that the bankruptcy court had personal jurisdiction over solow and cherniak,who had intentionally sought to keep their identities secret the bankruptcy court did not err in proceeding by motion instead of an adversary proceeding because it had been asked to enforce a previous injunction and not to issue a new injunction and the bankruptcy court neither committed clear error nor abused its discretion in imposing sanctions against the appellants and awarding costs and fees to kalikow solow and cherniak filed a notice of an appeal to this court on october.evergence,dreier llp,marc dreier,and kosta kovachev filed their notice of an appeal to this court on october.
on appeal,solow and cherniak argue that the bankruptcy court did not have personal jurisdiction over solow and cherniak that the bankruptcy court erred in proceeding by motion instead of an adversary proceeding and that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that the appellants had violated the injunctive provisions of the plan and therefore abused its discretion in imposing sanctions against them.
of the standard of review 
a district court order in a bankruptcy case is subject to plenary review,meaning that this court undertakes an independent examination of the factual findings and legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court.in re duplan,cir.findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.id.the bankruptcy court interpretation of the text of the plan and the confirmation order are conclusions of law reviewed de novo.id.
a bankruptcy court award of sanctions will not be set aside by this court in the absence of an abuse of discretion.in re highgate equities,cir sussman bank of israel,cir.the bankruptcy court necessarily abuse s its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.in re highgate equities,at.
ii.of personal jurisdiction over solow and cherniak 
solow and cherniak argue that although they had notice of the enforcement motion and related proceedings,they were never made proper parties to the proceedings nor properly served with process.specifically,solow and cherniak argue that kalikow motions were never amended to name them as respondents and were insufficiently descriptive to alert them that relief was being sought against them.solow and cherniak also claim that service of kalikow enforcement motion on dreier,the attorney who represented solow and cherniak at that time,constituted inadequate service as to them.both the bankruptcy court and the district court rejected these arguments,finding that solow and cherniak could not have been named in the motion to reopen and the enforcement motion because they purposefully concealed their identities until their attorney,marc dreier,was ordered by the bankruptcy court to reveal their names,and that solow and cherniak were sufficiently apprised and given notice of the motions.
before a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a party,the procedural requirement of service must be satisfied.dynegy midstream servs.trammochem,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also murphy,michetti pipe stringing,d stating that service of process is fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant.these due process requirements apply in motion proceedings,contested proceedings under bankruptcy rule b with the same force as in adversarial proceedings under bankruptcy rule.in re zumbrun,cir.
i n a contested matter,as here,the notice of hearing is treated as a summons and the motion is treated as a complaint.in re parker.consistent with due process,bankruptcy rule requires that reasonable notice be given to the party against whom relief is sought.contrary to solow and cherniak claim,the motion need not specifically name the parties to the matter.see in re zumbrun,at.although the failure to amend a caption to name the parties may constitute a violation of federal rule of civil procedure,such error does not per se constitute a deprivation of due process.see baker latham sparrowbush,cir stating that to satisfy due process,notice need only be reasonably calculated to apprise the adverse party internal quotation marks omitted.
here,kalikow motion sought an order against evergence and its directors,officers,controlling persons,and agents,including the law firm of dreier llp.moreover the motion specified that its terms would apply to parties,noting that t he use of evergence to place the notices makes it likely that the individuals behind the notices do not want to be identified i t appears that certain parties are using evergence as a front here to pursue their improper ends.thus,we agree with the lower courts that the motion was sufficiently descriptive to alert solow and cherniak that relief was being sought against them.indeed,after solow and cherniak identities were revealed following much resistance,kalikow expressly stated in its reply to dreier llp objection that relief was sought against solow and cherniak.
alternatively,solow and cherniak argue that they were not properly served.they,however,do not dispute that their counsel,dreier llp,was properly served.although solow and cherniak argue that dreier llp did not represent them,the record clearly establishes that solow and cherniak engaged dreier llp to place the notices and dreier llp continued to act as counsel for solow and cherniak in connection with the enforcement motion.for example,dreier stated during his deposition that w e continue to represent these clients insofar as these clients need representation in connection with this matter.and in the appellants submitted objections to kalikow motions in the bankruptcy court,dreier acknowledged that for purposes of full disclosure to the court,it should be noted that dreier llp was retained by sheldon solow and stephen in their individual connection with some of the facts and events upon which the injunction motion is based.moreover,dreier llp filed their papers on behalf of solow and cherniak on july,attempted to submit papers on their behalf on september,and appeared at a hearing on their behalf on september.indeed,the record establishes that dreier llp was not only solow trusted lawyer in this case but also in other litigation as well.luedke delta air lines,holding that defendant active participation through its counsel in one proceeding implicitly authorized counsel to accept service on client behalf in related proceeding in re reisman.proper service on dreier llp,therefore,constituted proper service on solow and cherniak.e.
thus,because solow and cherniak were properly served and given reasonable notice of the relief sought against them,we conclude that the bankruptcy court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over them.
iii.of the bankruptcy court decision to proceed by motion 
solow and cherniak argue that because kalikow enforcement motion sought injunctive relief,the bankruptcy court was required to conduct the case as an adversary proceeding,rather than a contested matter.citing to federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,which requires the commencement of an adversary proceeding to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief,solow and cherniak argue that kalikow should have been required to have commenced an adversary proceeding in response to the publication of the notices.specifically,solow and cherniak claim that kalikow sought injunctive relief in the enforcement motion beyond the enforcement of those injunctions provided for in the plan and confirmation order.the bankruptcy court rejected this claim,finding that the enforcement motion involved the enforcement of a injunction,a consideration that permits the resolution of the motion as a contested matter rather than through an adversary proceeding.s
