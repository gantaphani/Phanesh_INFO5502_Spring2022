armand rosenberg appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york naomi reice buchwald,judge finding him liable pursuant to new york judiciary law for treble damages arising from several of his actual and attempted acts of deception on new york state courts in the course of litigation before them.see amalfitano rosenberg,d.on appeal,he contends that the district court finding that the appellate division was deceived was not supported by clear and convincing evidence and the district court erred in concluding that section imposes liability for attempted deceit.
for the reasons that follow,we certify to the new york court of appeals two questions regarding whether section permits recovery of damages based on an attempted,but unsuccessful,deceit.
background 
three brothers,peter,james,and john costalas,were at one time engaged in a family real estate and restaurant business together.unbeknownst to james and john,peter undertook a series of personal business transactions that ultimately resulted in the loss of four of five buildings owned by the family,and eleven of their twelve restaurants.peter diverted between eight and ten million dollars of the family business to himself,forging the signatures of several members of his family on business documents.he used this money both to fund his palatial apartment overlooking central park and to cover his losses from extensive and ultimately unsuccessful options trading.
rosenberg,a member of the new york bar,began representing peter in the early after these misadventures first came to light.the representation included several foreclosure proceedings on the family buildings.rosenberg also negotiated with james and john on peter behalf to dissuade them from seeking to have criminal charges brought against peter.
the gruntal litigation 
although james and john did not in the end seek to have criminal charges brought against peter,they did file a civil lawsuit against him,also naming as a defendant gruntal,gruntal,the broker peter used in his unsuccessful options trading.see complaint at,costalas gruntal,civ.filed,the gruntal litigation.rosenberg never formally appeared in the gruntal litigation,but he was retained by peter and communicated with james and john counsel,vito vincenti,on several occasions with regard to the gruntal litigation.
the august agreement 
in august,john and peter signed an agreement the august agreement in which peter assigned his interest in the family business and partnerships to john in exchange for.the assets transferred included peter interest in the partnership known as whitehall street group,which owned the one building the family had not lost,located at whitehall street in manhattan whitehall street.peter also assigned to john of any recovery he might receive in his against gruntal 
rosenberg represented peter in the negotiations that led to the drafting of the august agreement.he held several telephone conversations with vincenti in connection with it,and he received several drafts of the agreement.rosenberg was also instrumental in negotiating a settlement of peter against gruntal,which involved a payment of.in accordance with the august agreement,rosenberg retained of the payment as his fee and divided the remaining into two equal checks vivia amalfitano,james daughter and one of the appellees in this case,picked up one of those checks on her father behalf.it is not clear from the record what happened to the other check for of the settlement.presumably,it went to john.
on april,peter was dismissed as a party to the gruntal litigation by stipulation.
the costalas litigation 
in,after the upheaval that resulted from the discovery of peter wrongdoing,vivia began to assume responsibility for the family business.at that point the business included just one restaurant and the building at whitehall street.the building was subject to a mortgage at the time.in,vivia purchased the building from the family in order to avoid foreclosure.the contract of sale was assigned to vivia corporation,msa twins.vivia personally guaranteed the mortgage loan,and john and james were released from their obligations on the mortgage.
on may,peter,represented by rosenberg,initiated a lawsuit in new york state court against vivia and her husband,gerard amalfitano,alleging that they had defrauded the family business and partnership in the sale of whitehall street.see complaint at,costalas amalfitano.filed may,the costalas litigation despite the august agreement removing peter from the partnership,the complaint alleged that peter was a member of the partnership.on july,the amalfitanos moved to dismiss the complaint in the costalas litigation on the ground that peter lacked any interest in whitehall street because he had transferred his interest to john under the august agreement.
in response to the motion to dismiss,rosenberg filed a for summary judgment.in its support,he prepared an affidavit,executed by peter,that asserted that the august agreement was never intended and did not have any real effect because peter prior attorney,oscar goldberg,had advised him to sign the agreement as a sham to avoid potential creditors.
supreme court,new york county ira gammerman,granted the amalfitanos motion to dismiss.rosenberg,on behalf of his client peter,moved to vacate the dismissal.justice gammerman denied the motion on the grounds that peter was prohibited by the parol evidence rule from arguing that the august agreement was a sham,and peter lacked standing to bring the lawsuit 
rosenberg,on peter behalf,appealed the denial of the motion to vacate to the appellate division,first department.included in the record on appeal was peter affidavit asserting that the august agreement was a sham.also included were several of the family partnership tax returns,which had erroneously continued to list peter as a partner even after the august agreement was executed.the first department reversed the order of the trial court,concluding that there were s erious open questions regarding the real need for and purpose of the purported assignment and whether peter was a member of the partnership.costalas amalfitano,dep t.
back in the trial court,the parties proceeded with discovery.thereafter,justice gammerman granted the amalfitanos motion to dismiss.rosenberg then moved on peter behalf to vacate the dismissal based on alleged ex parte communications between the amalfitanos counsel and justice gammerman.the motion was denied.the first department unanimously affirmed the trial court judgment.see costalas amalfitano,dep t.
the instant suit 
on march,the amalfitanos filed the instant diversity action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.the complaint alleged that rosenberg conduct in the costalas litigation violated new york judiciary law and caused them damages in the form of attorney fees and expenses from that litigation.
the case was tried to the bench over a period of four days.the amalfitanos called as witnesses themselves,vito vincenti,and rosenberg.rosenberg called no witnesses.
in addition to finding the facts described above,the district court concluded that rosenberg engaged in a persistent pattern of unethical behavior during the costalas litigation.amalfitano,d at.
first,after the amalfitanos served a notice of deposition on the former family accountant,howard komendant,rosenberg sent komendant a letter stating,in part,you should be advised,that in my opinion,if,in fact,you served in a professional capacity,all communications,contacts and documents were of a privileged nature.rosenberg cited no authority for this proposition and failed to respond to opposing counsel letter citing authority that there is no privilege in new york.rosenberg subsequently failed to attend the komendant deposition.komendant nonetheless brought counsel to the deposition,and the amalfitanos were required to pay for the cost of his attendance.
second,rosenberg failed to correct peter deposition testimony to the effect that john and james had never brought suit against gruntal,that peter had never signed any documents during the gruntal litigation,and th
