steven brenner and his wife jami weisner petition this court to review the decision of the commodity futures trading commission the commission finding them liable for violations of the commodity exchange act the act and imposing sanctions pursuant to those liability determinations.the petitioners argue that there was insufficient evidence to support the entry of summary disposition against them,and that even had there been enough evidence,the commission erred in imposing sanctions in the amount and manner it did.for the following reasons,we reject the petitioners appeal and affirm the decision of the commission on both the findings of liability and the imposition of sanctions.
steven brenner is no stranger to the legal process surrounding the trading of commodity futures.the legal quagmire in which the brenners find themselves today began back in,when brenner was ordered by the commission to pay damages for churning a customer account.wagner commonwealth commodities,cftc docket,cftc lexis,at alj.when he failed to satisfy that judgment against him,the commission placed him on its sanctions in effect list.see in re brenner,cftc docket,cftc lexis,at cftc.once added to that list,brenner was automatically barred from trading on any markets regulated by the commission.see f.
the automatic trading ban,however,did not deter brenner.despite receiving notice of his placement on the sanctions list and the resulting automatic trading ban,brenner continued to trade on domestic futures markets through several futures commission merchants fcms.in march,the commission was forced to bring another complaint against brenner for violating the trading ban.in re brenner,cftc lexis,at.brenner failed to answer the complaint,and an administrative law judge alj held him in default and imposed sanctions including a order,a trading ban,and a civil monetary penalty.in re brenner,cftc docket,cftc lexis alj.
still not deterred,brenner opened an account in under his wife name and,posing as her,traded on markets.in july,the commission filed an action in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,alleging that brenner used a fictitious name to trade futures contracts in violation of the trading ban.on july,the district court entered an order of permanent injunction against brenner.see in re brenner,cftc docket,cftc lexis,at cftc.over the next two years,brenner continued trading in violation of the court order,and the department of justice pursued criminal prosecution of brenner under for disobeying a lawful order of a court.see in re brenner,cftc docket,cftc lexis,at cftc.in december,brenner pleaded guilty to trading in violation of the injunction and was sentenced to weekend detention for one month and two years probation.id.at.
on march,the commission issued yet another complaint against complaint giving rise to this that from january through october,brenner violated section of the act by trading on markets in violation of the commission order imposing the trading ban the complaint additionally alleged that weisner willfully aided and abetted brenner illegal trading,thus incurring her own liability pursuant to section a of the act by may,neither brenner nor weisner had responded to the complaint having instead filed a motion to dismiss and a motion for a more definite statement,and the alj hearing the case ordered them to show cause why a default judgment should not be entered against them.
rather than answer,brenner and weisner asserted three privileges as the basis for refusing to admit or deny the allegations in the commission complaint the fifth amendment privilege against the privilege against adverse spousal testimony and the privilege protecting confidential marital communications.the commission division of enforcement the division later served brenner and weisner with separate requests for admissions,but both asserted the same privileges as the basis for refusing to respond.
in october,the division moved for summary disposition,pursuant to commission rule arguing that it had presented undisputed facts establishing that while brenner was subject to the commission trading ban,he repeatedly traded futures on markets regulated by the commission,using accounts opened under various assumed names,including that of his wife.the division further argued that the undisputed facts demonstrated that weisner knowingly assisted her husband in opening such accounts and in allowing him to trade under her name.
in support of its motion for summary disposition,the division offered documents from the accounts allegedly traded by brenner,deposition testimony,and sworn statements from individuals who identified brenner as the individual who traded certain accounts.the division also drew adverse inferences from the petitioners failure to answer the allegations in the complaint or to respond to the requests for admissions by asserting various privileges.the division asserted that its evidence demonstrated that brenner had traded an account opened under the name ronald boylan at first commercial financial group,the boylan account,and an account opened under his wife name at peregrine financial group the account,just eight days after the boylan account was closed the division also identified four other accounts opened in weisner name,which it alleged were actually traded by brenner 
brenner and weisner filed a joint opposition to the division motion,as well as their own motion for summary disposition.they argued that the division had failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that brenner had violated the commission trading ban.they suggested that the division evidence could be read to suggest that brenner at most used the accounts at issue to trade on foreign commodities markets,those not regulated by the commission and thus outside the scope of its ban,and that only weisner used the accounts to trade in the regulated domestic markets.brenner and weisner also objected to the division drawing adverse inferences from the assertion of their fifth amendment privilege.
in march,the alj issued his decision on the for summary disposition,finding liability on the part of both brenner and weisner and imposing sanctions pursuant to the liability determinations.the alj found that the testimony,declarations,and affidavits of the various witnesses,together with the failure of the petitioners to respond to the division discovery requests,establish ed conclusively that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.in re brenner,cftc docket,cftc lexis,at alj.the alj first noted that both marital privileges,as well as the fifth amendment privilege against,are only available in criminal proceedings.id.at citing,inter alia,ryan commissioner,cir.as for the petitioners claim that the division undisputed factual assertions fit an innocent scenario,the alj rejected that argument as an unsupported theoretical possibility insufficient to defeat summary disposition.id.at.
finding that the division had presented evidence sufficient to establish liability,and that neither brenner nor weisner had raised an issue of material fact as to the division allegations,the alj made findings of fact and six conclusions of law,ultimately holding that brenner violated section of the act and that weisner aided and abetted his actions,making her liable under section a.summary disposition was entered against brenner with respect to the boylan account,the account,and the lfg account,and against weisner with respect to the spike and lfg accounts.brenner and weisner was denied.the alj then imposed sanctions on both parties,including orders against both brenner and weisner and a civil monetary penalty of against brenner.
both the division and the petitioners appealed the decision to the full commission.brenner and weisner claimed that the record did not support the alj liability findings specifically,that the division had not rebutted the proffered innocent explanation for its factual assertions,that the alj had erroneously ruled that they could not assert their fifth amendment privilege in an administrative proceeding,and that the division withheld exculpatory evidence.the division argued that the sanctions imposed by the alj were inadequate given the nature of the violations.
in reviewing the alj initial decision,the commission first affirmed the liability determination.after noting that the alj decision was difficult to interpret,the commission stated that it was limiting its review to those allegations that were reliably resolved without a hearing that is,those issues appropriate for summary disposition.in re brenner,cftc lexis,at.it dismissed the remaining charges and vacated the alj liability findings with respect to those allegations.id.at.the commission began its analysis of the remaining claims by noting that drawing adverse inferences from the invocation of one fifth amendment privilege can not by itself support a finding of liability.it acknowledged,however,that in appropriate circumstances,such as when viewed in combination with other evidence,i t is permissible to rely on an adverse inference when respondent silence is only one of a number of factors and is given no more weight than is warranted by the record.id.at.the commission went on to review the evidence offered by the division,as well as the arguments made by brenner and weisner in opposition,and then affirmed the liability determinations against brenner with respect to the boylan account,the spike account,and the lfg account,and against weisner with respect to the lfg account.id.at.
the commission then addressed the sanctions imposed by the alj.in addition to affirming the orders,the commission felt it necessary to impose a lifetime trading ban on brenner.finally,the commission,noting the severity of the violations and its intention to deter future violations,imposed a civil monetary penalty on brenner and a civil monetary penalty on weisner.brenner and weisner timely petitioned this court for review of the commission opinion and order.
our jurisdiction to review the order from the commission derives from section c of the act,which provides in part that the federal courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction to affirm,to set aside,or modify the order of the commission,and the findings of the commission as to the facts,if supported by the weight of evidence,shall in like manner be conclusive.in reviewing an order of the commission,two standards of review are employed by this court if the question presented is of the sort that courts commonly encounter,de novo review is proper.on the other hand,if the commission decision was peculiarly within its area of expertise,we apply a deferential standard and will affirm so long as the decision is reasonable.elliott cftc,cir quotation and citations omitted.as the issues in this sufficiency of the evidence offered to support summary disposition,the existence of appellate jurisdiction,and the appropriateness of generally familiar to this court,we will employ a de novo standard of review.
liability determination 
petitioners first claim in this appeal is that there was insufficient evidence presented by the division to support the entry of summary disposition against them as to liability under sections and a of the act.they devote a significant portion of their briefs to arguing that liability must be supported by more than suspicious circumstances suggesting the mere possibility of knowing wrongdoing and that suspicion,imagination,guess work,speculation,and conjecture can not do the duty of proof.pet.br.at.no one disagrees with that proposition.the problem for brenner and weisner is that the division has alleged more than just suspicious circumstances,speculation,or record indicates that the division has offered evidence sufficient to support the commission findings of liability at the summary disposition stage.
we first note that brenner admits to violating section of the act with respect to the boylan account.see pet.br.at brenner admission regarding that account warrants a summary disposition on that account.that admission by itself is sufficient to support the commission finding of liability as to brenner.
as for the spike account,the division presented sufficient evidence to support the determination that brenner traded on domestic markets using that account.the division evidence established that in april,an account was opened at spike trading in weisner name,with her signature on account documents.the division presented trading records which established that this account was used to trade on domestic markets regulated by the commission.finally,the division offered the testimony of two spike employees who tied brenner to the spike account.we believe that this evidence was sufficient to support the commission finding that brenner traded on domestic markets through this account.
with respect to the lfg account,the division offered uncontroverted evidence that an account at lfg was opened in weisner name in may,and that the account was used to trade on domestic futures markets.the division offered the testimony of lfg employee luigi auriemma,who testified that he believed brenner traded on this account.the commission found that this evidence,considered in combination with petitioners refusal to respond to the evidence by asserting various privileges,was sufficient to establish liability.once again,neither brenner nor weisner have pointed to any factual issue with respect to this evidence.
the evidence was also sufficient to establish that weisner knew that brenner was prohibited from trading on futures markets and yet still assisted her husband in trading in violation of that prohibition.specifically,the commission presented the testimony of lfg employee auriemma,who stated that,based on his contacts with both brenner and weisner,he believed weisner was aware that brenner was trading on her account.
once the division had presented evidence to establish liability,the burden fell to the petitioners to come forward with their own evidence creating some factual dispute.the party opposing summary disposition may not rely on mere allegations,or some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,but must come forward with sufficient evidence to demonstrate a genuine dispute of material fact.see in re staryk,cftc docket,cftc lexis,at cftc,citations and quotations omitted emphasis added.the petitioners have failed to offer any evidence that would create an issue as to the validity of the division case.their response amounts to little more than calling attention to potential weak points in the division proof,coupled with their own speculation as to why it should not be believed or what innocent explanation it could support.but a party opposing summary judgment must do more than simply point to weaknesses in the movant case or raise some metaphysical doubt as to the evidence must affirmatively raise an issue of material fact.
though we take the evidence in a light most favorable to the petitioners,we believe that the evidence offered by the division,combined with the petitioners failure to respond to that evidence by invoking various privileges,see daniels pipefitters ass local union,cir t he fifth amendment does not forbid inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.quoting baxter palmigiano,d,is sufficient to support the findings of liability made by the commission.the petitioners failed to raise any issue of material fact with respect to this evidence therefore,summary disposition on the issue of liability was appropriate.
jurisdiction over the appeal of the sanctions order 
brenner and weisner next argue that neither the commission nor this court had jurisdiction to hear the division appeal of the alj sanction order,due to the division failure to file an effective notice of appeal.our analysis of this argument requires a brief recounting of the timing of events following the alj issuance of his initial decision.the alj issued that initial decision on march,but on april,issued an order of correction modifying the initial decision.both the petitioners and the division filed notices of appeal on april,noted above,the petitioners sought review of the alj liability determination,while the division challenged the adequacy of the sanctions imposed.in a
