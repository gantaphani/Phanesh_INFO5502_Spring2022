appellant gray clare appeals from an august,order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york kaplan,holding him in contempt of court.see osrecovery,v.one groupe int l,civ.lak,wl,dist.lexis.the court issued the order in response to a motion from,latvian economic commercial bank lateko,requesting that the court hold clare in contempt for his failure to comply with a january,order compelling clare to respond to lateko discovery requests.see id.wl at,dist.lexis,at.the january,order instructed clare to respond to all of lateko requests,including document requests annexed to clare notice of deposition,requests for production,and interrogatories.clare objects to these requests,the january,order compelling discovery,and the contempt order on the basis that he is not a party to the underlying litigation,and he was not subpoenaed as a.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
all parties have agreed and asserted to this court that clare is not actually a party.the district court,while also acknowledging clare status,treated clare as a only for discovery using two theoretical devices estoppel and party by proxy.
we first hold that we have jurisdiction over the instant appeal because it is final within the meaning of.although appeals from civil contempt orders issued against parties are not final and thus not immediately appealable,such appeals by are final.see int l bus.machs.united states,cir.because clare is in fact a,the appeal from his contempt order is properly appealable at this juncture.
we next hold that the district court abused its discretion by issuing a contempt order to a for failing to respond to discovery requests propounded to him as a party without providing sufficient legal authority or explanation for treating him as a party solely for the purposes of discovery.are entitled to certain discovery procedures,such as receiving a subpoena,before they are compelled to produce documents.see.c.the district court,however,permitted lateko to treat clare as a party,thereby eliminating some of the procedural protections that would have been afforded to clare had he been dealt with as a.we offer no opinion on whether the district court theories for proceeding in this manner were appropriate in the instant case because we find that the contempt order applying these theories did not lend itself to meaningful review by this court and therefore must be vacated solely on that basis.
we therefore vacate the order of the district court holding clare in contempt of court and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.
background 
osrecovery,and a number of plaintiffs who have been referred to as numbered doe plaintiffs throughout the litigation collectively,plaintiffs brought suit against defendants,including lateko,for,inter alia,violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et,alleging that defendants were engaged in a ponzi scheme to defraud investors.the doe plaintiffs identities were kept under seal and confidential,so that neither the district court at one which individuals were doe plaintiffs.it is this unusual circumstance that created much of the confusion that gave rise to the instant appeal.
at the time the action was filed,clare was president of osrecovery,a corporation formed for the purposes of bringing the underlying action.clare was also the sole shareholder of osrecovery.he was not,however,a plaintiff individually named in the action,and,as ultimately became apparent,he was not one of the doe plaintiffs either.
because the identities of the doe plaintiffs were unknown to the district court and to lateko,much confusion arose regarding whether clare was actually one of the doe plaintiffs.this confusion created issues during discovery regarding the appropriate procedure for propounding discovery requests to clare.clare contributed to this confusion by initially referring to himself as a plaintiff.for instance,in a letter sent to the district court and dated may,plaintiffs counsel requested that the court take action on behalf of one of the plaintiffs,the president of osrecovery,clare.
in clare brief,he argues that he initially referred to himself as a plaintiff because he was attempting to become one,but his efforts were rejected by the district court.according to clare,a motion was filed on april,to amend the complaint,which would have,inter alia,added clare as one of the doe plaintiffs.but,on may,the district court denied the motion to amend the complaint.clare suggests that it was at this point that he realized he would not have an opportunity to become a plaintiff.despite this supposed realization,however,on may,two weeks after the court denial counsel sent the letter to the court in which clare was characterized as one of the plaintiffs.
allegedly unsure of clare party status,lateko propounded numerous discovery requests to clare as if he were a plaintiff.osrecovery and the doe plaintiffs objected to these requests on clare behalf.notably,their objections did not include a claim that the requests were not properly propounded to clare under the rules pertaining to.clare concedes that plaintiffs counsel erred in neglecting to raise his status as an objection,but he claims that this omission occurred because counsel anticipated that clare would ultimately become a plaintiff,given that the motion to amend the complaint to add clare as a plaintiff had not yet been rejected at this point.
on january,the district court issued an order compelling clare to respond in full to lateko discovery requests by answering the interrogatories and turning over the requested documents,and on february,the court denied clare motion to reconsider its decision.in its order denying clare motion for reconsideration,the court addressed clare contention that he was not a party to the underlying litigation.the court explained that w hile it appears that all now agree that gray clare is not in fact a plaintiff in this case the fact remains that his attorneys repeatedly referred to him as a plaintiff and lateko relied upon those references in the unique circumstances here,in which the names of the individual plaintiffs have been filed under seal.because of this,the court determined that clare was estopped to deny,at least for the purposes of amenability to party discovery,that he is a plaintiff.the court rejected clare argument that counsel had referred to clare as a plaintiff because there was confusion over whether he was one.according to the court,plaintiffs counsel,who were also clare counsel,plainly knew who their clients were.
subsequently,lateko filed a motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint.on august,the district court partially granted lateko summary judgment motion,dismissing some of the doe plaintiffs and osrecovery from the litigation.with osrecovery no longer a plaintiff,the only plaintiffs remaining were the doe plaintiffs who were not dismissed from the lawsuit upon the court grant of lateko summary judgment motion.
maintaining that he was not a party,clare continued to refuse to comply with the january,order compelling his response to discovery,and on august,the district court issued an order holding clare in contempt.see osrecovery,civ.lak,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the order decrees that gray shall be fined for each day,commencing on august,that he fails to comply with the january,order.id.wl,at dist.lexis,at.it also directs that clare be arrested wherever in the united states and its possessions he may be found,transported to an appropriate detention facility in the district,and there held pending further order of the district court,which will be forthcoming when clare demonstrates that he has complied fully with the january,order.id.internal citation omitted.
in the order,the court addresses clare contention that he is not a party to the underlying litigation and therefore should not be compelled to respond to the discovery requests.see id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court,again rejecting this argument,maintains its position that clare is estopped to deny,for discovery purposes,that he is not a party.id.additionally,the court finds that clar
