richard guillemin purports to appeal from the judgment of dismissal of his that the trial court entered after sustaining the demurrer of paul stein and ray waller to the only counts of the pleading naming them as.he also appeals from two postjudgment orders awarding costs and sanctions.we shall dismiss the appeal from the judgment and from an award of discovery sanctions as untimely.we shall affirm the award of costs,but will vacate the associated sanctions.in doing so,we construe government code section as authorizing the recovery of costs for filing fees when a judgment is entered in favor of public officials acting in their official capacity.guillemin argument to the contrary is neither frivolous nor otherwise a proper basis for imposing sanctions.
the trial court entered judgment dismissing the against stein and waller on august,and they served notice of entry on guillemin the next day.days later october,guillemin filed his notice of appeal.the contend the notice of appeal is untimely.guillemin concedes the point in his reply brief,but asks by separate motion,relief to consider his late filed appeal on the grounds that the late filing was due to circumstances beyond his control.this is the entirety of his response.
guillemin had days from the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment to file his notice of appeal.rule a,cal.rules of court.not only is his invocation of unspecified circumstances beyond his control merely conclusory,it is irrelevant.the period here pertinent in which to file a notice of appeal is mandatory,and we do not have jurisdiction to consider an appeal filed even one day after it expires.hollister convalescent,rico cal d,janis california state lottery com.th,d.we must therefore deny his motion to permit consideration of notice of appeal and request for judicial notice and dismiss the appeal from the judgment without reviewing guillemin claim that he has stated a cause of action under civil code section in the eighth count of the.
before entry of the judgment dismissing the against stein and waller,the trial court granted the motion of the to compel further responses to their interrogatories and awarded sanctions of.in issuing a postjudgment order denying guillemin motion to tax costs,the trial court included a confirmation of its earlier award of discovery sanctions.
sanctions for discovery abuse are not separately appealable unless they exceed.code civ,subd.b see estrada ramirez th,d.they otherwise can be reviewed only in the appeal from the final judgment in the main action.russell general motors th,d.the order awarding discovery sanctions was thus part of the judgment in the present matter,and is beyond our review for want of a timely appeal.
it is immaterial that the trial court later confirmed its sanctions award in a postjudgment order from which there is a timely appeal.in order to be appealable,a postjudgment order must also raise an issue different from those embraced in the judgment otherwise it would give a party two chances to appeal the same ruling and thus as in the present case circumvent the time limit on appealing from the judgment.lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d.as a result,the inclusion of the award of discovery sanctions in the postjudgment order is a nullity.we will dismiss that part of the appeal from the postjudgment order.
the sole issues on which our jurisdiction is properly invoked are a cost item and in sanctions.we now turn to these issues.
the judgment of dismissal did not specify the amount of costs to which the were entitled.they subsequently filed a memorandum of costs of for fees for their first appearance.guillemin filed his notice of motion to tax this cost.he argued that neither had paid filing costs because they were governmental defendants.stein apparently was a member of the calaveras county board of supervisors,while waller was the director of the county planning department.
the opposition asserted that government code section required calaveras county to assume their defense because their actions arose out of the scope of their employment as a result,section exempted them from paying a filing fee they contended that they then were entitled under section to recover the costs as part of the judgment in order to pay the fees to the court the also moved for sanctions against guillemin and his attorney for a frivolous motion.code civ.guillemin replied that were not entitled to recover filing fees as costs because they never incurred the expense,and were individuals rather than public agencies.
in the trial court order denying the motion to tax costs,it awarded what it termed the deferred filing fees.following a subsequent hearing on the request for sanctions,the trial court also granted the motion for sanctions,awarding.in its order,the trial court stated,it was absolutely clear that authorized deferral of filing fees for public officials and that the costs claimed by cross defendants were incurred and will have to be paid to the court clerk if recovered.
section provides in pertinent part that n either the state nor any county,city,district,or other political subdivision,nor any public officer or body,acting in an official capacity,shall pay any fee for the filing of any document 
guillemin contends this statute exempts public officials from paying filing fees,thus public officials do not incur any costs in this regard.he asserts that they therefore can not recover filing fees under one of the general requirements of costs set forth in code of civil procedure section costs are allowable if incurred,whether or not paid.code civ,subd.c,italics added.
we are not persuaded.the language of section does not say the fees do not accrue.rather,it says only that the state,counties,cities,districts,political subdivisions,and public officers or bodies acting in an official capacity are exempt from payment of the fees.moreover,the argument disregards the plain language of section,which provides in pertinent part 
a whenever a judgment is recovered by a public agency named in section in any action or proceeding,which under the provisions of section no fee for any filing has been paid,the clerk entering the judgment shall include as a part of the judgment the amount of the filing fee which would have been paid but for section,designating it as such 
b when an amount equal to the clerk fees is collected upon a judgment pursuant to subdivision a,those amounts shall be due and payable to the clerk 
it is apparent that section considers the filing fees to be an existing debt that simply remains unpaid.filing fees are therefore costs incurred but not paid,which are recoverable under the general costs statute.moreover,section specifically prescribes the inclusion of these fees as costs in a judgment therefore a trial court does not have any discretion to tax them.
this leaves guillemin argument that section does not pertain to public officers such as the because the statute limits itself to judgments recovered by a public agency.guillemin is mistaken.
