the court has seen this case previously but unfortunately it is back.the litigation between these parties began in may in state court in illinois when carle clinic association clinic,a professional corporation of champaign county,illinois,filed suit against virginia huff,a widow,for payment for medical services alleged to be owing by her to the clinic in the approximate amount of,plus attorney fees and costs.the clinic was represented by the law firm of dobbins,fraker,tennant,joy perlstein,of champaign,illinois the dobbins firm.huff was initially contacted by the dobbins firm by a letter dated march,in which the firm demanded payment within days of the entire amount claimed to be outstanding.upon receipt of this letter,huff contacted her daughter,attorney deena wheeler to represent her.at that time,wheeler was serving as inhouse counsel for state farm insurance company of bloomington,illinois.the dobbins firm filed suit,and in december,the illinois circuit court entered judgment against huff for the underlying debt and about in prejudgment interest,but did not allow attorney fees.the judgment of the illinois circuit court was affirmed by the illinois appellate court in.
while the state case was proceeding,huff,in may,filed this suit in the united states district court for the central district of illinois against the dobbins firm and attorney cheryl handy,alleging violations of the fair debt collection practices act,et.fdcpa.the complaint alleged that the demand letter from the firm which was signed by attorney handy falsely represented the amount of the alleged debt.huff further alleged that,in the state court action,the firm falsely claimed a right to attorney fees huff filed her first amended complaint in november,alleging that the dobbins firm and attorney handy violated the validation requirements of by failing to give proper written notice of the debt.the first amended complaint also alleged violations of,and other unspecified subsections of.huff followed with a second amended complaint in march which repeated the counts found in the first amended complaint and added another claim based on an alleged violation of the fdcpa resulting from the dobbins firm and attorney handy contacting huff directly instead of through her attorney.on for summary judgment,the district court ruled in september in favor of the defendants on all of the issues,except whether the demand letter had complied with the validation requirement of the fdcpa set out in.that demand letter,the court held,failed to satisfy the provisions of a,which requires that a debtor be advised that he can dispute the debt and that,if the debt is disputed,the debt collector will verify the debt and provide the debtor with a copy of this verification.the district court found that the dobbins firm had failed to supply that information and had also defaulted on another requirement set out in a.
in october,wheeler filed a vague motion for a partial rehearing which the district court denied in june wheeler next sought leave to file a third amended complaint alleging yet another violation of the fdcpa,this time under b.the district court denied this request as too late.defendants sought sanctions,which were denied.during this phase of the proceedings,wheeler,attempting to establish class liability under of the fdcpa,moved for additional discovery seeking,among other things,information on every person or entity from which the dobbins firm had attempted to collect debts within a certain period.in march,the district court denied wheeler discovery motion and at the same time limited actual damages for the firm violation of the fdcpa to the period between the receipt of the law firm demand letter and the time huff was represented by counsel.another motion by huff to amend the pleadings was denied,as was the dobbins firm renewed motion for sanctions.after all this activity,only some of which is recounted above,the district court issued a firm warning to wheeler that further efforts to relitigate and pursue matters previously decided would lead to sanctions.
in a few days,however,wheeler filed a second motion for summary judgment which was stricken as redundant in april.when wheeler filed a to reconsider that latest order,the district court viewed it as an attempt to relitigate settled issues contrary to the court earlier warning,and,therefore,allowed defendants motion for sanctions.on june,sanctions were allowed in the amount of in attorney fees for having to respond to wheeler irresponsible litigation conduct.the court,on defendants motion to reconsider,reversed its prior summary judgment in favor of huff on the a notice issue and dismissed the last of huff claims for damages.the district court closed the proceedings by holding that,since all of huff claims had failed,she could not be considered successful under the fdcpa so as to be entitled to attorney fees.the first appeal to this court was then initiated by huff.
this court in considering huff initial appeal in an unpublished order dated june began with this succinct paragraph 
the issue in this case is whether a debt collector who has sent the debtor a deficient notice under the fair debt collection practices act,et.fdcpa,can avoid liability if the debtor is subsequently and very quickly represented by an attorney.we hold that the debt collector can not escape liability,but we also hold that the debtor attorney can be sanctioned for dropping a veritable blizzard of paper on the courthouse in violation of a judge order.
this court affirmed the district court on a variety of issues,reversing and remanding only on the district court last minute change of mind which had granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the a notice issue despite the fact that the firm demand letter did not meet the requirements set forth in the statute.
back in the district court,on july,huff filed a jury demand.on august,with leave of the court,the defendants filed an answer to huff second amended complaint.following that answer,huff filed a motion for default judgment as to counts ii and iii of the second amended complaint.on august,the district court struck huff jury demand as untimely.on september,the district court denied huff motion for default judgment and granted a motion by the defendants for sanctions,awarding them their attorney fees incurred in defending against the motion for default judgment.the court on remand then reconsidered huff damages for the a violation.no doubt it came as a relief to the district judge that the parties stipulated that the issue could be resolved on the pleadings as they stood without further oral argument the district court on march,held huff was entitled to compensatory damages,but because,in her first appeal to this court,huff failed to challenge a district court order limiting her damages,huff damages were limited to only those damages sustained between her receipt of the clinic faulty demand letter and the retention of her daughter as her counsel.huff sought in compensatory damages,which the court awarded without objection.furthermore,where a violation of the fdcpa is established,the plaintiff may be entitled to additional statutory damages not to exceed under a.to determine the amount of statutory damages,the court may consider the frequency and persistence of noncompliance by the debt collector,the nature of such noncompliance,and the extent to which such noncompliance was intentional.b.the district court,after considering these factors,awarded huff additional damages in the amount of.the court also awarded huff costs in the amount of to cover her filing fee,without objection by defendants.the court then turned to huff request for attorney fees and expenses totaling,including in expenses.the district court found wheeler justification for the fees and expenses in those amounts to be deficient,but allowed her in attorney fees as reasonable,after considering wheeler limited degree of success,and after excluding from the fee request excessive time charges for relatively simple claims.wheeler claim for expenses was reduced to.stricken were items that the court deemed unrecoverable,for instance,wheeler claimed e
