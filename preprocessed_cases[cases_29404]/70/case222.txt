appellant robert brunig,a texas attorney,appeals the dismissal of federal securities fraud,rico,and state law claims brought against his former client,appellee john clark,to recover legal fees clark allegedly owed him.he also appeals the imposition of rule sanctions requiring him to pay clark as the cost of defending against his suit.
in march,clark retained brunig legal services to remove liens on and restore royalty payments from clark mineral leases in anderson county,texas,termed by the parties the leases.the fee arrangement provided that brunig was to receive on a contingent basis forty percent of all monies and other payment or property including the value of all property whose title is cleared and returned to client collected.
brunig efforts on behalf of clark met with mixed success.in response to actions brought against clark by various parties seeking interests in clark leases,brunig filed suit against those plaintiffs in federal court on rico and fraud claims.the complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim by the district court,and we affirmed however,brunig did successfully clear clark land,leases,and equipment from all lien claims.for this success,brunig sought to collect a forty percent contingency fee.
contentious negotiations between brunig and clark over the fee followed.brunig wanted a quick sale of the leases from which he could collect forty percent.clark was reluctant to seek a buyer.after a significant amount of correspondence,the parties met and agreed that clark would continue to hold the leases for the foreseeable future,but brunig would receive forty percent of lease production until its sale,at which time he would receive forty percent of the sale price.
a few weeks after their agreement,clark exchanged the leases for oil and gas leases in madisonville county,texas.brunig alleges that clark employee,michael wilson represented to him that through the exchange brunig would receive a forty percent interest in the madisonville leases,that all of the leases expenses would be paid out of revenues,and that he would receive a greater return from the madisonville leases than he would have from the leases.on wilson representations,but without seeing the exchange agreement,the underlying leases,or the operating agreements,brunig consented and signed the assignment and the division order.
then,approximately one month later,brunig received a bill for purporting to cover his portion of madisonville february and march operating expenses.brunig was outraged he had not expected to have to put up cash for operating expenses.he also suspected that in exchanging the leases for the madisonville leases,clark improperly pushed two months of the expenses onto the madisonville books.brunig refused to pay the invoice,and as a result,clark sent him a notice of default.
brunig responded by suing clark,clark trust,his company,and his daughter alleging federal securities fraud and rico violations,in addition to various state law claims.the district court dismissed for failure to state a claim and imposed sanctions on brunig,who now appeals.we review the district court grant of appellees motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo 
brunig first launches procedural challenges,none of which have merit.first,brunig contends that because appellees filed an answer to his complaint before the district court had ruled on their motion to dismiss,the motion was mooted.brunig points to fed.civ.b which requires that motions to dismiss be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.the rule belies brunig point.in accordance with the rule,appellees filed their motion to dismiss before their answer and they were not obligated to wait to answer until the court had ruled on the motion.
next,brunig argues that the district court violated the doctrine by referring the motion to dismiss to a magistrate judge.this claim is meritless a judge may designate a magistrate judge to conduct hearings,including evidentiary hearings,and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition,by a judge of the court,of any motion to dismiss.relatedly,brunig contends that he did not consent to the magistrate.but the consent of the parties is not required for such a reference 
brunig also claims that the district court judge did not review the magistrate report de novo,basing this assertion on the bare fact that the district court order does not explicitly state that it conducted a de novo review.there is no evidence that the district court did not conduct a de novo review.without any evidence to the contrary,and in a case where the relevant record includes only the complaint,we will not assume that the district court did not conduct the proper review 
finally,brunig urges that the district court dismissed his case on grounds not raised in the motion to dismiss,thus depriving him of an opportunity to respond.this contention is not supported by the record.appellees motion to dismiss sought dismissal of the federal securities fraud and rico claims because the complaint failed to state a claim.the district court agreed and granted the motion.
brunig also challenges the dismissal on substantive grounds.his complaint alleged two federal securities fraud claims,one under of the securities act of and another under b of the securities exchange act of.the district court dismissed both claims for failure to plead fraud with particularity 
we address the claims separately.as to the claim,regardless of whether the complaint pleads fraud with particularity,the claim fails for a more fundamental supreme court in gustafson alloyd interpreted of the securities act to apply only to initial public offerings or sales made to the public through a prospectus.section is unavailable in a assignment such as the assignment present in this case.the dismissal of that claim is affirmed 
section b of the securities exchange act of applies more broadly,generally dealing with securities trades.rule makes it unlawful to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.our case law has distilled the regulation language into elements to state a cause of action a plaintiff must allege a misstatement or omission of material fact occurring in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,that was made with scienter and upon which the plaintiff justifiably relied,and that proximately caused injury to the plaintiff.the district court dismissed on the grounds that brunig failed to plead clark misstatements with particularity as required by the private securities litigation reform act 
while we agree with the district court that brunig complaint tends to the unartful and prolix,it does explicitly allege misstatements and omissions attributable to clark.brunig alleges that shortly after february,clark employee michael wilson informed him that as a result of the for madisonville lease exchange,brunig would receive a forty percent working interest and a twenty percent net revenues interest in the madisonville leases on which he would not be required to make any payments as the owner of a working interest,but all expenses would be paid out of revenues.brunig alleges that he relied on the proved misleading as brunig received a substantial bill for operating to the assignment in good faith based on michael wilson representations.
brunig also alleges an omission.after brunig executed the assignment for his interests,he requested and received from the madison county clerk documentation indicating that clark,in addition to the sixty percent working interest and thirty percent net revenue interest that he had informed brunig he was taking,had also taken overriding royalty interests in the madisonville leases.because overriding royalty interests reduce the amount of production available to the working interests,that clark was taking such an interest was material to brunig decision to invest in the lease.
in addition to pleading omissions
