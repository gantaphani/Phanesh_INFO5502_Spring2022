petitioner john joseph vancook,a former stockbroker,seeks review of an order of the securities and exchange commission sec or commission,which found that he willfully violated the antifraud provisions of the securities exchange act of exchange act,see b,b,by orchestrating a scheme that allowed certain customers to engage in late trading of mutual funds,and that he aided and abetted and caused the failure of his firm to keep accurate books and records,in violation of the exchange act recordkeeping requirements,see a,a a.the sec barred vancook from working in the securities industry,issued a order against him,ordered him to disgorge his unjust enrichment of plus interest,and imposed a civil penalty of.
vancook petitions this court to vacate the sec order.he argues that,although he helped select customers engage in late trading,he did not violate the exchange act antifraud provisions,because he never made misrepresentations to any victims and because late trading is not in itself fraudulent or deceptive conduct.he further argues that he could not have aided and abetted his employer recordkeeping violations because he was never aware of the illegality or wrongfulness of his employer recordkeeping practices,and because compliance was not his job.finally,vancook argues that the sec disgorgement and penalty order was unfair and disproportionate.because we conclude that vancook conduct clearly violated the exchange act antifraud and recordkeeping provisions,and because the penalties imposed by the sec were not unreasonable,we deny vancook petition and affirm the sec order.
background 
the following facts are derived from the findings of the administrative law judge alj and the sec,which are supported by substantial evidence and which we therefore must accept for purposes of this review.see a valicenti advisory,sec,cir.where vancook testimony,which the alj reasonably found lacking in credibility,differs from that of the witnesses found believable,the divergence is indicated in footnotes.
vancook has worked in the securities industry since,and since has provided brokerage services to hedge funds that trade mutual funds.in,he joined pritchard capital partners,llc pritchard capital or the firm in order to launch and manage the firm new york office and to attract new,customers to the firm.when the new york office opened in march,pritchard capital also hired elizabeth mcmahon to assist vancook in taking and executing customers orders.at that time,vancook and mcmahon were the office only employees mcmahon reported to vancook,and they worked closely together.vancook eventually purchased a percent interest in the firm,becoming a with thomas pritchard.
pritchard capital was an introducing broker that is,a firm that has the initial contact with the public customer but does not itself handle the mechanics of order entry,confirmation,clearance of trades,calculation of margin,or similar activities.katz fin.clearing servs.for the latter functions,pritchard capital contracted with a clearing broker.when vancook joined the firm,its clearing broker was bear stearns.bear stearns required the firm to fax its orders for trades by every trading day in order for fund shares to be credited with that day net asset value nav navs change daily depending on market events.late trading enables the trader to profit from market events,such as earning announcements,that occur after and consequently are not reflected in that day nav.see amendments to rules governing pricing of mut.fund shares,investment company act release,sec docket,wl,at,a late trader can exploit events occurring after,such as earnings announcements,by buying on good news and thus obtaining fund shares too cheaply or selling on bad news and thus selling at a higher price than the shares are worth.that is,the late trader who enters orders after,but nevertheless manages to secure that day nav,is able to buy,exchange,or redeem his fund shares at a nav that was calculated before the release of any information.this practice of late trading violates the forward pricing rule of sec rule.see c.
mutual funds generally are required to calculate their navs daily by eastern standard time,when the closing bell rings on the major stock exchanges.see c b sec pentagon capital mgmt.plc,d.most mutual funds disclose their nav calculation times in their prospectuses.the mutual funds traded by pritchard capital disclosed in their prospectuses that they calculated their navs at or as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange nyse,which is.according to mcmahon testimony,bear stearns deadline for receiving orders was a hard and fast rule.
late in,vancook convinced pritchard capital to change its clearing broker to banc of america securities boa,which did not have a deadline.instead,boa used a computer system,the mutual fund routing system mfrs,that allowed its customers,including pritchard capital,to enter orders up to an hour and a half after the nyse closing bell that is,up to.while still receiving that day nav.the mfrs instruction manual,a copy of which boa provided to pritchard capital,specified that 
a ll orders should be received and time stamped by the close of the nyse pm.the mfrs system allows orders that have been entered prior to pm est to be review ed until pm 
this feature of the mfrs was designed to allow brokers to review timely orders and make corrections after not to enter new orders after 
nevertheless,vancook soon began exploiting this mfrs loophole on behalf of three of the firm customers simpson capital management simpson,goodwin trading corporation goodwin,and millennium capital management millennium.in accordance with vancook instructions,these three customers would or fax vancook daily lists of proposed orders,or possible trade sheets,by vancook or mcmahon would immediately timestamp these tentative instructions,but would wait to submit any orders to boa until after they had received final instructions as to which trades the customers wanted to be executed.this procedure enabled the three favored customers to decide,after the funds navs were calculated at the close of market,whether to go ahead with the possible trades,depending on whether the trades turned out to be favorable.vancook would not record the time that a customer submitted its final instructions instead,he would enter the order into mfrs and print a screenshot of his computer monitor,which reflected the time the order had been entered into mfrs but not the time that pritchard capital had received that customer final instruction.thus,regardless of whether the firm received final order instructions prior to or afterward,the order appeared to have been received by.
vancook has stipulated that he regularly allowed simpson and goodwin to finalize trades after,that he and mcmahon took some of those calls,took the final trading orders,and that one or the other of them or another pritchard capital employee would enter them into mfrs after in order to secure that trading day nav.between november and july,vancook or pritchard capital employees acting at his behest executed nearly five thousand orders for these clients for simpson,for goodwin,and for millennium.
vancook exploitation of the mfrs loophole yielded significant profits for himself,his firm,and these three clients.his compensation increased dramatically each year he was paid in,in,and in.and although not all of his pay was connected to late trading,vancook admits that the simpson orders,in particular,accounted for a substantial portion of his commissions.in addition,vancook scheme attracted business and convinced existing customers to stay with the firm.goodwin chief,for example,testified that vancook scheme was one reason he selected pritchard capital as his company introducing broker,and that goodwin finalized probably over ninety percent of its proposed trade sheets after 
millennium,by contrast,did not originally hire pritchard capital for the purpose of engaging in late trading.at first,millennium always submitted its finalized proposed sheets to vancook by in accordance with general industry practice.eventually,however,millennium grew dissatisfied with the performance of its pritchard capital accounts.one of millennium portfolio managers,kovan pillai,testified that when he told vancook of millennium intention to close its accounts and switch to a new introducing broker,vancook informed pillai of this other business that he was doing with some other customers that was extremely profitable.
pillai testified that vancook told him that you submit the orders as you always do but before or at the latest,if you have a change of heart,if you see something happening in the business world that would change your opinion,then you were able to bust that trade.similarly,pillai assistant,scott murray,testified that vancook had told him of a method for allow ing trades to be canceled if they were no longer desirable based on information that came out between and however late the trades could be canceled.according to pillai,vancook assured him and murray that we would get the price that we normally would get from placing the order before.
millennium chose to remain with pritchard capital because of the scheme that vancook described to pillai and murray,in order to test the idea to see if it really worked.under vancook scheme,according to pillai,millennium submit ted scenarios in the middle of the day as they had always done and then sometime around they would make a decision whether they wanted to take the trade or not and would call pritchard capital with final trading instructions.
over time,vancook was confronted with numerous warnings that his scheme was improper.in january,approximately one month after millennium had begun using vancook procedure,pillai became concerned about its legality and spoke with millennium attorney,fred stone.stone told pillai that the procedure might be illegal and advised pillai to stop engaging in late trading.pillai told vancook about his conversation with stone.according to pillai testimony,vancook assured pillai that the procedure was not legally questionable,and that stone was being overly cautious and was wrong about this.vancook took pillai and murray to lunch and,according to pillai testimony,again assured them that stone was wrong and that vancook system was legal later that month,millennium ceased late trading through pritchard capital.
four months later,in may,another pritchard capital customer told vancook that it wanted legal advice regarding sec rule,which provides that 
n o registered investment company issuing any redeemable security,no person designated in such issuer prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security,and no principal underwriter of,or dealer in,any such security shall sell,redeem,or repurchase any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security.
c a.specifically,the customer wanted to know the latest time that they could enter orders each day in order to receive that day nav.at vancook request,pritchard,the majority owner and head of pritchard capital,convened a conference call with the customer to discuss the subject.on the call were vancook,pritchard,the customer,an acquaintance of that customer another operator,and pritchard capital attorney,jay seale.the conclusion reached during the call was that,although rule applied to mutual funds registered investment compan ies rather than salespersons,salespersons could nevertheless be held liable for aiding and abetting a dealer for such conduct.pritchard testified that after the call,seale told him and vancook to stick to for all orders nevertheless,even after receiving this instruction,vancook continued to execute late trades for goodwin and simpson.
in july,pritchard learned that the new york attorney general had begun an investigation into mutual fund trading practices.he testified that he subsequently began asking vancook daily whether vancook was letting people put trades in after,and that vancook repeatedly told him that he did accept trades after and had never done that at the firm.
ii.prior proceedings 
initial decision of the administrative law judge 
the sec initiated proceedings against vancook by issuing an order instituting administrative and cease and desist proceedings.vancook filed a timely response,and a hearing before an alj was held april.at the hearing,vancook admitted that he frequently allowed goodwin and simpson to call in with their final trading orders after,and he did not deny that he allowed millennium to do the same.however,in a written submission to the alj,vancook insisted that he believed the procedure he had followed with these customers timestamping their proposed trading sheets at the time of receipt,even if final orders came in after would have satisfied any rule.vancook also insisted that he was unaware his activities were improper at the time he engaged in them.when asked at the hearing when he learned of rule requirements regarding the calculation of mutual funds navs,vancook testified i do know when i knew that.i sure sometime in august or september of it was made very clear to me.
the alj found vancook claims not credible.see pritchard capital partners,llc,exchange act release,sec docket,wl alj july,initial decision.the alj noted that vancook had been a part of numerous conversations that informed him the late trading scheme was illegal,id.at that his testimony was deliberately vague,id.at that the contrary testimony from goodwin,pillai,and murray was detailed and believable,and that,given vancook background in the securities industry and his extensive experience working with market timing mutual funds,he must have known when the mutual funds navs were calculated and understood the application of rule pricing requirements to mutual fund trades,id.at.
the alj issued an initial decision in favor of the sec division of enforcement,ruling that vancook conduct constituted a scheme to defraud banc of america,and its mutual fund clients and their shareholders,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities within the meaning of exchange act section b and rule.id.at.the alj further concluded that vancook had aided and abetted and willfully caused pritchard capital violations of the recordkeeping provisions in section a of the securities exchange act,and rule a thereunder,by failing to record telephonic trade orders that he received after id.at.
the alj imposed a order against future and recordkeeping violations,and barred vancook from association with any broker or dealer or investment company.id.at.in addition,the alj ordered vancook to disgorge the portion of his total compensation received from late trading between march and july,an amount the alj determined to be,plus prejudgment interest.id.at.the alj also ordered vancook to pay a civil penalty because vancook violations involve d fraud and disregard for the regulatory requirement,created a significant risk of substantial loss to other persons,and resulted in significant pecuniary gains to vancook.id.at.
opinion of the sec 
vancook petitioned the sec for review of the alj decision.the sec agreed with the alj that vancook violated section b,rule,section a,and rule a.the sec disagreed with the alj only as to the calculation of disgorgement the sec concluded that the alj disgorgement figure should be reduced to more closely align the figure with the approximate frequency of late trading in which goodwin admittedly engaged.joseph john vancook,exchange act release a,sec docket,wl,at.the sec recalculation reduced the amount of disgorgement by ten percent of the value of the fees received by vancook from goodwin to,plus prejudgment interest.id.at.
pursuant to a,vancook now asks us to vacate the sec decision.
discussion 
standard of review 
as noted above,we will affirm the sec findings of fact if supported by substantial evidence.see valicenti advisory,at a,a.we will set aside the sec action,findings,and conclusions of law only if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.see also sec,cir.we will not disturb the sec choice of sanction unless it is unwarranted in law or without justification in fact.butz glover livestock comm,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
ii.section b and rule 
section b of the exchange act,b,and rule promulgated thereunder,are among the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws that prohibit the use of fraudulently misleading representations in the purchase or sale of securities.sec parklane hosiery,cir.section b prohibits,inter alia,the use in connection with the purchase or sale of any security of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe.b.rule makes it 
unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,a to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
b.to establish a violation of section b and rule,the sec must 
prove that in connection with the purchase or sale of a security the defendant,acting with scienter,made a material misrepresentation or a material omission if the defendant had a duty to speak or used a fraudulent device.scienter,as used in connection with the securities fraud statutes,means intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud or at least knowing misconduct.whether or not a given intent existed,is,of course,a question of fact.
sec first jersey,cir citations omitted.the supreme court has directed lower courts to interpret section b and rule flexibly and broadly,rather than technically or restrictively.sec zandford,internal quotation marks omitted.section b was designed as a clause to prevent fraudulent practices,chiarella united states,including not just garden type variet ies of fraud but also unique form s of deception involving n ovel or atypical methods,superintendent of ins.bankers life cas,internal quotation marks omitted.
we have no trouble concluding that vancook scheme constituted a device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,in violation of subsection a of rule that,by designing and operating his scheme,and by taking numerous steps to hide it,vancook made material,untrue statements and omissions,in violation of subsection b and that his actions operate d as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,in violation of subsection c.b.we further agree with the sec conclusion that vancook submission of orders constituted an implied misrepresentation because it suggested that final orders were received before the funds pricing time,as reflected in the applicable prospectus language,when,in fact,the trading decisions were made after.the mutual funds therefore were deceived into thinking that the trades were made before and into giving the trades that day nav.vancook,wl,at.
vancook contests the sec conclusion concerning rule that in his words the mere transmission of trade orders to boa after,without more,deceived mutual funds into believing that vancook had received the trade orders before he further argues that he never deceived or made misrepresentations to anyone,and was merely associated with the scheme.he contends that his role in the scheme is therefore insufficient to establish rule liability.these arguments are wholly unavailing.vancook understates his role in the scheme,mischaracterizes the sec factual findings,and misinterprets the relevant law.
the sec plainly did not find rule liability solely on the basis of mere transmission of trade orders after,as vancook claims.on the contrary,the commission found that vancook had engaged in numerous deceptive acts in furtherance of the deceptive scheme.vancook,wl,at.examples of vancook deceptive acts cited by the sec in its opinion include his secur ing a new clearing broker for pritchard capital partners knowing that its order entry system,mfrs,provided an opportunity to place orders after and still receive that day nav,unlike the firm previous clearing broker his use of trade sheets to disguise the fact that his customers made trading decisions after the close of trading and his false assurances to pritchard that he had not been allowing customers to place orders after and had never done so.id.at.
furthermore,vancook was not m erely associated with the scheme,as he asserts he was its architect.as the sec found,vancook was intimately involved with the creation,marketing,and implementation of the system that enabled simpson,goodwin,and millennium to late trade,and he communicated his deceptive acts to the mutual funds at issue by submitting orders to them through boa.id.at.this is far more than association with a deceptive scheme.as the commission made clear in its opinion,vancook engage d in acts that were directly linked to the deception practiced upon the mutual funds.id.
vancook cites united states finnerty,cir,for his proposition that merely communicating a trade order,without more,is not a communicative act that can support a finding of deceptive misrepresentation or omission under the securities laws.vancook reliance on finnerty is misplaced.first,as the alj and sec explained in great detail,vancook did not merely communicat e trade order s,but rather took a series of actions over several years to implement a scheme that he devised,as discussed above.
second,finnerty is clearly distinguishable,on its facts and its reasoning,from the present case.the criminal defendant in finnerty was a specialist on the floor of the nyse whose job was to match executable orders from public customers he was accused of trading for his own proprietary account and generating profits for himself.the government argued that because this type of trading,known as interpositioning,violated nyse rules,finnerty had also violated section b,because his customers had expected finnerty to abide by those rules and finnerty had implicitly misled them.we concluded that there was no evidence in the record that,through his interpositioning,finnerty had conveyed an impression that was misleading to his victims.id.at.we noted that the government had identified no way in which finnerty communicated anything to his customers,let alone anything false.id.at.it was not sufficient that the customers might have expected that finnerty would not engage in interpositioning simply because nyse rules prohibit the practice we held that unless the customers understanding was based on a statement or conduct by finnerty,he did not commit a primary violation of section b.id.at.
in the present case,by contrast,vancook did not merely violate an nyse rule that customers might or might not have expected him to follow he violated the mutual funds own express wishes,as set out in their prospectuses,that trades would be executed by in order to receive that day nav.vancook took steps to make it appear to any outside observer even after an examination of pritchard capital internal records that his customers buy and sell orders had been finalized by,when in fact the critical decisions were not made until well after the close of market.
furthermore,finnerty did not involve an allegation of a violation of subsection b of rule,id.at,whereas the present case does involve such an allegation along with allegations that vancook violated subsections a and c.subsection b provides that it is unlawful for covered persons t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.b.the sec argues that vancook scheme violated this provision because it constituted an implied representation to mutual funds that,because their orders received the current day nav,the orders must have been entered by.as the commission brief points out,in finnerty we did not have the opportunity to consider th
