kevin trudeau was before us last year,on appeal from a district judge order finding him in contempt of court,fining him nearly million,and barring him from appearing in any infomercials for three years.we found that the district judge properly held him in civil contempt he had violated the terms of a consent order barring him from misrepresenting the content of any of his books on tv but remanded the case so that the penalty he incurred for his contempt conformed with the requirements of civil contempt.ftc trudeau,cir.we expressed no opinion on what his penalty should be but entrusted it to the sound judgment of the district court.
trudeau is before us again.this time he been sentenced to thirty days in jail after he was found in direct criminal contempt of court for his conduct during the civil contempt proceedings.we discussed the difference between civil and criminal contempt in our prior opinion in this case,id.at.trudeau,it seems,exhorted his devoted radio audience to send on his behalf directly to the court address of the district judge presiding over his case he posted the radio broadcast on his web site,and followed it up with an blast asking his list to send to the judge.the district judge had not asked for any letters and the judge had not he thought made his address publicly available it turns out northwestern university law school had listed it on its web site the judge is an adjunct professor there.he was,therefore,surprised to see after come pouring into his inbox.he was also nervous.most of the were polite and enthusiastic if loving the values kevin trudeau creates for society is wrong,i do wan na be right,but some had threatening overtones leave kevin and his right to free spach alone.i wish carma on your soul this very moment.may god touch you today.sic throughout and more people than you know are keeping a close eye on this case,not just the special interests who will benefit from kevin silence,but regular people.we know that if he can be persecuted,so can we.we are awake to the tyranny slowly and quietly creeping into our society.we are watching.the judge alerted the marshal to the coming to his account,and the marshal performed a threat assessment to determine whether the judge was in danger.the judge received over within a span of or so hours.
once the judge began to understand that all these were arriving at trudeau behest,he summoned trudeau lawyer and the lawyer for the ftc into court the next morning without explaining why.at that morning session,the judge notified trudeau counsel that trudeau could be facing a criminal contempt sanction and ordered trudeau to appear that afternoon.he also instructed trudeau counsel to have trudeau make the stop.before he showed up later that day,trudeau sent an to his listeners asking them to cease the judge.still,the judge summarily found trudeau guilty of criminal contempt and,a week later,imposed the sentence.on trudeau motion we stayed the execution of the sentence and expedited his appeal.the ftc officially took no position on the criminal contempt judgment,and deferred to the united states attorney,who also did not take a position.we,therefore,appointed an amicus to argue on behalf of the contempt judgment we now consider whether trudeau summary punishment for direct criminal contempt was a proper exercise of the district court authority.
trudeau argues that his conviction is defective on both substantive and procedural grounds,and he does so in that order.substantively,he contends that his conduct was not contemptuous,not punishable under the criminal contempt statute,and that it was protected under the first amendment.procedurally,he disputes the judge use of a summary procedure to convict him of contempt.he also questions the reasonableness of his sentence in the event that his challenges to the conviction fail.we think it makes the most sense to address the procedural aspects of the contempt conviction first because by the very nature of a summary proceeding at the district court,the record before us is rather sparse.a more complete record would be more appropriate for the full consideration of his substantive arguments.as you will see,trudeau substantive concerns will,for the most part,require further development.

a finding of direct contempt is appropriate only if the criminal contempt occurred in the presence of the judge and the judge saw or heard the contemptuous conduct and so certifies.b.contempt in the presence of the court must be punished on the spot to maintain the court authority.mann hendrian,cir.the use of the summary contempt power is proper only for charges of misconduct,in open court,in the presence of the judge,which disturbs the court business,where all of the essential elements of the misconduct are under the eye of the court,are actually observed by the court,and where immediate punishment is essential to prevent demoralization of the court authority before the public.pounders watson,per curiam quoting in re oliver.
the fundamental principle in contempt cases is that the court must exercise the least possible power to the end proposed.united states moschiano,cir citing united states wilson,see also anderson dunn.as applied to the direct contempt context,the least possible power principle instructs that summary disposition is proper only when the express requirements of the rule are met and when there is a compelling reason for an immediate remedy or time is of the essence.moschiano,at see in re jafree,cir requiring that there be both a compelling reason for an immediate remedy and time is of the essence.if the literal requirements of the summary disposition rule are met,we review the district judge decision to impose it for an abuse of discretion.moschiano,at.if there is an explicit determination that there was a compelling need for an immediate remedy,we shall give appropriate deference to that finding.id.at.but,in light of the serious potential for abuse of the summary contempt power we emphasize the special duty of an appellate court to give careful and meticulous consideration to the trial court decision that summary disposition is appropriate.id.
