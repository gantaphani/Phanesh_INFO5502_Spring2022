the securities and exchange commission commission sanctioned christopher lowry for failing to report to the commission and inform investors of a personal loan his company made to him.lowry appeals that decision.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm.
lowry,a registered investment advisor,owned and operated lowry investors services,also known as advisors.in,lowry developed a business idea to provide investment advisory,educational,and administration services to k plans by aggregating smaller k plans.he named this new company k university,and lowry,as ceo,designated himself dean of students.several of lowry existing clients invested in his new company.lowry,however,failed to establish a separate bank account for k university and commingled the investment funds for k university in advisors bank account.
in,lowry intertwined his business and personal affairs.in order to accelerate acquisition of a home,lowry used investors funds to finance his home purchase.in august,lowry approached client phillip allen about extending a loan to,or investing in,k university lowry proposed that k university would pay allen a return for a loan.for security,lowry offered certain real estate.however,lowry did not tell allen that the real estate would be lowry future home and that he planned to use allen loan to finance it.lowry wrote the loan agreement,included the security arrangements,and sent it to allen.
lowry further blurred distinctions between himself and his businesses by closing the home purchase with funds from advisors bank account derived from k university stock sale.lowry plan to use the proceeds from the allen loan to k university to close his home purchase fizzled because the closing date arrived before he acquired the loan proceeds from allen.to document his withdrawal of funds from advisors account,lowry executed a promissory note for to be paid to fountainhead,also known as k university.however,lowry did not disclose this transaction to either company shareholders nor to the commission.he claims he did not know disclosure was required.
soon after lowry closed the home purchase,the sec investigated and intervened in the management of lowry companies.the commission notified him that it planned to inspect the companies and,in december,the commission served lowry with subpoenas for the production of documents and for his testimony.lowry hired an attorney for the company.on february,the commission obtained an ex parte order from federal district court freezing lowry and k university assets.the commission also placed a lien on lowry home.the commission intervention aborted lowry efforts to secure the allen loan or a conventional loan for his home.the assets remained frozen for the next ten months.following the entry of the order freezing the assets,lowry hired a lawyer to represent him personally.
during the pendency of the investigation,lowry maintained good communication and relations with his companies investors.lowry met with individual shareholders in the early months of.he attended a shareholder meeting in may and gave the shareholders copies of the commission complaint,the motion papers for the injunction,and his financial disclosure statements.he apologized to the shareholders for his failure to make full disclosures sooner.the shareholders continued to be separately represented by counsel,and they ratified the house loan to lowry.lowry later repaid the individual investors of k university pursuant to the agreement with the commission.for the most part,the investors then reinvested the funds in the corporation.
the commission pursued both judicial and administrative remedies against lowry.the judicial proceedings against lowry culminated with the district court december,stipulated order.as part of the stipulation,lowry neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the complaint,but agreed not to deny the allegations of the complaint.the court order further enjoined lowry from violating federal securities laws.on january,lowry moved for an independent order for disgorgement,and the court entered that order on january.that order released the lien on lowry home,and he was able to obtain a mortgage.
a few weeks after the court stipulated order,the commission began an administrative proceeding to sanction lowry.following a hearing on april,a commission administrative law judge issued an initial decision on september,barring lowry from associating with an investment adviser.lowry petitioned the commission for review,and the commission issued its order affirming the decision on august.lowry now appeals the commission decision,claiming that it is too harsh.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,lowry raises three arguments.first,he argues that the sanctions the commission that of being barred from associating with an investment unwarranted when applying the factors created by the fifth circuit in steadman sec,cir.second,lowry argues that the sanctions are disproportionate to those assessed in other cases.finally,lowry argues that the commission made factual errors and unsupported findings on which the sanctions were based.
standard of review 
the commission choice of sanctions is reviewed for a gross abuse of discretion.kane sec,cir.the commission findings of fact must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence.lowell listrom sec,cir.this court gives conclusive effect to the factual finding of the commission if those findings are supported by substantial evidence.stephen investment securities,sec,cir.the choice of sanction may not be overturned unless we find it unwarranted in law or without justification in fact kane,at quoting butz glover livestock comm,d see also american power light sec.
on judicial review,an agency interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deference when the interpretation is consistent with the language of the authorizing statute and the purpose of the regulation.listrom,at see also united states larionoff,d.the court role is to decide only whether,under the applicable statute and the facts,the agency made an allowable judgment in its choice of the remedy.steadman,at quoting jacob siegel ftc.the steadman court determined that permanent exclusion from the industry is without justification in fact unless the commission specifically articulates compelling reasons for such a sanction.id.at.
the underlying purposes of the securities laws include promoting disclosure of information,protecting the investing public,controlling fraud and manipulation in trading securities,and facilitating compliance.sec southwest coal energy,cir.
steadman factors 
the commission applied the analysis first outlined in steadman to determine the appropriate sanction for lowry misconduct.the commission analysis justified imposing the severe sanction of barring lowry from associating with an investment advisor.lowry argues that the commission misapplied steadman.we disagree.in steadman,the fifth circuit remanded a matter to the commission for further findings on a sanctions issue after determining that the commission failed to provide sufficient analysis to support the sanction.the court noted that it had not reversed the commission,but instead wanted to provide the commission with the opportunity to justify its position.to facilitate the commission analysis,the fifth circuit provided factors for the commission to consider.these factors include the egregiousness of the defendant actions the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction the degree of scienter involved the sincerity of the defendant assurances against future violations the defendant recognition of the wrongful nature of his conduct the likelihood that the defendant occupation will present opportunities for future violations 
egregiousness of actions isolated of scienter 
lowry admits error,but he contends that his conduct reflected neither egregiousness nor the high degree of scienter usually indicative of investor fraud.he asserts that he repaid the funds to k university,the investors ratified his actions and supported him thereafter,and his actions were related to only one isolated transaction.he argues that there must be something more than a bare reporting violation to
