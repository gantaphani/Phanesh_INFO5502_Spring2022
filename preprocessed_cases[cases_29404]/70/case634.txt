on summary judgment,the united states district court for the central district of california ruled that magnetar technologies,magnetar does not infringe intamin,intamin patent the patent.intamin appeals that ruling.magnetar appeals the district court order vacating a previous award of rule sanctions.upon consideration of the claim terms on appeal,this court vacates part of the district court claim construction and remands.this court also affirms the district court decision to vacate the rule sanctions.
the patent,entitled braking system for an amusement device,discloses a magnetic braking system for amusement park rides such as drop towers and roller coasters.magnetic brakes create eddy currents when a conductor passes through a gap between two sets of magnets.these eddy currents,in turn,create a magnetic friction that slows and stops the car attached to the conductor.the patent describes specific arrangements for the conductor and the magnets.figure of the patent illustrates a configuration with the adjacent magnets of opposite polarity in direct contact.the specification states that a ccording to,the polarity of the magnet elements are reversed along the direction of the carrying rail.patent.
figures and of the patent show gaps between magnet elements that are filled with spacers or intermediaries.

in one embodiment in the specification,the intermediary is.patent.
magnetar sells a magnetic braking system under the name soft stop brakes.magnetar brakes contain magnets arranged as a halbach array.a halbach array rotates the polarities of adjacent magnets by degrees,rather than by degrees as in figure of the patent.by configuring the magnets in a halbach array arrangement,magnetar brake creates a flux,meaning the configuration concentrates the magnetic force on one side of a magnet while nearly canceling out the magnetic force of the other side of a magnet.for example,the flux of a halbach array is the technology behind a refrigerator magnet that sticks on only one side.
magnetar joins the magnets into rows with epoxy,with one magnet abutting another,and places these rows of magnets into metal tubes.then magnetar attaches these magnetized tubes to the track.a conductive rail,or fin,is attached to the movable passenger car.magnetar president allegedly offered to sell magnetar brakes in a configuration with the fin on the track and the magnets on the passenger cars.
intamin sued magnetar alleging that the soft stop brakes infringe claim of the patent.claim of the patent reads 
a braking device for use with an amusement apparatus having a fixed device part,at least one running rail secured to the fixed device part,and a movable device part including at least one traveling gear configured for movement along the at least one running rail,the braking device comprising 
an eddy current brake assembly including 
a conducting part having at least one conductive rail configured for attachment to the fixed device part,said at least one conductive rail being adapted to extend the length of the fixed device part 
an energizing portion having at least one yoke aligned in correspondence with each said at least one conductive rails,each said yokes including a pair of yoke arms for receiving said at least one conductive rail there between 
at least one pair of carrying rails extending a predetermined distance along the direction of said at least one conductive rail,each said carrying rails being mounted on corresponding yoke arms of said plurality of yokes 
a plurality of magnet elements mounted on each of said carrying rails with alternating polarities,said plurality of magnet elements being further arranged such that the poles of magnet elements mounted on one carrying rail have opposite polarities from the poles of magnet elements mounted on a corresponding carrying rail of said at least one pair of carrying rails and 
an intermediary disposed between adjacent pairs of said plurality of magnet elements 
an interferric gap is defined between each said yoke arms and the at least one conductive rail,and 
movement of the movable device part,relative in the fixed device part,induces eddy currents that create a magnetic brake force between said conducting part and said energizing part.
seeking summary judgment of,magnetar asserted that its brakes did not infringe this claim because they did not include an intermediary,because they were not attached to the fixed device part,and because they did not include a conductive rail adapted to extend the length of the fixed device part.the district court agreed that magnetar brakes did not contain an intermediary.intamin,magnetar techs,sa cv,slip op.at,initial decision.the district court further found that magnetar brakes could not infringe,either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents,the limitation requiring attachment to the fixed device part.id.at.finally,the district court also determined that magnetar soft stop brakes did not infringe literally a limitation requiring the conductive rail to extend the length of the fixed device part.id.at.the district court opined that magnetar soft stop brakes may infringe this limitation under the doctrine of equivalents but did not reach that issue because the absence of other limitations already showed that magnetar brakes did not infringe the patent.id.at.thus the district court granted summary judgment of.id.
magnetar also alleged that intamin complaint violated rule b.magnetar argued that intamin filed its complaint as retaliation for magnetar president public criticism of intamin brakes.magnetar also argued that intamin complaint was frivolous.intamin responded that its law suit was not retaliatory and was adequately supported by investigations.initially,the district court granted rule sanctions.id.at.upon reconsideration,the district court affirmed its finding that intamin filed the complaint for an improper purpose but vacated its decision that intamin investigation was frivolous.intamin,magnetar techs,sa cv,slip op.at.march,reconsideration decision.magnetar then moved for attorneys fees.intamin,magnetar techs,sa cv,slip op.at,fee decision.in opposition to magnetar motion for attorneys fees,intamin argued that,under ninth circuit law,a meritorious complaint can not have an improper purpose.id.as such,intamin argued that the district court could no longer award sanctions.id.the district court agreed and vacated its sanctions.id.at.

this court reviews a grant of summary judgment without deference.ethicon,surgical.on appeal,the parties dispute the district court construction of the claim limitation requiring an intermediary disposed between adjacent pairs of said plurality of magnets.the parties also dispute the district court claim construction of a second limitation found in claim of the patent said at least one conductive rail being adapted to extend the length of the fixed device part.like summary judgment itself,this court reviews claim construction without deference.cybor fas techs,en banc.
regarding the limitation requiring an intermediary,the dispute rests on whether the intermediary between adjacent pairs of magnets can itself be a magnet.the use of the word said in a claim refers to an earlier use of the term in the claim.see bell commc research,vitalink commc.here,the claim proceeds from the following definition a plurality of magnet elements mounted on each of said carrying rails with alternating polarities,said plurality of magnet elements being further arranged such that the poles of magnet elements mounted on one carrying rail have opposite polarities from the poles of magnetic elements mounted on a corresponding carrying rail of said at least one pair of carrying rails.patent.thus,according to claim,the magnets surrounding the intermediary have at least alternating polarities.
intamin argues that adjacent pairs of magnets with alternating polarities must mean two magnets on the same rail with opposite polarity,as shown in figure of the patent.thus,according to intamin,anything between the magnets of opposite polarity is an intermediary,whether magnetic or not.magnetar argues that adjacent pairs of magnets means any two magnets next to each other or abutting each other on the rail,as shown in figure.further,according to magnetar,the term alternating does not require that such magnets have opposite polarity as shown in figure.thus,because adjacent magnets are any two magnets abutting each other on a single rail,magnetar argues that another magnet can not be an intermediary.under its interpretation,magnetar soft stop brakes would not infringe claim because they lack an intermediary.
the district court construed the term intermediary without determining the meaning of adjacent magnets with alternating polarities.the parties disagree therefore about the meaning the district court actually gave to the term intermediary.intamin argues that the district court determined that the intermediary could not be magnetic,thus precluding infringement.magnetar disagrees that the district court made such a determination.
in any event,the parties agree that this court can not interpret intermediary without addressing the polarities of the adjacent magnets.specifically,an intermediary can not be another magnet if this court construes adjacent pairs of magnets as two magnets abutting each other with polarities that alternate at some degree such as found in a halbach array.in other words,an intermediary can only be a magnet if the limitation alternating polarities means opposite polarities.under that interpretation,some magnets become adjacent pairs and other magnets in between become intermediaries.in addition,adjacent pairs of magnets with opposite polarities,as in figure,would need some separation intamin argues that another magnet can provide this separation.
the district court adopted magnetar proposed claim construction in short,ordinary meaning supports defendant construction,and neither the specification nor the prosecution history changes the ordinary meaning.initial decision,slip op.at.on its face,the district court construed the term intermediary to mean a member between others.id.at.in reaching that conclusion,the district court dismissed intamin proposed claim construction that the intermediary can be a magnet between two other magnets.id.in fact,the trial court specifically points to language in the patent that the intermediary is.id.thus,the district court apparently construed the term intermediary to mean something between the adjacent magnets.
the first step in an infringement analysis is the determination of the scope of the claims.markman westview instruments,aff,d.this court construes claims according to the principles set forth by this court in phillips awh,en banc.as such,the court consults primarily the claims themselves in context,with much of that context supplied by the specification and the prosecution history.id.at.
in this case,the claim language itself does not require a intermediary.just as in the phillips case itself,the claim uses a broad term with an understandable meaning.as the district court noted,the term intermediary standing alone means a member between others.initial decision,slip.this term takes on additional meaning,however,in the context of magnetized members.the context of the rest of the patent helps show that additional meaning,namely whether the intermediary may be magnetic.
in phillips,this court noted that dependent claims can supply additional context for construing the scope of the independent claims associated with those dependent claims.at.an independent claim impliedly embraces more subject matter than its narrower dependent claim.in this case,dependent claim modifies the term intermediary.claim of the patent discloses t he braking device of claim wherein said intermediary is.this dependent claim shows both that the claim drafter perceived a distinction between magnetic and intermediaries and that independent claim impliedly embraced magnetic intermediaries.see water,safari water filtration.
the district court initially did not consider the context supplied by claim differentiation because intamin did not raise this argument until reconsideration.reconsideration decision,slip op.at.even without the enlightenment supplied by claim differentiation,however,the overall context of claim does not limit the broad language to intermediaries.at one point,the patent describes an embodiment of the invention with a intermediary.patent.the district court seized on this disclosure to limit the term intermediary to nonmagnetic substances only.initial decision,slip op.at.as this court has repeatedly noted,see sri int l matsushita electric,en banc plurality opinion,a narrow disclosure in the specification does not necessarily limit broader claim language.phillips,at.the overall context of the patent,in this case,does not specifically disavow magnetic intermediaries.see,scimed life.advanced cardiovascular systems.the single reference does not expressly limit the entire invention but only describes a single embodiment.moreover,the term intermediary,like the term baffle in phillips,embraces more than the limited specification disclosure.
thus,this court finds that the term intermediary can embrace magnetic substances,albeit only if the additional term requirement of alternating polarity allows for it.accordingly,this court vacates the district court construction of this term.however,this court has not reached an additional question on which the trial court has yet to provide a decision for review.specifically this court remands to permit the district court to determine whether the patent limits the term adjacent magnets of alternating polarity to magnets of opposite polarity.with the understanding that an intermediary may be magnetic,the trial court may revisit its finding of.
the district court also construed the limitation of a conductive rail being adapted to extend the length of the fixed device part to mean the conductive rail must run the end length of the track to which it is attached.initial decision,slip op.at.specifically,the district court construed the term length to mean extent from end to from width.id.in other words,the district court applied the ordinary meaning to the term length and found that the plain meaning of the term referred to the full length of the fixed device part.id.at.in the patent roller coaster embodiment,this limitation would require the conductive rail to extend the entire length of the roller coaster.
in the claim,the fixed device part refers to the framework of the amusement device,the track for the roller coaster or tower drop.the conductive rail refers to a metal rail,part of which will have a conductive coating.the rail and the coating make up the conductive part.this conductive part,in turn,passes through the array of magnets to generate the braking force or vice versa,depending on the configuration.this court must determine the meaning of length as a reference to the full length of the fixed device part,as the district court construed,or to the direction or orientation of the conductive rail.
the claim language uses the term length in the context of a longer phrase adapted to extend the length of the fixed device part.the verb extend already suggests that the length reaches from one end to another.moreover,the term length imparts information about the fixed device part,once again suggesting that the length will encompass the entire dimensions of that structure.in sum,the claim term length in context in the claim encompasses the full length of the fixed device part,as the district court correctly discerned.
the district court further recognized that the specification nowhere uses length to refer to direction or orientation.initial decision,slip op.at.rather,the district court found correctly that the term referred to the entire length of the fixed device part.id.at.the patent specification uses length
