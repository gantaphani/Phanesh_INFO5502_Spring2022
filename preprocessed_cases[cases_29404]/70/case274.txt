sean bledsoe relator appeals from an order entered by the district court on september.relator had brought a qui tam action against defendants community health systems,chs and sparta hospital corporation white county community hospital white county hospital,alleging violations of the false claims act fca,et.the district court entered an order in which it denied relator motion to recognize a settlement agreement reached between the united states government and chs,granted defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings,and dismissed relator claims with prejudice.
in this case involving some issues of first impression,we reverse the judgment of the district court for the reasons discussed below.
background 
procedural history 
on february,relator filed a qui tam action against chs,as well as other entities and officers of the various entities,in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia the complaint alleged that chs and others violated the fca,et,by unbundling services and billing medicare and medicaid and miscoding and upcoding items billed to medicare and medicaid.at.pursuant to b the complaint was filed under seal and served upon the united states,but the government declined to intervene in the action.relator thereafter served the complaint on the named defendants in may of.
on july,relator filed a first amended complaint amended complaint.the amended complaint deleted some defendants,added a defendant,and contained new substantive allegations.chs and white county hospital collectively defendants filed separate answers to the amended complaint.
relator case subsequently was transferred to the middle district of tennessee.defendants then filed a motion,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,for judgment on the pleadings on november.relator filed a brief in opposition to defendants motion.additionally,relator filed a motion to recognize a separate settlement agreement entered into between the government and chs,claiming that he was entitled to a relator share of the settlement proceeds.
on september,the district court filed a memorandum opinion,which granted defendants rule c motion,denied relator motion to recognize the settlement,and dismissed relator lawsuit with prejudice.an order to this effect was entered on the same day.relator timely appeal followed.
substantive facts 
relator and chs cooperation with the government 
in,relator began working at white county hospital,which is one of several hospitals owned by chs.at some point during his tenure at white county hospital,relator became aware of a serious problem with upcoding and other billing irregularities at,and he reported these irregularities to the government between and.
sometime in the fall of,chs was approached by the government about possible upcoding at two different chs hospitals.on december,chs contacted the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services,and disclosed that it had detected medical coding irregularities at its hospitals during recent internal audit efforts.chs informed of its plans to undertake an audit of its hospitals coding,disclose the results,and repay any overpayments it had received from medicare.after lengthy negotiations,chs conducted the,and it presented preliminary findings to on december.simultaneously worked with the department of justice doj to investigate whether a fca violation might have occurred.this investigation,of which relator apparently was unaware at the time,concluded in.
relator original complaint and written disclosure 
in the meantime,relator filed his qui tam action in february of.the original complaint alleged that the cookville regional medical center cookville,one of the original named defendants,perpetrated a scheme of defrauding the united states government by unbundling services and billing medicare and medicaid,and that chs and other defendants engaged in a scheme of defrauding the united states government by miscoding and upcoding items billed to medicare and medicaid.at.count one of the complaint alleged that the defendants knowingly presented,caused to be presented,or conspired to present false claims in violation of a.at.count two alleged that the defendants agreed to undermine the medicare and medicaid laws,rules,and regulations and that they conspired to defraud the government by acting collectively to submit or cause to be submitted false and fraudulent claims for payment to the united states in violation of a.at.
with the sealed complaint,relator also furnished to the government,as required,a written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information he possesse d.b.in the written disclosure,relator indicated,in pertinent part,that he had witnessed,or learned from others about,unbundling of services while working at cookville upcoding of contract services and disposable equipment,as well as fraudulent inflation of cost reports,in white county hospital nursing and respiratory departments misuse of a doctor medical provider number in the emergency room double billing and billing for unbillable items improper changing of patients statuses from an status to an inpatient status billing for fictitious continuous heart monitoring and improperly premature discharging of hospital patients when medicare reimbursement eligibility had been exhausted.in support of his allegations,relator also provided a list of hospital employees and asserted his possession of supporting documents.
c.the government and chs settlement agreement 
the government and chs ultimately agreed on a settlement in which chs would repay to the government medicare overpayments in the amount of.the original version of the settlement agreement also specifically reserved and excluded from the scope and terms of this agreement as to any entity or person including the released parties claims asserted in a qui tam action brought by another relator in the middle district of tennessee.at.relator qui tam suit was not referenced in the original version of the settlement agreement.on or about march,a revised version of the settlement agreement was circulated,including a substituted page,which included relator claim among the claims specifically excluded from the settlement agreement.all the parties then signed the revised settlement agreement.the settlement agreement effective date was may.
adams intervening lawsuit and relator amended complaint 
on january,after the government declined to intervene in relator qui tam action but before relator complaint was served on defendants,robert adams,former medical director of white county hospital geropsychiatric treatment program,filed a complaint in tennessee state court,alleging wrongful termination.specifically,he contended that he was terminated for refusing to participate in white county hospital policies regarding medicare billings,which included provid ing unneeded medical services,falsify ing patient charts,and performing other illegal and unethical activities,with the goal of producing longer patient stays and,thus,higher hospital reimbursement amounts.
after the filing of adams tennessee state court lawsuit,relator filed an amended complaint on july.the amended complaint,among other things,contained new substantive allegations,including fraud in white county hospital psychiatric unit.specifically,the amended complaint asserted that defendants had engaged in a scheme to defraud the government by admitting to the psychiatric unit patients who were not medicare or medicaid eligible.additionally,the amended complaint alleged that defendants encourag ed physicians to maximize the average length of stay in the psychiatric unit,whether medically necessary or not,and terminated robert adams as director of the psychiatric unit because he declined to increase the average length of stay of patients unnecessarily.at.the amended complaint also alleged a variety of other fraudulent medicare billing practices,including fraudulent uses of provider numbers,fraudulent billing for continuous monitoring services,improper payment of bonuses to providers based on hospital admissions,misrepresentation of the employment status of certain physicians recruited for an underserved area in order to obtain federal funds,and unbundling of various services.
e.the district court rulings 
on september,the district court granted defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.in doing so,it reasoned that relator amended complaint was required to state its fca claims with particularity,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and that the amended complaint had failed in this regard.the court then decided to dismiss relator claims with prejudice,reasoning that relator had enjoyed a sufficient time period in which he could have amended his amended complaint to comply with rule b but had failed to do so.
the district court also denied relator motion to recognize the may,settlement between the government and chs,reasoning that relator was not entitled,under any provision of the fca,to a relator share of the settlement proceeds.pursuant to these two rulings,the district court dismissed the case.
the fca,et,is an statute that prohibits the knowing submission of false or fraudulent claims to the federal government.specifically,imposes liability when a person presents,or causes to be presented,a claim for payment or approval the claim is false or fraudulent and the person acts are undertaken knowingly,with actual knowledge of the information,or with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the claim.id.a,b.section a prohibits conspiracies to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.id.a.persons who violate the fca are liable for civil penalties and double or treble damages,plus the costs incurred in bringing a fca lawsuit.id.a.
additionally,the fca allows a private individual to bring a lawsuit alleging fca violations on behalf of the government,which is known as a qui tam action.id.the private individual bringing the qui tam suit,known as a relator,must first serve the complaint upon the government,where the complaint then remains under seal for at least sixty days.id.b.during this time period,the government may elect to intervene.id.if the government does not intervene in the action,the relator may proceed with the action.id.b b,c.if the relator successfully recovers funds for the government in pursuing the qui tam action,he or she is entitled to of the proceeds recovered.id.d.however,there are restrictions upon a relator ability to proceed with a qui tam suit.for instance,
no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
id.e a.in other words,a relator may continue the qui tam suit based on information only if the relator is the original source of that information.
if the government intervenes in the action,it takes over the relator case and adopts any or all of the allegations contained in the qui tam suit.id.c.the relator,in turn,is entitled to of any proceeds of the action or settlement.id.d.additionally,the government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the government,including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty.id.c.if the government elects to pursue an alternate remedy,the relator shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the action had continued under this section.id.
on appeal,we must resolve three issues whether the district court correctly dismissed relator amended complaint with prejudice for failure to comply with federal rule of civil procedure b whether certain portions of relator amended complaint fall outside our subject matter jurisdiction because they are based upon information of which relator was not the original source and whether the district court correctly determined that relator was not entitled to a relator share of the may,settlement agreement executed between the government and chs.
we first consider whether the district court erred in granting defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissing with prejudice relator amended complaint for failing to comply with federal rule of civil procedure b.we will address this issue as a inquiry whether a complaint alleging fca violations must comply with rule b if so,whether relator amended complaint satisfied the rule b requirement and if the amended complaint did not satisfy the requirement,whether the district court properly dismissed it with prejudice.
a.a complaint alleging violations of the fca must comply with federal rule of civil procedure b.
relator argues on appeal that the district court erred in granting defendant rule c motion because a complaint stating a violation of the fca need not comply with rule b,which mandates that in all averments of fraud the circumstances constituting fraud shall be stated with particularity.b.we review de novo the district court statutory interpretation of the fca as requiring rule b compliance.united states rapanos,cir citing united states markwood,cir.
we recently held in a published case that a complaint alleging fca violations must allege the underlying facts with particularity as required by rule b.see yuhasz brush wellman,cir.therefore,the district court correctly required relator complaint to comply with rule b.
although the fca statutory language does not expressly require rule b compliance,it strongly suggests the propriety of requiring such compliance.section a imposes liability when a person knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.a emphasis added.moreover,section a prohibits a person from conspir ing to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.emphasis added.legislative history further reveals that congress views the fca a s a civil remedy designed to make the government whole for fraud losses,at,reprinted in,see also united states borstein,d noting that the purpose of the fca,when originally enacted,was to stop the massive frauds perpetrated by large contractors during the civil war.in short,i t is that the fca is an statute.gold,cir.thus,when pleading violations of the fca,a fraud statute,one necessarily makes averments of fraud and necessarily must state with particularity the circumstances constituting the fraud.b.
relator disputes our characterization of the fca as a fraud statute.he points out that rule b only applies to averments of fraud and only requires that the circumstances constituting fraud need be stated with particularity.b,whereas the fca imposes liability on a person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.a.therefore,relator observes,a complaint alleging a fca violation need only show that the person knowingly,or with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance,presented a false claim,and the fca suit is not required to prove many of the other traditional elements of fraud,such as scienter intent to defraud,actual damages to the government,or reasonable reliance by the government.relator argues that such a lowered level of intent demonstrates that the fca is not a fraud statute and,consequently,a complaint need not state its fca allegations with particularity.
we are not persuaded by the distinctions relator has drawn.the fact that the fca does not require proof of all the traditional elements of a fraud claim,such as scienter,does not mean that the fca is not an statute.congress may have had special reasons for liberalizing the level of intent needed to prove a fca violation but its unambiguous legislative intent was to combat fraud and,consequently,to hold civilly liable those persons who submit fraudulent claims.moreover,as other courts have pointed out,the fca more lenient intent requirement does not conflict with rule b,since m alice,intent,knowledge,and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.gold,at quoting.b.relator is not required to state with particularity defendant intent to defraud he is only required to state with particularity the circumstances,the time,place,and substance surrounding the fraudulent activity.see id.application of rule b is appropriate in that it would deter those alleging fca violations from making overly broad allegations.united states ex rel.lacorte smithkline beecham clinical,cir 
therefore,stating a violation of the fca constitutes an averment of fraud for purposes of rule b,and a complaint alleging such a claim must state the circumstances surrounding the fca violation with particularity.yuhasz,at.
b.the allegations of fca violations in relator amended complaint are not stated with sufficient particularity.
our review of whether the district court properly granted defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c is guided by that of a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.ziegler ibp hog market,cir citing mixon ohio,cir.thus,our review of the district court ruling is de novo.grindstaff green,cir.our inquiry is whether,based on the allegations in the amended complaint,relator can prove any set of facts that would entitle him to relief.mixon,at.in undertaking this inquiry,we will construe the amended complaint in the light most favorable to relator and accept all of its factual allegations as true.ziegler,at.
in complying with rule b,a plaintiff,at a minimum,must allege the time,place,and content of the alleged misrepresentation on which he or she relied the fraudulent scheme the fraudulent intent of the defendants and the injury resulting from the fraud.coffey foamex,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also united states ex rel.branhan mercy health of southwest ohio,wl,at cir,affirming dismissal of a complaint alleging improper billing in violation of the fca because it failed to allege a single specific incident in which improper billing occurred and the plaintiff never set forth the dates,times,or the names of individuals who engaged in the alleged improper billing.essentially,the amended complaint should provide fair notice to defendants and enable them to prepare an informed pleading responsive to the specific allegations of fraud.advocacy org.for patients providers auto club ins.ass n,cir citing michaels.ameritrust,cir.
we agree with the district court that relator amended complaint failed to state fca violations with sufficient particularity.notably,the amended complaint failed to set forth dates as to the various fca violations or any particulars as to the incidents of improper billing relator supposedly witnessed.additionally,the amended complaint did not specify the names of any individuals involved in the improper billing,save for adams,who was allegedly terminated in retaliation for refusing to engage in the fraudulent billing practices.indeed,the amended complaint often states that defendants engaged in certain practices,without ever specifying the defendants to which it was referring.a complaint may not rely upon blanket references to acts or omissions by all of the defendants,for each defendant named in the complaint is entitled to be apprised of the circumstances surrounding the fraudulent conduct with which he individually stands charged.benoay decker,internal quotation marks and citations omitted,aff,cir see also yuhasz,at holding that the complaint at issue did not comply with rule b inasmuch as it failed to identify specific parties,contracts,or fraudulent acts.based on all these deficiencies,we agree with the district court that the allegations in relator amended complaint have failed to comply with rule b.
c.the district court abused its discretion in dismissing relator amended complaint with prejudice.
relator alternatively challenges the district court decision to dismiss his amended complaint with prejudice instead of affording him an opportunity to comply with rule b by amending his amended complaint.we review a district court decision to dismiss a complaint with prejudice for an abuse of discretion.shepherd wellman,cir citing grover eli lilly,cir.we agree with relator that dismissing his amended complaint with prejudice was improper.
in eeoc ohio edison,cir,we held that where a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim,a plaintiff must be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the action with prejudice.quoting bank pitt,cir see also coffey,at observing that federal courts must be liberal in allowing parties to amend their complaints quoting hayduk lanna,cir.denial may be appropriate,however,where there is undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,futility of the amendment,morse mcwhorter,cir quoting foman davis,d.the relevant issues in our inquiry are whether relator had sufficient notice that his amended complaint was deficient,and if so,whether relator had an adequate opportunity to cure the deficiencies.
in this case,the district court declined to grant relator an opportunity to amend the complaint,reasoning that g iven the relator alleged first hand knowledge of these events and the pendency of this action for more than two years,relator has had ample opportunity to cure the cited factual deficiencies in his pleadings.at.however,we are not persuaded that relator was on sufficient notice that his amended complaint was deficient.the district court september,opinion we now review constituted its first communication to relator that he was required to satisfy rule b and he failed to satisfy it.yet this very same ruling denied relator the opportunity to correct the defects of which he had just been informed,electing instead to dismiss the amended complaint with prejudice.
defendants argue that relator was sufficiently on notice of the amended complaint defects.specifically,they point out that shortly after the original complaint had been unsealed and served upon the named defendants,defense counsel had contacted relator counsel and informed him that defendants planned to file a motion for dismissal and sanctions against relator unless relator voluntarily dismissed the complaint.among defense counsel cited reasons for dismissal was the complaint failure to state its allegations with sufficient particularity.the parties subsequently signed a stipulation to give relator time to amend his complaint.relator thereafter filed an amended complaint that included additional allegations but did not sufficiently particularize its allegations for purposes of complying with rule b.
we disagree with defendants that the communications between the parties counsel about amending the complaint to provide for more specificity constituted sufficient notice in this case.at the time relator had filed his original and amended complaints,the law was unsettled as to whether a complaint alleging fca violations needed to comply with rule b,and relator therefore was not definitively on notice that he had to state his allegations with the specificity required by rule b.indeed,his first notice that the complaint was deficient came from the district court september,opinion,which then proceeded to dismiss his case with prejudice.moreover,we do not discern from the record any undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of relator,or any undue prejudice to defendants by virtue of allowance of the amendment.morse,at quoting foman davis,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,there is some indication from the record that relator possessed additional information that could have allowed his amended complaint to allege the fca violations and other fraud allegations with sufficient particularity,specifically his disclosure to the united states government when he filed his qui tam suit.for instance,the district court opinion noted that relator failed to name any individuals who engaged in the fca violations,but in the disclosure filed with the government at the commencement of his qui tam suit relator did provide some names and asserted his possession of supporting documents and additional information.
given that federal courts must be liberal in allowing parties to amend their complaints,coffey,at citing hayduk,at,we will remand the case to the district court to allow relator to comply with rule b by amending his amended complaint.
defendants contend that even if the district court did not properly dismiss relator amended complaint with prejudice for failure to comply with rule b,relator is barred from proceeding with paragraphs of the amended complaint,pursuant to the fca public disclosure doctrine.we agree with defendants.
as discussed earlier,the fca precludes a federal court from exercising jurisdiction over allegations in a qui tam suit that are based upon information,unless the relator is the original source of that information.e a.thus,we must determine the following whether there was a public disclosure,whether paragraphs of relator amended complaint were based upon that public disclosure,and whether relator was an original source of the information.
there is little doubt that adams complaint,filed in tennessee state court,qualifies as a public disclosure.see united states ex rel.mckenzie bellsouth,cir public disclosure also includes documents that have been filed with a court,such as a plaintiff complaint.
furthermore,relator amended complaint was based upon information publicly disclosed in adams complaint.it is true that paragraphs of the amended complaint were not wholly copied from adams complaint.indeed,only part of the fraud in the psychiatric unit section of relator amended complaint appears to have been borrowed from adams complaint.most notably,paragraphs,and of the amended complaint,which discussed the deliberate lengthening of patient stays in the psychiatric unit,appear to parallel adams allegations.relator does allege other fraudulent activity in the psychiatric unit not discussed in adams complaint,to wit,classifying hospital employees principally stationed in other units as psychiatric unit employees to charge additional hospital expenses paragraph scheming to admit patients not qualifying for medicare or medicaid and fraudulently billing services to medicare or medicaid,and scheming to prolong patient stays until such eligibility expired or was close to expiring paragraph and recycling patients through the psychiatric unit in violation of medicare and medicaid regulations paragraph.
nevertheless,we have held that based upon means supported by,which includes any action based even partly upon public disclosures.mckenzie,at emphasis added.we made it clear that under our interpretation of based upon,a person who bases any part of a fca claim on publicly disclosed information is effectively precluded from asserting that claim in a qui tam suit.id.thus,although relator amended complaint contains more detailed allegations about the fraudulent billing practices in white county hospital psychiatric unit,adams complaint already effectively alerted the public to the fraud occurring therein.consequently,paragraphs of the amended complaint were based upon adams complaint because three of the paragraphs in the amended complaint directly parallel adams allegations.
finally,it appears that relator is not an original source of the information contained in paragraphs of his amended complaint.original source means that the relator possesses direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the publicly disclosed allegations are based,e b,and voluntarily provided that information to the government before filing the qui tam action and prior to any public disclosure.mckenzie,at.
in the instant case,relator original complaint made no mention of fraud in white county hospital psychiatric unit,or of robert adams.relator did not raise allegations of fraud in white county hospital psychiatric unit until after adams filed his state court lawsuit.furthermore,the record does not reflect any evidence indicating that relator informed the government about allegations of fraud in the psychiatric unit prior to the public disclosure,the filing of adams complaint.the disclosure accompanying relator original complaint makes no mention of the psychiatric unit whatsoever,and relator points to nothing else on the record to support his case.therefore,we find that relator was not the original source of the fraud in white county hospital psychiatric unit.relator allegations having failed all three parts of the inquiry,no subject matter jurisdiction lies for paragraphs of relator amended complaint 
finally,we consider the district court denial of relator motion to recognize the may,settlement agreement executed between the government and chs.because the district court decision to deny relator motion to recognize the settlement was based upon its construction of statutory law,our review is de novo.see heggen lee,cir we engage in a de novo review because the pertinent issue to be reviewed is a question of law.
the district court denied relator motion,reasoning that relator was not entitled to any of the proceeds of the settlement because the government had not intervened in relator qui tam action it instead pursued separate settlement negotiations with chs,in which relator did not take part.relator contends that c entitles him to a share because the settlement agreement between the government and chs constituted an alternate remedy with respect to the claims in his case.we agree with relator.
as discussed earlier,c provides that if the government elects not to intervene in a relator qui tam action,the relator shall have the right to conduct the action.c.section c adds,
notwithstanding subsection b,the government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the government,including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty.if any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding,the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the action had continued under this section.
c emphasis added.relator argues that this means that he is entitled to a share of the settlement proceeds,even though the government did not intervene in his qui tam suit,because it pursued an alternate remedy,settlement negotiations.the government contends that congress intended the alternate remedy provision to apply only when the government has intervened in the action.the answer turns on the proper definition of alternate remedy,either as an alternative to judicial enforcement of the fca once the government has intervened in a qui tam suit,or an alternative to intervening in the qui tam suit entirely.the facts of this case present an issue of first impression for our circuit.we hold that alternate remedy refers to the government pursuit of any alternative to intervening in a relator qui tam action.
we begin our analysis with the plain language of the fca.united states firearms,cir citations omitted.in so doing,we observe that c does not expressly require the government intervention before the alternate remedy becomes applicable,nor does it define or discuss alternate remedy within the context of a government intervention in a qui tam action.rather,c states that the government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the government.c.the fca contemplates enforcement by the qui tam relator,or intervention and judicial pursuit of the fca claims by the government.the most logical reading of alternate remedy is as the government alternative to judicial pursuit of the relator claims,an alternative to intervening in a qui tam action.the government interpretation of c as applying only when the government has intervened,on the other hand,is less logical.section c seeks to insure a relator right to a share of any proceeds obtained through an alternate remedy yet d already guarantees a relator a percentage of the proceeds if the government intervenes in the action.thus,limiting alternate remedy to situations where the government has intervened would render c at least partially superfluous,a result we generally avoid in constru
