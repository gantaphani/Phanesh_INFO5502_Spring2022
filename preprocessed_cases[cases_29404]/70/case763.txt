a personal injury plaintiff,himself an attorney,was sanctioned for prosecuting a frivolous appeal.he immediately filed a malpractice action against the attorney who had represented him in the appeal,contending an attorney who prosecutes a frivolous appeal thereby commits malpractice per se.the trial court agreed,and entered summary judgment against the appellate practitioner.
the appellate practitioner appeals.he argues the trial court erred in applying res judicata and collateral estoppel principles so as to preclude him from asserting that the appeal was not frivolous and that he did not commit malpractice.we agree with the appellate practitioner,and reverse and remand.when a client is sanctioned for the filing of a frivolous appeal,it does not mean that his or her attorney has committed malpractice as a matter of law and has no right to a trial on the merits.
factsa.snow summit litigation 
attorney jeffrey dawson dawson was injured while skiing when he fell and slid into a wooden fence.dawson filed a personal injury action against snow summit,the operator of the ski area dawson snow summit,super.san bernardino county,no.snow summit,moved for summary judgment,citing the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk,as set forth in knight jewett cal th,d.summary judgment was entered in favor of snow summit.
dawson,at that point acting in propria persona,filed a notice of appeal in dawson snow summit,november,snow summit.toledano wald and attorney james toledano collectively,toledano thereafter represented him in the snow summit appeal.
the snow summit court issued an order to show cause re frivolous appeal.a hearing was held at which both dawson and toledano were present in its order and decision on order to show cause,the court expressed several reasons for awarding sanctions,including both its conclusion that any reasonable attorney would agree the appeal was totally and completely without merit and the behavior of dawson personally.it ordered dawson to pay the court,as the average cost to the taxpayers to process a civil appeal in that court,and to pay snow summit,the amount of its reasonable attorney fees incurred in responding to the appeal.by separate opinion,the court also affirmed the summary judgment against dawson.
malpractice litigation 
dawson then filed a malpractice action against toledano for having recommended the pursuit of what was ultimately determined to be a frivolous appeal dawson toledano super.orange county,malpractice action.toledano filed a for attorney fees due and owing.
subsequently,dawson filed a motion for summary judgment against toledano.on october,the court entered an order granting the motion,in which it found there was no triable issue of material fact as to toledano malpractice.it ordered final judgment to be entered in favor of dawson and against toledano.on december,the matter came on for trial on the issue of damages and on february,the court entered judgment in favor of dawson and against toledano in the amount of plus costs of suit.
on august,trial commenced on the issue of toledano and on september,the court entered judgment against toledano thereon.
dawson filed a motion to amend the judgment,which the court heard on october.that same date it granted the motion and amended the february,judgment to include attorney david wald wald as a defendant liable on the judgment.
toledano appeals from the february,judgment,the september,judgment,and the october,amended judgment.wald,specially appearing,also appeals from the amended judgment.
analysisa.summary judgment review 
on review of a summary judgment,we examine the record de novo and independently determine whether the decision is correct.citation.colarossi coty th,d.in undertaking our independent review of the evidence submitted,we apply the same process required of the trial court first,we identify the issues raised by the pleadings,since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond secondly,we determine whether the moving party showing has established facts which negate the opponent claims and justify a judgment in movant favor when a summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment,the third and final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable,material factual issue.citations.waschek department of motor vehicles th,d.
trial court pleadings 
in the motion for summary judgment,dawson argued summary judgment must be granted when there is no triable issue of material fact there could be no triable issue because toledano was collaterally estopped from arguing that the snow summit appeal was not frivolous the issue of whether the appeal was frivolous was res judicata and the prosecution of a frivolous appeal is malpractice as a matter of law.
dawson also provided the declaration of attorney anthony chavos,who had reviewed the superior court and appellate court pleadings and files in the snow summit case and concluded any reasonably experienced attorney would agree the appeal was frivolous.he also stated his opinion that toledano had acted below the standard of care in the community by prosecuting a frivolous appeal.
in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,toledano argued neither the doctrine of res judicata nor the doctrine of law of the case applied.he also argued at length that he had not committed malpractice inasmuch as the legal positions he had asserted in snow summit were consistent with the state of the law at the time.toledano also maintained that the snow summit trial court erred in granting summary judgment against dawson.in addition,toledano claimed that the appellate court in snow summit awarded sanctions based not on his own conduct,but on the behavior of dawson himself.
order and decision on order to show cause 
to understand toledano argument about dawson role in the outcome,a review of the order and decision on order to show cause in the snow summit appeal is required.in that order,the snow summit court gave several reasons for imposing sanctions.among them,it stated,plaintiff,as an attorney himself,knows full well that this is a case which never should have been filed,let alone appealed.this is true because it is without question an appeal which any reasonable attorney would agree to be totally and completely without merit.in re marriage of flaherty cal d.this conclusion was based in part on the court analysis of the primary assumption of the risk doctrine and summary judgment law.however,the court stated its conclusion was founded on two additional reasons as well,each of which was sufficient standing alone.
it explained beyond application of the primary assumption of the risk doctrine,this is one of those cases which should never have been filed plaintiff own behavior caused his injury,under established negligence principles,it was not foreseeable that a person would behave as plaintiff did so as to collide with the fence.the court underscored that the undisputed facts demonstrate conclusively that plaintiff put himself at risk by skiing too fast for existing conditions.
in addition,the court appeared to question the veracity of dawson.it stated that,given the record,dawson could not truthfully argue that he had slowed down before he caught an edge.u nless he was traveling at a reckless rate of speed when he fell,he would not have slid the distance he did on this gentle slope with enough force to cause serious injury to his knee when he collided with the fence.
finally,the court also stated that,accepting for purposes of discussion that plaintiff may have been justified in filing his action,whether the appeal is frivolous finally depends upon a careful review of what occurred in the trial court.in this regard,by electing to appeal,plaintiff himself an attorney demonstrated a palpable lack of understanding of the summary judgment procedure.the appellate court explained that dawson had failed to correctly identify the issues framed by the pleadings and that the trial court had been compelled to grant summary judgment due to dawson failure to submit any evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact.
it is readily apparent that the snow summit court determined that the appeal was frivolous because it was unmeritorious.yet it is also evident that the court resolved to sanction dawson personally for other reasons as well.in its view,dawson had caused the accident by his own reckless behavior,and as an attorney he should have known better than to file the complaint at all.moreover,the court indicated it questioned his truthfulness in the proceedings before it.given the fact the court imposed sanctions in part because of the conduct of the client,not the conduct of the appellate attorney,it would be a sorry result to hold that the appellate attorney had committed malpractice as a matter of law based on the sanctions award.
res judicata and collateral estoppel 
general principles of res judicata 
however,dawson seeks to reorient our attention away from the various reasons underlying the sanctions award,and towards the snow summit court conclusion,as stated in the order and decision on order to show cause,that the appeal was frivolous because any reasonable attorney would agree it was totally and completely without merit.he argues that toledano is bound by that adjudication under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.
in his motion for summary judgment against toledano,dawson cited only two cases addressing res judicata and collateral estoppel principles,rynsburger dairymen fertilizer,d.and safeco insurance tholen d.neither of those cases pertains to a factual situation remotely similar to the one before us.nonetheless,the cases contain standard statements of the applicable principles of law.
as stated in rynsburger dairymen fertilizer,supra,d at pages.under the doctrine of res judicata,an existing final judgment on the merits of a cause rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction is,in all subsequent actions,conclusive of the rights of the parties,and their privies,on all material issues that were or might have been determined.citations.the application of the doctrine in a given case depends on affirmative answers to these questions was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical with the one presented in the action in question was there a final judgment on the merits was the party against whom the plea of res judicata is asserted a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication citation.id.at.in the case before us,these questions are not all answered in the affirmative.
identity of issues 
assuming that the sanctions order in snow summit could properly be construed as a final judgment,it nonetheless could not be construed as the adjudication of an issue identical to the one in the case before us.at issue in snow summit was whether dawson should be sanctioned for maintaining a frivolous appeal.as already shown,some of the considerations that went into the resolution of the issue had to do with the conduct of dawson personally,not his attorney.at issue in the action against toledano,on the other hand,was whether he had committed malpractice in representing dawson.that issue is directed at the conduct of toledano to the exclusion of dawson.to the extent the snow summit order was based on the conduct of dawson,it can not be used to determine the propriety of toledano actions.
furthermore,the legal analysis to be applied in deciding whether to levy sanctions for the prosecution of a frivolous appeal is not identical to the one used to determine whether an attorney has committed malpractice.in addressing the distinction,we first examine the policies relevant to the imposition of sanctions in connection with a frivolous appeal.
a frivolous appeal determination 
the supreme court,in the seminal case of in re marriage of flaherty cal d,flaherty,underscored the difficulty of finding a uniform definition of a frivolous appeal in california case law.as the court observed,one commentator,calling the definitional problems vexing,described judicial attempts to distinguish a frivolous appeal from a merely meritless appeal as diverse and,on occasion,entertaining.citations.witkin notes that,no useful method of classifying frivolous appeals suggests itself citation.id.at.
ultimately,the supreme court in flaherty,supra,cal d at pages,provided guidance by stating that two standards apply,a subjective one and an objective one.the former looks to the motives of the attorney and the client and the latter looks at the merits of the appeal from a reasonable attorney perspective.ibid.it stated,thus,an appeal should be held to be frivolous only when it is prosecuted for an improper harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse when it indisputably has no any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.citation.id.at.
dawson ignores the portions of the order and decision on order to show cause that were related to the subjective standard,and focuses only on the portion directed to the objective standard,whether any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal was totally and completely meritless.he concludes that because the snow summit court answered that question in the affirmative,toledano committed malpractice per se.he cites no authority for this proposition,explaining simply that it is axiomatic that it constitutes malpractice to prosecute a frivolous appeal.we decline to adopt the proffered axiom.it ignores the legal requirements for imposition of a malpractice award.
b malpractice determination 
the elements of a legal malpractice action are the duty of the attorney to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the attorney negligence.citations.budd nixen cal d,see also crookall davis,punelli,keathley willard th,d sukoff lemkin d.the plaintiff has the burden of proving each of these elements.sukoff lemkin,supra,d at.we shall now consider the application of the plaintiff burden in a malpractice action of the type before us.
in a case such as this,we start with the fact that a court in another proceeding has adjudicated an appeal to be frivolous,that being a question of law.de anza santa cruz mobile estates homeowners de anza santa cruz mobile estates th,d.whether the appellate practitioner who handled that appeal has breached a duty and whether any breach proximately caused harm are ordinarily questions of fact for the jury.crookall davis,punelli,keathley willard,supra,th at,d lysick walcom d.thus,at the outset,we observe that were we to accept the notion that once an appeal has been adjudged frivolous by a court,the attorney is deemed to have committed malpractice,we would be usurping the province of the jury to decide whether,as a factual matter,a breach has occurred and the breach has proximately caused harm to the client.ishmael millington d.of course,breach of duty and proximate cause may on occasion be resolved as matters of law,if there can be no reasonable doubt as to whether the attorney conduct fell below the standard of care or if reasonable minds could not differ as to whether there was causation.lysick walcom,supra,d at.yet those instances are very rare id.at,and this is not one of those instances.
in addressing breach of duty,the crucial inquiry is whether the attorney advice was so legally deficient when it was given that he or she may be found to have failed to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as lawyers of ordinary skill and capacity commonly possess and exercise in the performance of the tasks which they undertake.citation.smith lewis cal d,disapproved on another ground in in re marriage of brown cal d,fn,crookall davis,punelli,keathley willard,supra,th at,d.it is unclear on the record before us whether toledano advice was indeed that deficient.he claims to have asserted that dawson had a viable appeal under the principles established in knight jewett,supra,cal th,d,arguing that snow summit,had a duty not to increase the inherent risks of skiing by putting up a hard wooden fence as a barrier where any skier who fell could hit it.we can not say in the abstract that such an argument is inherently unm
