opinion of the court 
william oscar harris appeals from the district court denial of his motion to vacate an order of civil contempt that has been in effect for over five years.the order of contempt has its roots in an underlying criminal proceeding in which harris was convicted of conspiracy and fraud and sentenced to months imprisonment.the clock on that,however,has yet to begin ticking for the past five years,harris has been incarcerated on the order of contempt that resulted from his refusal to comply with an order entered in the underlying proceeding.because the court structured the order of contempt so that it tolled the commencement of harris criminal sentence,only if and when the contempt is lifted will he begin serving that sentence.we will affirm.
harris considers himself a member of the empire,a group that believes the uniform commercial code can be deployed to gain access to secret straw man bank accounts held by the united states department of the treasury indeed,harris considers himself to be a moorish sovereign being.these claimed beliefs,and actions taken in reliance upon them by harris and his cohorts,have come at a price on may,he and various of those cohorts were indicted on a panoply of conspiracy and fraud counts arising from the production and distribution of fraudulent financial documents.
the events which ultimately led to this appeal began following the indictment.harris and his sent out bogus financial documents that purported to create liens and judgments against the judges and prosecutors involved in the underlying prosecution.in response,the government moved for,and the district court granted,a temporary restraining order and eventually a permanent injunction that prohibited harris and his from continuing those activities.
unfortunately,the restraining order and injunction did not have the desired effect,and the harassing activities continued unabated.as a result,the district court held a hearing on april.following this hearing,the court held harris and his in contempt,and ordered that they be incarcerated until such time as they agreed,in writing,to stop sending bogus liens and judgments.granting a grace period to allow for one last opportunity to comply,the court ordered that harris contempt begin on april,the court later dropped the writing requirement,stating that it would lift the contempt if harris simply affirmatively ceased sending out new documents.app 
trial in the underlying criminal proceeding began on june.on july,harris was convicted on all counts of the indictment,and was subsequently sentenced to months imprisonment with that sentence to follow his confinement for civil contempt.he appealed,and we affirmed the judgment of sentence.
harris has continued to send out bogus documents and,accordingly,has remained incarcerated for contempt for the entirety of the past five years.in november,he filed a pro se motion that recycled his arguments about the jurisdiction of the federal courts,see supra note,a motion the district court construed as one to terminate harris sentence for civil,as we characterize it for purposes of this opinion,a motion to vacate the order of civil contempt.the court gave careful consideration to each of harris arguments,and on february,denied the motion.we can not overemphasize the fact,and fact it be,that throughout the proceedings before the district court,the court scrupulously avoided basing its finding of contempt on any conduct directed by harris against it and at all times displayed extraordinary patience.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review the court legal conclusions de novo,and will reverse only where the decision is based on an error of law or a finding of fact that is clearly erroneous.marshak treadwell,cir.
it has long been recognized that courts possess the inherent authority to hold persons in contempt.see united states hudson,cranch.to fine for for the observance of order are powers which can not be dispensed with in a court,because they are necessary to the exercise of all others.see also int l union,united mine workers of am.bagwell,d.there are two types of contempt,civil and criminal,and it is not always easy to distinguish between them as the supreme court has observed,the distinction is somewhat elusive.bagwell,at.
civil contempt orders are intended to be coercive or compensatory in nature,and do not require,inter alia,a jury trial.rather,civil contempt is imposed by the judge upon a finding that one has failed to comply with a valid court order.see united states shillitani,d the conditional nature of the entirely upon the contemnor continued holding civil contempt proceedings absent the safeguards of indictment and jury,provided that the usual due process requirements are met.internal citations and quotations omitted bagwell,at c ivil contempt sanctions,or those penalties designed to compel future compliance with a court order,are considered to be coercive and avoidable through obedience,and thus may be imposed in an ordinary civil proceeding upon notice and an opportunity to be heard.neither a jury trial nor proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required.
with civil contempt,the contemnor will be released subject to compliance with some condition.he is thus understood,in a familiar observation,to carr y the keys of his prison in his own pocket.bagwell,at internal citations and quotations omitted.at the same time,the civil contempt power is regarded as uniquely liable to abuse because such proceedings leave the offended judge solely responsible for identifying,prosecuting,adjudicating,and sanctioning the contumacious conduct.id.at internal citations and quotations omitted.
criminal contempt,on the other hand,is punitive in punishes for some past contumacious act.a person subject to criminal contempt is entitled to greater procedural protections than a person subject to civil contempt most importantly,the purported contemnor has a right to trial by jury.see,bloom illinois,d.
harris claims that his order of contempt is de facto an order of criminal contempt because it is,or has become over the passage of time,punitive in nature.he thus argues that for two reasons the order must be lifted because criminal contempt requires a trial by jury and other procedural protections that have not been afforded to him.
harris contends,first,that the district court could not continue to hold him in contempt after the termination of the underlying proceeding.he also contends that regardless of the merits of the order of contempt and his admitted ability to comply with that order,due process imposes a freestanding and discernible temporal limitation on the court contempt authority.we disagree with both contentions,and address them in order.
it is harris contention that a district court can not continue to hold a person in contempt once the underlying proceeding that gave rise to the contempt has terminated.here,it is undisputed that the underlying proceeding is final and complete harris has been convicted and sentenced,and his appeal was unsuccessful.thus,he posits,the court exceeded its authority in continuing the contempt.
the precise nature and contours of harris argument are a bit muddled.strictly speaking,he does not make a jurisdictional argument although what he argues does relate to a court power in essence,the argument goes,a court power over the parties before it necessarily terminates at the conclusion of the proceeding.in support of his position,he plucks a quote from the fifth circuit i f the civil contempt proceeding is coercive in nature,the general rule is that it is mooted when the proceeding out of which it arises is terminated.petroleos mexicanos crawford,cir.
we do not disagree with this unremarkable proposition,as most orders of civil contempt are inextricably intertwined with the underlying or thus rendered moot by that proceeding end.to take a classic scenario,a recalcitrant witness is haled before a grand jury,and refuses to testify despite being granted immunity.if such a witness persists in his refusal to testify,a court will often hold him in contempt until such time as he complies.such a contempt,it is universally acknowledged,must end when the underlying proceeding is over when the grand jury term expires,the recalcitrant witness can no longer comply with the order and purge the contempt,so coercion has become a factual impossibility.
but other contempt orders are not mooted by the termination of the underlying proceeding.indeed,the very case cited by harris,petroleos mexicanos,illustrates that orders of civil contempt can outlive the underlying proceeding the fifth circuit found that the termination of the underlying proceeding did not require that the contempt be lifted see id.at.
similarly,the termination of the underlying proceeding here has not rendered the order of contempt moot.harris can,and he surely should,stop his harassment of the prosecutors and judges involved in his case.accordingly,the purpose and concomitant coercive intent of the order of contempt remain alive and well.because the district court jurisdiction can not seriously be challenged,and because we do not take issue with the court continued exercise of that jurisdiction,the court did not abuse its discretion,under the circumstances before us,in refusing to vacate the order of contempt on this ground.
stripped to its essence,harris second contention is that due process places a temporal limitation on the amount of time for which a civil contemnor can be confined,regardless of the validity of the underlying order on the merits and the contemnor ability to comply with that order.harris asserts that a coercive civil contempt necessarily becomes punitive after the passage of some period of time,and points to the period of confinement established by congress for recalcitrant witnesses as an appropriate presumptive benchmark.see.because he has been incarcerated for more than five years,harris contends that the district court erred in denying his motion.
we reject that contention.as an initial matter,it is critical to emphasize two undisputed facts first,the underlying order,on the merits,is unquestionably valid and eminently appropriate second,as harris himself admits,he is able to comply with the order at any time there is simply no better example of a situation where a contemnor carries the keys of his prison in his own pocket.bagwell,at quoting gompers buck stove range.quoting in re nevitt,cir.
harris argues,however,that due process requires that a district court lift a contempt order if there is no substantial likelihood that the contemnor will comply with the order in support of his argument,he points to our old decision in in re grand jury investigation braun,cir hereinafter braun.in braun,a recalcitrant witness was given immunity from prosecution but refused to testify before the grand jury.after being held in contempt,the contemnor challenged his continued confinement,arguing that due process required that he be released before the expiration of the maximum period of confinement provided for in the recalcitrant witness statute.we rejected that contention,and affirmed the district court refusal to lift the contempt.
in so doing,we observed that even when the witness can still purge himself of contempt by testifying,he may no longer be held once it becomes evident that the duress will not succeed in breaking his silence.braun,at.at the same time,we noted that o bviously,the civil contempt power would be completely eviscerated were a defiant witness able to secure his release merely by boldly asserting that he will never comply with the court order.id.at.we then observed that other jurisdictions had placed on the contemnor the burden of establishing that there is no substantial likelihood that continued confinement would accomplish its coercive purpose.id.
for several reasons,we do not believe that braun requires us to disturb the district court decision.for one thing,braun is distinguishable in that it is a recalcitrant witness case the ultimate holding in braun arose squarely from the recalcitrant witness statute.see id.noting that the often perplexing due process issue in braun is ameliorated in the present case by the recalcitrant witness statute.that statute is wholly inapplicable here for one obvious reason harris is not,and was not,a recalcitrant witness.
moreover,any language in braun indicating our approval of the no substantial likelihood test has been seriously undermined in the past thirty years even were that language not dicta,which it is.in bagwell,for example,the supreme court clearly indicated that there is no temporal limitation on the amount of time that a contemnor can be confined for civil contempt when it is undisputed that the contemnor has the ability to comply with the underlying order 
the paradigmatic coercive,civil contempt sanction involves confining a contemnor indefinitely until he complies with an affirmative command such as an order to pay alimony,or to surrender property ordered to be turned over to a receiver,or to make a conveyance.

in chadwick janecka,cir,we had occasion to discuss the implications of bagwell.the petitioner in that habeas action,chadwick,had been involved in a divorce in state court,and was found to have improperly transferred marital assets to third parties for the purpose of shielding them from the divorce court jurisdiction and,ultimately,his possession.in response,the state court held petitioner in contempt,ordering him incarcerated until he turned over the assets.significant litigation concerning his confinement followed,and,after nearly seven years of confinement,his case reached us.
petitioner did not argue that he was incapable of complying with the state court order to turn over the assets,but rather that due process limited the amount of time for which the court could confine him for civil contempt the case was before us on habeas review,and we rejected petitioner claim,concluding that the state court determination was not contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.id.at.
in the course of reaching this holding,now justice alito squarely addressed bagwell and its indefinitely until he complies language 
petitioner,however,urges us not to take bagwell at face value.he contends that the phrase indefinitely until he complies in bagwell does not mean permanently and without other recourse.instead,he maintains that t he word indefinitely is apparently used in its most precise sense,to mean with no predetermined ending date.we have no quarrel with this definition,but this understanding of the term indefinitely does not explain away the critical statement in bagwell that a civil contemnor may be confined indefinitely until he complies.
the meaning of the statement in bagwell that a contemnor may be held indefinitely until he complies is perfectly clear.the phrase until he complies sets the point in time when confinement must cease.the term indefinitely describes the length of confinement up to that point,namely,a period having no exact limits,because the end point the time of compliance can not be foretold.chadwick contrary indefinitely until he complies means indefinitely until he complies or it becomes apparent that he is never going to comply is insupportable.
id.at internal citations and quotations omitted emphasis in bagwell.
we fully agree with this analysis of bagwell,and thus conclude that,under the circumstances before us,the order of contempt was not only validly issued but validly continued any incidental punitive consequences arising from the contempt can be squarely laid at harris own feet.we will not,as the district court said so well,dissolve a lawful order merely because the contemnor persists in violating it.app shillitani,at while any imprisonment,of course,has punitive and deterrent effects,it must be viewed as remedial if the court conditions release upon the contemnor willingness to testify.emphasis added.the constitution does not require such a perverse res
