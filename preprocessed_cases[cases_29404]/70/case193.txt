opinion of the court 
wyatt haskell appeals from the order of the district court enforcing its previous confirmation order confirmation order of a bankruptcy reorganization plan reorganization plan for bruno,an company that operates a chain of supermarkets in the southeastern united states.the order specifically enjoins the prosecution of certain fraudulent transfer claims asserted by haskell in alabama state court.the district court further ordered that,as a result of haskell violation of the confirmation order,he is to pay the costs associated with obtaining the enforcement order.as a holder of million in bruno subordinated notes,haskell argues that the reorganization plan and the confirmation order do not bar him from pursuing direct fraudulent transfer claims under the alabama uniform fraudulent transfer act aufta,et.
because the fraudulent transfer claims asserted by haskell in alabama state court were extinguished by the reorganization plan and confirmation order,and because haskell continued to prosecute the alabama action in violation of the confirmation order,we will affirm the district court enforcement order in all respects.
bruno operates a chain of about supermarkets in the southeastern united states.in,affiliates of kohlberg,kravis,roberts,lp kkr acquired an interest in bruno in a leveraged recapitalization,which was financed by an equity contribution of million by kkr,a revolving credit and term loan facility provided by a group of banks the banks,and the issuance by bruno of million in notes due in pursuant to an indenture.the indenture provides that the noteholders claims are fully subordinated to the payment in full of the claims of the senior lenders.the total financing of the leveraged recapitalization was approximately billion.
from november through march,haskell purchased million in principal amount of subordinated notes,at an average cost of to cents on the dollar,or to in the aggregate.
on february,facing difficulty meeting payment obligations from the recapitalization and in paying its suppliers and other creditors,bruno and its affiliates collectively debtors filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.as of that filing date,bruno owed approximately million to the banks,million to trade vendors,suppliers,and other secured creditors,and million on the subordinated notes.in february,the bankruptcy trustee appointed a official unsecured creditor committee the committee,which comprised four representatives of the banks,three representatives of the trade vendors,and two representatives of the subordinated noteholders.during the spring of,the committee and subgroups of the committee convened several times to develop the reorganization plan for the debtors.
in march,the debtors attorneys determined that legal claims arising from the leveraged recapitalization,primarily fraudulent transfer claims,were not viable against any of its participants.although the committee initially voted to preserve these causes of action in the plan,it reversed its position in may and,with the support of the trade vendor representatives and the banks,voted to support the plan releasing the claims.haskell,huff asset management,huff,a holder of million in bruno subordinated notes,and hsbc bank usa hsbc,the indenture trustee for the subordinated notes,objected to these releases and successfully moved for the appointment of an independent examiner to evaluate the claims.the examiner found,however,that the claims were not promising,were limited and speculative,and that significant defenses were available to each of the principal participants,the former shareholders,the banks,the subordinated noteholders,and kkr in the recapitalization.the examiner thus concluded that the fraudulent transfer claims were extremely difficult to justify in the face of the multiple legal and factual obstacles to any substantial fraudulent transfer or illegal distribution recovery by the debtors.accordingly,under the reorganization plan,these legal claims were extinguished and the potential targets of any prosecution of these claims were,in effect,released.
on august,haskell commenced an action in alabama state court haskell alabama action on behalf of himself and similarly situated noteholders,asserting claims under the aufta,claims,conspiracy claims,and breach of fiduciary duty claims.the defendants in the haskell alabama action consist primarily of participants in the leveraged recapitalization,including the chase manhattan bank chase,which served as administrative agent for the senior lenders to bruno in the leveraged recapitalization.in response,bruno invoked the automatic stay under of the bankruptcy code,and the prosecution of the haskell alabama action was suspended.
the final reorganization plan explicitly makes reference to the haskell alabama action,providing 
claims extinguished.

app.iv,at emphasis added.haskell,together with huff and hsbc,objected to the confirmation of the plan,specifically opposing the plan release and extinguishment provisions.however,after a hearing,the district court approved the debtors reorganization plan and issued the confirmation order on december.making specific reference to the haskell alabama action and creditors claims against nondebtor third parties,paragraphs,and of the district court confirmation order provide
