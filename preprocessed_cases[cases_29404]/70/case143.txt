three lawyers and their two firms appeal from an order imposing sanctions entered in the southern district of new york kaplan.the lawyers represented plaintiff atsi communications,atsi in a lawsuit alleging inter alia that knight capital markets,llc knight,the principal in atsi stock on the american stock exchange amex along with a collection of hedge funds and individual defendants participated in market manipulation in violation of federal securities laws.the district court dismissed the case as against all defendants,and we affirmed.cir.thereafter,the district court imposed sanctions on certain lawyers and law firms representing atsi collectively the atsi attorneys pursuant to the mandatory sanctions provision of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,c,on the ground that atsi had no factual basis for bringing suit against knight.sanctions were the full amount of knight fees and costs in defending the action,
the chief question presented on appeal is whether the rule established in in re pennie edmonds llp,cir pennie required the district court to make a finding of subjective bad faith before imposing sanctions.the atsi attorneys argue that here,as in pennie,such a finding is needed because the sanctions procedure initiated by the district court after the litigation was over afforded them no safe harbor in which to withdraw or amend the challenged pleading.we conclude that pennie subjective bad faith requirement does not exist in the context of the pslra because the statute itself puts litigants on notice that the court must and therefore will make rule findings at the conclusion of private litigations arising under the federal securities laws.such notice alleviates the concern that animates pennie that rule sanctions should not be sprung on lawyers when they no longer have the chance to withdraw or amend a challenged claim.at the same time,however,that concern should inform consideration as to whether opposing attorney fees are reasonable under c.
background 
more detailed factual background is provided in our previous opinion in this case,atsi commc ns,shaar fund,cir atsi i.
atsi describes itself as a firm which was founded in december of to capitalize on the opportunities anticipated by trends towards deregulation and privatization of telecommunications markets within mexico and other latin american countries.in,needing capital atsi issued four series of convertible preferred stock preferred stock,shares of which were convertible,with minimal restrictions,to atsi common shares in increasing amounts as the price of atsi common shares declined.because there was no limit on the number of common shares into which the preferred stock could convert,securities such as these are called floorless convertibles.atsi i,at.a holder of such preferred stock who wanted to increase ownership or acquire the company could actually benefit from a decline in atsi share price.accordingly,atsi elicited the purchasers representations that they would not sell shares short,or were not purchasing with an intent to resell.id.at.atsi issued preferred stock at various points to among others defendants the shaar fund,shaar fund and rose glen capital management,rose glen.
between july and,atsi share prices gyrated between and per share,but closed on august,at.atsi alleged that these price fluctuations were the result of manipulation by some purchasers of the preferred stock,including shaar fund and rose glen.on the basis of the trading volume and price movements around the time that the shaar fund and rose glen converted their shares of preferred stock,atsi believed that these defendants and others engaged in a scheme to cause a death spiral in atsi share price.it is alleged that the scheme worked as follows 
the defendant would short sell the victim common stock to drive down its price.he then converts his convertible securities into common stock and uses that common stock to cover his short position.the convertible securities allow a manipulator to increase his profits by allowing him to cover with discounted common shares not obtained on the open market,to rely on the convertible securities as a hedge against the risk of loss,and to dilute existing common shares,resulting in a further decline in stock price.
id.at footnote omitted.
atsi sued a host of defendants in october,alleging misrepresentations in connection with securities transactions,and market manipulation in violation of b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule.however,atsi complaint alleged no specific acts of short selling,and instead relied on circumstantial allegations past similar practice by shaar fund and rose glen,and clearinghouse records showing that in a period december,to january,over eight million shares were traded in excess of settlement,which atsi claimed could only have resulted from sham trading.atsi i,at.
in a first amended complaint filed in march,atsi added a claim of market manipulation against knight capital markets llc,trimark securities,hereinafter knight,the principal amex for atsi stock atsi failed to serve knight.judge kaplan dismissed the complaint without prejudice as against shaar fund and rose glen on the ground that its allegations of manipulation were conclusory,offer ed no particulars,and failed to meet the requirements of rule b.atsi commc ns,shaar fund,civ.lak,wl,at,
atsi then filed a second and third amended complaint.the third amended complaint sole allegations concerning knight were as follows 
trimark securities,knight securities group,knight was the principal declared market maker in atsi stock.most atsi trades including,upon information and belief,the shares that were traded in excess of settlement were traded through knight.
any manipulation which took place would have involved knight,who knew or should have known that they were prohibited from engaging in the activity complained of in paragraphs through which purported to allege manipulation by other defendants.
atsi believes that knight was a cooperating with the defendants listed herein engaging in similar trades on behalf of the defendants.
third amended complaint.
all or most of the defendants,including knight,moved to dismiss the third amended complaint.in february,the district court granted the motions with prejudice on the ground that the complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to link this market data to any of the defendants.atsi commc ns,shaar fund,d.the court ruled that the allegations against knight were even more tenuous and far too conclusory to pas s muster under rule b.id.at.
at the end,that order referenced the mandatory sanctions provision of the pslra,and invited the parties to make submissions as to sanctions.id.at.the court explained that the pslra requires a district court,at the conclusion of private actions brought under federal securities laws,to include in the record specific findings regarding compliance by each party and each attorney representing any party with each requirement of rule b.c.if a violation is found,sanctions are mandatory.id.at c.
multiple for rule sanctions.in opposition,atsi submitted affidavits from its counsel,james wes christian of christian smith jewell,llp a houston,texas firm,and its local counsel,carl koerner,of koerner,silberberg weiner,llp,detailing the steps they took prior to bringing suit,and arguing that they had no subjective bad faith.by order dated july,the district court denied the sanctions motions without prejudice to reinstatement pending the appeal of the underlying dismissal.
by opinion dated july,we affirmed the district court dismissal.atsi i,at b ecause atsi has not adequately pled that the defendants engaged in any short sales or other potentially manipulative activity,there is no circumstantial evidence of manipulative intent.as to knight,we wrote 
the complaint is plainly insufficient in alleging that knight engaged in market manipulation.it only alleges that knight was the principal market maker in atsi stock,that knight knew or should have known of the manipulation,and that atsi believes that knight was a cooperating.wholly absent are particular facts giving rise to a strong inference that knight acted with scienter in manipulating the market in atsi common stock and any allegations of specific acts by knight to manipulate the market,much less how those actions might have affected the market.
id.at footnote omitted.
after our mandate issued,atsi entered into settlements with all defendants except knight,and knight motion for sanctions was reinstated.by order dated march,the district court imposed sanctions on the ground that the atsi attorneys lacked any reasonable factual basis for bringing suit against knight 
the third amended complaint makes abundantly clear that plaintiff counsel lacked any reasonable factual basis for asserting that knight had violated the federal securities laws the only basis for the claim against knight was that knight was the principal market maker,that it therefore must have known that the other defendants were engaged in manipulation,and that it therefore must have been complicit.but that is simply ridiculous.even assuming that knight was the principal market maker,all that it must have known is that some person or persons were engaged in large sales of atsi common stock.
atsi commc ns,shaar fund,civ.lak,wl,at,emphasis added.the district court went on to reject as vague the atsi attorneys arguments that they had diligently researched the claims and had consulted with financial experts before bringing suit.id.crucially,the district court did not make a specific finding of bad faith.sanctions in the amount of,representing knight total fees and costs were imposed jointly and severally against each of the three lawyers whose names appeared on the third amended complaint,and their two law firms maryann peronti,gary jewell,and james wes christian,and the firms of christian smith jewell,llp and koerner,silberberg weiner,llp the atsi attorneys have timely appealed.
discussion 
a district court imposition of sanctions under the pslra and rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion.simon debartolo group,richard jacobs group,cir sims blot,cir a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.internal citations,alterations,and quotation marks omitted.we must bear in mind,however,that when the district court is accuser,fact finder and sentencing judge all in one,schlaifer nance estate of warhol,cir,our review is more exacting than under the ordinary standard,perez danbury,cir.
rule b provides in pertinent part that,by presenting a complaint to the court,the attorney signing or filing the complaint certifies that to the best of the person knowledge,information,and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,the factual contentions have evidentiary support or,if specifically so identified,are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.b.since the inquiry must be reasonable under the circumstances,liability for rule violations requires only a showing of objective unreasonableness on the part of the attorney or client signing the papers.ted lapidus,vann,cir emphasis omitted.
in in re pennie edmonds llp,cir,we recognized an exception to the standard of objective unreasonableness applicable when a district court initiates rule sanctions sua sponte long after the sanctioned lawyer had an opportunity to correct or withdraw the challenged submission.in such cases,a lawyer may be sanctioned only upon a finding of subjective bad faith.id.the exception is justified in order to strike a proper balance,and prevent.id.at.we focused on the procedural differences in how sanctions are imposed under rule c and c.when the sanctions process is initiated by a motion from an opposing party under rule c,the challenged lawyer has a safe harbor to withdraw or amend.when sanctions are initiated by a court sua sponte under rule c,no such safe harbor is afforded.the advisory committee note to the amendments to rule explained since show cause orders will ordinarily be issued only in situations that are akin to a contempt of court,the rule does not provide a safe harbor to a litigant for withdrawing a claim,defense,after a show cause order has been issued on the court own initiative.advisory committee note to amendments.pennie reasoned that since show cause orders should only issue in situations akin to contempt,and contempt sanctions require a finding of bad faith,schlaifer nance,at,then rule sanctions should also require a finding of subjective bad faith,at least when sanctions are imposed at the end of a litigation and the sanctioned lawyer has had no opportunity to withdraw or amend.pennie,at.we perceived a risk that,otherwise,lawyers would be inhibited from filing 
submissions that they honestly believe have plausible evidentiary support for fear that a trial judge,perhaps at the conclusion of a contentious trial,will erroneously consider their claimed belief to be objectively unreasonable.this risk is appropriately minimized,as the advisory committee contemplated,by applying a bad faith standard to submissions sanctioned without a safe harbor opportunity to reconsider.
id.at.pennie stopped short,however,of a blanket rule that the subjective bad faith standard applied whenever there was no longer a safe harbor,finding it sufficient in that case that the court sua sponte initiated sanctions proceedings long after the lawyer had an opportunity to amend or withdraw.at 
pennie drew a sharp dissent,which argued that all rule violations should be assessed under the standard of objective reasonableness,and that the majority the intent of the advisory committee and some circuits have declined to follow pennie.see young city of providence ex rel.napolitano,cir declining to follow pennie and noting that only the second circuit has read the present rule to require bad faith kaplan daimlerchrysler,cir declining to resolv e the mens rea issue that split the pennie panel 
in this case,the atsi attorneys principal argument is that,because the sanctions against them were initiated by the court at a time when the atsi attorneys no longer had an opportunity to amend or withdraw the pleading,pennie barred imposition of sanctions without a finding of subjective bad faith.
this case is distinguishable from pennie because the statutory wording of the pslra puts private securities litigants on sufficient notice that their actions will be the subject of rule findings.the statute requires district courts,at the conclusion of private actions arising under federal securities laws,to make rule findings as to each party and each attorney,c and if a rule violation is found,the statute requires courts to impose sanctions,c.such statutory notice is the functional equivalent of the forewarning given litigants by the pendency of a rule finding.the express congressional purpose of the pslra provision was to increase the frequency of rule sanctions in the securities context,and thus tilt the balance toward greater deterrence of frivolous securities claims.recognizing what it termed the need to reduce significantly the filing of meritless securities lawsuits without hindering the ability of victims of fraud to pursue legitimate claims,and commenting that the e xisting rule has not deterred abusive securities litigation,the congress included in the pslra a measure intended to put teeth in rule.simon debartolo,at quoting conf,reprinted in.by virtue of this statutory notice,consideration of sanctions in the pslra context can never be sua sponte and can never come as a surprise,because congress,not the court,has prompted and mandated a rule finding.
the pslra sanctions provision forecloses the kind of safe harbor afforded in rule c.the pslra explicitly directs courts to make rule findings upon final adjudication of the action,c,and it is that no safe harbor could apply retroactively.see pennie,at.the pslra does not in any way purport to alter the substantive standards for finding a violation of rule,but functions merely to reduce courts discretion in choosing whether to conduct the rule inquiry at all and whether and how
