cameel halim appeals various actions taken by the district court in his civil lawsuit against great gatsby auction gallery,incorporated gatsby.for the reasons herein,we affirm the rulings of the district court,but decline to review its imposition of sanctions on halim counsel at the district court on jurisdictional grounds.
background 
on october,halim,an illinois resident and antique timepiece collector,initially filed a complaint against gatsby in illinois state court,alleging that items he purchased at a gatsby auction did not match the descriptions in the auction item catalog.halim participated in the auction via telephone and did not see or inspect any of the items before bidding on them.halim sued for breach of warranty,misrepresentation,novation,and rescission.gatsby removed the case to federal court under diversity jurisdiction on november,and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on december,on the grounds that a binding arbitration clause existed in the auction agreement on march,the district court ruled that gatsby had successfully invoked the contract binding arbitration clause.pursuant to that holding,the district court stayed the case and ordered the parties to arbitration.
halim filed an arbitration demand with the american arbitration association aaa in march of.at the start of the arbitration,the arbitrator sent both parties a letter that confirmed various dates and deadlines.the letter also stated that at the conclusion of the arbitration,the arbitrator would issue an award including findings of fact and conclusions of law.
during extensive and contentious discovery,halim requested copies of invoices for all other purchases from the same gatsby auction,claiming they were relevant to prove that gatsby auction was not without reserve as he claimed it had been advertised.gatsby refused to produce these records on the basis that they were irrelevant to the claims brought by halim because the items halim bid on were not without reserve.halim requested a formal ruling on the discovery dispute from the arbitrator.having already admonished the parties for their failure to cooperate with each other discovery requests in a written order dated january,the arbitrator declined to issue a formal ruling.instead,the arbitrator directed the parties to abide by his january,order instructing the parties to immediately review discovery requests and make a good faith effort to satisfy those requests so that the evidentiary hearing could go forward as scheduled.the evidentiary hearing had already been continued,and as the arbitrator wrote in his january,order b oth sides have lost sight of the fact that this is an arbitration and meant to be a cost effective and efficient process to be completed in an expeditious manner.it is inappropriate for me to micromanage a laborious and tedious discovery process as if this were a litigated case in court.
the case proceeded to a final arbitration hearing,and on september,the arbitrator issued a ruling denying halim claims in their entirety.in his ruling,the arbitrator explained the factual circumstances giving rise to halim claims,and then proceeded to address halim claims in turn.the arbitrator made the following statements in his analysis of halim claims 
t hese disclaimer documents are valid,enforceable,and applicable in this case.
the burden was on claimant to overcome the obligations he imposed on himself by participating in the auction under the terms and conditions of this sale.
halim is bound by the conditions of his participation and has shown no legal or factual basis for recovery in this proceedings.
p roven fraud could overcome these disclaimer bars to recovery.however,there was no credible evidence of fraud,antecedent or otherwise,that would afford claimant any relief in this case.
c laimant failure to conduct any due diligence is fatal to a recovery by him on any applicable theory claimed by him in the case.
it is doubtful that the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive practice act applies to this case but,if it does,the evidence fails to show a violation of the act by respondent.
claimant assertion of a novation here is not supported by the evidence and must also fail as a basis for recovery.
a ny damages claimant has sustained resulted from claimant own failure to exercise ordinary diligence 
t he law and evidence do not afford halim any legal relief in this case.
the case then returned to the federal district court,where,on december,halim filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award.halim argued that the arbitrator failed to rule on the discovery dispute regarding gatsby invoices for other purchases from the auction and failed to issue an opinion containing findings of fact and conclusions of law.on january,gatsby filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award,and shortly thereafter,sent halim a rule letter informing him that gatsby would seek sanctions if halim did not withdraw his frivolous motion to vacate.halim declined to withdraw his motion,and on february,gatsby moved for rule sanctions.
on february,the district court denied halim motion to vacate and granted gatsby motion to confirm the arbitration award.the district court determined that halim failed to present any meritorious objection to the arbitrator award rather,halim simply disagreed with the arbitrator decision.on march,the district court granted gatsby motion for rule sanctions,and ordered halim attorney to pay.
ii.discussion 
halim appeals the district court decision to stay the proceedings pending arbitration the district court confirmation of the arbitration award and the district court imposition of rule sanctions.
stay of proceedings pending arbitration 
halim first argument on appeal is that the district court improperly treated gatsby motion to dismiss as a motion to stay.gatsby sought to dismiss halim complaint on the basis of a binding arbitration clause in the auction agreement.the district court,finding that gatsby had properly invoked the arbitration clause,stayed the case pending arbitration.
halim argument is without merit.as this court has noted on numerous occasions,the proper course of action when a party seeks to invoke an arbitration clause is to stay the proceedings rather than to dismiss outright,cont l cas.am.ins,cir citing tice am.airlines,cir.it is undisputed that one of the grounds on which gatsby sought to dismiss halim complaint was the arbitration clause.by seeking dismissal of the complaint based on a binding arbitration clause in the auction agreement,gatsby successfully invoked the arbitration clause and the court properly stayed the proceedings.
in his challenge to the district court stay of the case,halim also asserts that the district judge erred in finding that gatsby had not waived its right to arbitrate the dispute.halim contends that gatsby decisions to remove the case to federal court first and then to seek dismissal of the case on the merits constituted an implicit waiver of gatsby right to arbitrate.
factual determinations on which a district court predicates a finding of waiver are reviewed for clear error,while legal questions of whether a party conduct amounts to waiver are reviewed de novo.ernst young llp baker holdings,cir.a party may waive a contractual right to arbitrate expressly or implicitly.sharif wellness int l network,cir.courts must determine whether based on all the circumstances,the party against whom the waiver is to be enforced has acted inconsistently with the right to arbitrate.id.quoting ernst young,at.although a variety of factors may be considered,diligence or a lack thereof should weigh heavily in the court determination of whether a party implicitly waived its right to arbitrate.id.a party does not waive its right to arbitrate a dispute by filing a motion to dismiss or a motion to transfer venue.id.at.
halim relies on cabinetree of,kraftmaid cabinetry,cir,for his position that gatsby waived its right to arbitrate by removing the case to federal court and then filing a motion to dismiss,thereby asking the district court to rule on the merits of the case.in cabinetree,the plaintiffs filed suit in state court and the defendant removed the case to fede
