defendant guidant corporation appeals from an order of the circuit court of du page county holding it in contempt of court for refusing to produce certain materials demanded by plaintiff allianz insurance company.guidant was assessed a fine of per day for each day it refused to comply with the circuit court order.for the reasons that follow,we find that the circuit court correctly determined that illinois law applies in deciding whether the materials at issue are privileged and under illinois law neither the privilege nor the doctrine is available to shield the materials.however,we vacate the order of contempt.
background 
the following facts are taken from the record on appeal as well as our previous opinion in an earlier,related case.see allianz insurance guidant,d.guidant is an indiana corporation with its principal place of business in indiana.endovascular technologies,evt,is a wholly owned subsidiary of guidant.evt is organized under the laws of delaware with its principal place of business in california.guidant,through evt,developed and manufactured a medical device known as the ancure endograft system ancure device.the ancure device was used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms,a potentially condition arising from the development of a weak area in the wall of the aorta.guidant and some of its subsidiaries have been sued in various states in numerous product liability actions involving alleged defects of the ancure device the underlying claims.
allianz,a california corporation with its principal place of business in california,issued a claims made policy to guidant for the period from september,to september.the allianz policy provided that if a claim is made or suit is brought against any insured,the insured must 
i immediately send allianz copies of any demands,notices,summonses or other legal papers received in connection with the claim or suit 
ii authorize allianz to obtain records and other information 
iii cooperate with allianz in the investigation,settlement or defense of the claim or suit 
iv assist allianz,upon its request,in the enforcement of any right against any person or organization which may be liable to the insured because of injury or damage to which insurance may also apply.
guidant later renewed the policy by extending the coverage for the period from september,to september.in addition,six additional insurers,zurich specialties london limited zurich,gerling konzern allgemeine gerling,liberty mutual insurance company liberty,american international specialty lines insurance company aislic,westchester fire insurance company westchester,and lumbermens mutual casualty company lumbermens,provided guidant with excess coverage during the same time periods.
after guidant procured the aforementioned policies,it tendered the underlying claims to its insurers.by a letter dated october,allianz disclaim ed coverage for the underlying claims and advised guidant of certain further reservations of rights.then,on november,allianz filed a complaint against guidant the litigation.count i of allianz complaint alleged fraud on the basis that guidant made false representations and concealed and failed to disclose the status of the ancure product defects and claims arising therefrom in the course of guidant application for insurance coverage,knowing that such representations were false,in order to secure insurance from allianz.allianz complaint also sought rescission of the insurance policies for fraud count ii,rescission for mutual mistake count iii,and a declaration that the policies issued to guidant do not provide coverage for claims,losses,or liabilities related to the ancure device count iv.
shortly after allianz sued guidant in illinois,guidant and some of its subsidiaries filed suit in marion county,indiana,against allianz and each of the six other insurers,seeking a declaration that allianz must defend the underlying claims and that each of the insurers must indemnify guidant for such claims.the indiana court entered an order staying the indiana action pending resolution of allianz fraud claim against guidant in illinois.
meanwhile,on february,guidant filed a counterclaim against allianz,seeking declaratory relief and alleging breach of contract.among other things,guidant alleged in its counterclaim that allianz is obligated to defend guidant against the underlying claims and that guidant is entitled to reimbursement and indemnity for damages because of the underlying claims.guidant also moved to dismiss the rescission counts of allianz complaint.the trial court granted guidant motion,and allianz repleaded the rescission counts as affirmative defenses.on june,zurich,gerling,and liberty were granted leave to intervene in the litigation.the intervenors then filed their own complaint against guidant,naming aislic,westchester,and lumbermens as defendants.the defendants filed against guidant,claiming that they are entitled to a declaration that their polices do not provide coverage thereafter,the insurers were granted leave to file claims against four guidant subsidiaries.all claims filed against guidant and its subsidiaries were later consolidated into one complaint.
on february,allianz filed a motion to issue subpoenas to consultants hired by guidant to investigate alleged regulatory deficiencies with the ancure device.allianz alleged that the consultants possessed information relating to the litigation and documents that are relevant and admissible at trial or will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.allianz argued that the consultants materials were discoverable under illinois law because the supreme court has held that an insured may not withhold,on the basis of privilege,any documents that relate to the insurance claims that the insured tendered to the insurer.see waste management,international surplus lines insurance.guidant opposed allianz motion and moved the trial court to enter a protective order.guidant asserted that it was entitled to a protective order because the discovery sought by allianz is entirely irrelevant to this litigation and otherwise protected from disclosure by the doctrine the privilege.with respect to guidant latter claim,it asserted that california state of incorporation,the location of its headquarters,and where it retained the the discoverability of the documents at issue,that california courts have rejected the reasoning of waste management,and that,even if illinois law applies,waste management is factually distinguishable from the present case.
on april,the trial court determined that whether the documents requested by allianz in its february,motion were protected by a privilege was a procedural issue.as such,it applied the test set forth in sterling finance management,ubs painewebber,d,and held that illinois law applied to the issue of privilege raised in allianz motion.at the same time,the court held that this case appears to be a case of first impression under the fact scenario that is presented.the court recognized that the facts in waste management appear to be considerably different from the facts before the court in this case.notably,the files requested by allianz in its february,motion were created in relation to an investigation of alleged regulatory defects with the ancure device and not in the course of defending the underlying claims.thus,the court declined to extend the holding of waste management to the documents in the consultants files and opted to determine on a basis whether any of the documents in the consultants files were privileged.
meanwhile,on february,allianz served a set of document requests seeking production of 
all files maintained by any of your lawyers with respect to the underlying claims and future underlying claims,as you use and define those terms in your counterclaim against allianz.
any and all communications between you and any of your lawyers with respect to the underlying claims and future underlying claims.
guidant objected to producing any documents responsive to these requests,citing various reasons,including a generalized privilege or work product objection.
on july,allianz filed a motion to compel the production of the documents referenced in requests and.in its motion,allianz argued that the requested materials were relevant and at issue in the declaratory judgment action because guidant counterclaim requests insurance coverage from allianz for underlying claims made against guidant and its subsidiaries that seek damages arising from personal injury and other claims allegedly caused by the ancure device and a declaration that allianz must pay the defense costs incurred and to be incurred by guidant as a result of the underlying claims.allianz asserted that under the supreme court decision in waste management,the privilege and the doctrine do not protect the files of an insured attorney where those files relate to litigation for which the insured seeks insurance coverage.guidant filed a response to allianz motion to compel and attached a privilege log.in addition,guidant filed a partial motion to reconsider the court april,ruling on choice of law.in particular,guidant asserted that the trial court incorrectly deemed procedural the privilege issue raised in waste management and that the court applied the wrong test to conclude that illinois law governed whether the materials requested by allianz were privileged.
on september,the trial court convened a hearing on allianz motion to compel and guidant motion to reconsider.after hearing argument,the court denied guidant motion to reconsider.the court then granted allianz motion to compel production of the materials in requests and.in making the latter decision,the court acknowledged that this case goes farther than waste management in that there are claims for fraud and fraud in the inducement.nevertheless,the court found that like the insurance policy at issue in waste management,the parties contract for insurance contained a cooperation clause and therefore a special relationship exists between the parties until the court either rescinds the contract or declares that there is no duty to defend or indemnify.as a result,the court concluded that the waste management decision applies to the declaratory judgment aspect of this case.recognizing,however,that no court had extended the holding of waste management to a fraud or other tort action,the court granted the motion to compel with the limitation that anything that would otherwise be privileged except in a waste management type case can not be used in anything other than the declaratory judgment action.the court then entered an order memorializing its oral pronouncements 
on october,guidant filed a motion for certification pursuant to supreme court rule a a of the issues raised in the court september,order.at a hearing on october,the trial court denied guidant motion.at the same hearing,guidant informed the court that it did not intend to comply with the september,order.accordingly,the court held guidant in civil contempt and ordered it to pay a fine of per day for every day it does not comply with the september,order.the court stayed payment of the fine pending guidant appeal.guidant filed a notice of appeal from the trial court october,order on november.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to supreme court rule b b.
ii.analysis 
choice of law 
the principal issue on appeal is whether,under illinois rules,the law of illinois or the law of a foreign jurisdiction applies in determining whether the materials sought by allianz in requests and are protected by the privilege or the doctrine.according to guidant,the determination of whether a court should recognize a particular privilege is a question of substantive right,guided by the most significant contacts test.guidant adds that under the proper analysis,it is clear that either california or indiana law applies.as such,guidant asserts that the trial court erred in applying waste management to hold that neither the privilege nor the doctrine was available to shield the communications sought in this case.allianz counters that sterling finance and this court more recent decision in people allen,d,dictate the application of section of the restatement second of conflict of laws restatement second of conflict of laws to resolve this dispute.allianz posits that under section of the restatement second of conflict of laws,illinois law applies to determine whether the documents requested in the motion to compel are privileged.allianz further asserts that pursuant to waste management,neither the privilege nor the doctrine applies.we review de novo a circuit court determination on a issue.malatesta mitsubishi aircraft international,d.
does a conflict exist 
considerations are not implicated unless there is an actual conflict of law among the various states with an interest in a particular dispute.sterling finance,d at,malatesta,d at.an actual conflict exists if the outcome of a dispute will differ depending on which state law is applied.sterling finance,d at.in this case,the parties present three potential jurisdictions with an interest in this litigation california,indiana,and illinois.therefore,our first task is to determine if an application of the relevant law of these forums would result in different outcomes.if the law of these jurisdictions is essentially the same on the issue in dispute,there is no need to conduct a analysis.sterling finance,d at.
the sterling finance court noted that in the typical case involving a privilege,one state has a privilege that is nonexistent in the other state.sterling finance,d at.in this case,however,both the privilege and the doctrine are recognized in the three jurisdictions that the parties claim to have an interest in this litigation.see cal.bus.e cal.west privilege cal civ.west doctrine west privilege.trial rule b west doctrine b privilege and doctrine.guidant suggests,however,that there is arguably a conflict between illinois law and the law of california and indiana because the latter states interpret the privilege and the doctrine more broadly than our supreme court did in waste management.see sterling finance,d at,holding that the potential difference in the scope of the corporate privilege arguably creates a conflict see also allen,d at,noting that although both iowa and illinois recognize the privilege,the difference in the privilege scope creates a conflict.we begin with a review of waste management.
waste management 
in waste management,the insureds,the owners and operators of several hazardous waste disposal sites,purchased insurance from two insurers.the policies provided indemnity to the insureds for defense costs arising out of any environmental claims filed against the insureds.however,the duty to indemnify was subject to certain exclusions and conditions,including the insureds duty to cooperate.the duty to cooperate was memorialized in the policies as a cooperation clause,which imposed upon the insureds the duty to assist the insurers in the conduct of suits and in enforcing any right to contribution or indemnity against persons potentially liable to the insureds.waste management,at.in addition,the policies provided that the insurers were entitled to conduct any claim,in the name of the insureds,for indemnity or damages against persons and that the insureds shall give all such information and assistance as the insurers may reasonably require.waste management,at.
the insureds defended and settled two lawsuits brought by parties alleging the migration of toxic waste from the insureds waste disposal sites the environmental litigation.the insureds later sought indemnification from the insurers for settlement and defense costs.after the insurers denied coverage,both parties filed declaratory judgment actions seeking a determination of their rights and liabilities under the policies.during discovery,the insurers requested production of defense counsel files in the environmental litigation.the insureds withheld some of the requested information,asserting the privilege and the doctrine.the trial court ordered the production of the files from one of the environmental cases,but denied production of the files in the other case.the insureds refused to comply with the order,and the trial court held one of the insureds attorneys in contempt of court.the insureds and the attorney held in contempt appealed.the appellate court held that the insurers were entitled to all of the requested documents.
on appeal,the supreme court began its discussion by acknowledging illinois strong public policy favoring complete disclosure in litigation 
the purpose of the privilege is to encourage and promote full and frank consultation between a client and legal advisor by removing the fear of compelled disclosure of information.citation.however,the privilege is not without conditions,and we are mindful that it is the privilege,not the duty to disclose,that is the exception.citation.therefore,the privilege ought to be strictly confined within its narrowest possible limits.further,the privilege is limited solely to those communications which the claimant either expressly made confidential or which he could reasonably believe under the circumstances would be understood by the attorney as such.citation.finally,we note that in illinois,we adhere to a strong policy of encouraging disclosure,with an eye toward ascertaining that truth which is essential to the proper disposition of a lawsuit.citation.waste management,at.
the court later emphasized that illinois has also taken a narrow approach as to what materials are protected by the doctrine,reiterating that the overriding considerations under our discovery rule are ascertainment of the truth and expedited disposition of litigation.waste management,at.in light of these policy concerns,the supreme court held that the privilege and the doctrine were not available as between the insurers and the insureds in the litigation.waste management,at.
the supreme court offered two reasons why the privilege was not available to shield the documents requested by the insurers.first,the court concluded that the plain language of the insurance policies cooperation clause created contractual obligations requiring the insureds to disclose to the insurers any communications they had with defense counsel representing them on a claim for which the insurers had the ultimate duty to satisfy.waste management,at.notably,the court stated that the clause imposed a broad duty of cooperation and is without limitation or qualification.waste management,at.accordingly,the supreme court concluded that a fair reading of the insurance policies rendered any expectation of privilege unreasonable.waste management,at.
second,the supreme court found the privilege inapplicable in light of the common interest doctrine.waste management,at.the doctrine provides that when an attorney acts for two different parties who each have a common interest,communications by either party to the attorney are not necessarily privileged in a subsequent controversy between the two parties.waste management,at.the court noted that typically,the doctrine applies where an attorney has provided joint or simultaneous representation of the parties.waste management,at.however,the court also found the doctrine applicable where the attorney,though neither retained nor in direct communication with the insurer,acts for the mutual benefit of both the insured and the insurer.waste management,at.the waste management court concluded that in a limited sense,the insureds attorney did represent the insurers in the underlying environmental litigation since the insurers were ultimately liable if the plaintiffs in the underlying action received a favorable verdict or settlement.waste management,at.since both the insurers and the insureds had a common interest in either defeating or settling the underlying environmental litigation,the privilege was inapplicable.waste management,at.
likewise,the waste management court concluded that the case did not fit within the parameters of the doctrine.waste management,at.the court pointed out that in the typical case,the material is generated in preparation for trial against an adversary who may seek disclosure of his opponent work product.waste management,at.however,the materials requested in waste management were prepared for the mutual benefit of the insureds and the insurers against a adversary.waste management,at.in other words,because the requested materials were not prepared in anticipation of the declaratory judgment action in which the discovery was sought,the doctrine was inapplicable.waste management,at.the court rejected the insureds claim that the information requested by the insurers may be gleaned from objective facts,contained outside the contents of defense counsel files.waste management,at.the court pointed out that what the insurers seek to discover is the mental impressions and case assessment of defense counsel and that there is no source,outside the files,where this information might be obtained.waste management,at.
the court added that even if the doctrine applied,the materials would still be subject to disclosure pursuant to the at issue exception to the doctrine.waste management,at.the at issue exception permits discovery of work product where the material is either the basis of the lawsuit or the defense thereof.waste management,at.the court held that where,as in the underlying environmental litigation,an attorney represents the common interests of two or more clients whose relationship later becomes adverse,and,in a subsequent action,the work product of the attorney is at issue,the doctrine is not available to bar discovery by one of the original parties.waste management,at.
application of waste management 
we are bound to follow the decisions of our supreme court.people trimarco,d.both this case and waste management share many factual and procedural similarities.as a result,applying the rationale of the waste management decision to the facts before us leads to the conclusion that the communications requested by allianz in its motion to compel are not privileged under illinois law.
as in waste management,the insurance policy between guidant and allianz contains a cooperation clause.that clause includes a promise by guidant to c ooperate with allianz in the investigation,settlement or defense of any c laim or suit.the cooperation clause also requires guidant to a ssist allianz,upon request,in the enforcement of any right against any person or organization which may be liable to guidant.further,like the insurers and the insureds in waste management,allianz declined coverage for the ancure device claims and both allianz and guidant filed competing declaratory judgment actions.in addition,the materials requested by allianz in this case and the materials requested in waste management are similar.in waste management,the insurers requested defense counsel files.waste management,at.in this case,allianz motion to compel requests a ll files maintained by any of guidant lawyers with respect to the underlying claims and future underlying claims and a ny and all communications between guidant and any of its lawyers with respect to the underlying claims and future underlying claims.guidant refused to produce the requested communications on the basis of the privilege and the doctrine.the trial court disagreed with guidant position and held guidant in contempt of court.
applying waste management to these facts renders the privilege inapplicable to the materials sought to be discovered.first,as waste management teaches,the cooperation clause in guidant policy with allianz constitutes a contractual obligation.the language of the cooperation clause in allianz policy with guidant is not identical to the language in the cooperation clause at issue in waste management.nevertheless,a fair reading of the plain language of the cooperation clause at issue in this case indicates that the clause imposes a broad duty of cooperation that is without limitation or qualification.waste management,at.the clause requires guidant to c ooperate with allianz in the investigation,settlement or defense of any claim or suit and a ssist allianz,upon request,in the enforcement of any right against any person or organization which may be liable to guidant.in addition,waste management provides a second,independent basis to reject the application of the privilege to this case guidant counsel,though neither retained by nor in direct communication with allianz or the other insurers,acts for the mutual benefit of both guidant and its insurers in the underlying ancure device claims.waste management,at.that is,both guidant and the insurers still have a common interest in defeating the underlying ancure device claims.
further,although the doctrine provides broader protection than the privilege western states insurance,d,the doctrine does not apply to the materials requested by allianz in its motion to compel.as allianz points out,the documents it requested in its motion to compel were prepared for the ancure device matter for which the interests of allianz and guidant are aligned.in the words of our supreme court,the requested materials do not fit within the parameters of the doctrine because they were prepared for the mutual benefit of the insureds and the insurers.waste management,at.in addition,there is no evidence that the information requested by allianz may be obtained from any source outside of the requested documents.allianz seeks information regarding who at guidant knew what and when about the potential ancure device claims and the potential exposure related to the ancure device,at the time guidant submitted the two insurance applications at issue in sum,under illinois law as set forth in waste management,neither the privilege nor the doctrine is available to bar discovery of the documents requested in allianz motion to compel 
law in other jurisdictions 
our research suggests that almost every foreign jurisdiction that has considered the holding of waste management has assailed the decision as unsound and improperly reasoned.see north river insurance philadelphia reinsurance,characterizing the waste management decision as unduly broad and rejecting its reasoning remington arms liberty mutual insurance,refusing to follow waste management bituminous casualty tonka,deeming the rationale of the waste management court with respect to the privilege as fundamentally unsound and finding the court interpretation of the doctrine inconsistent with local authority that extends the doctrine to documents prepared in anticipation of all previous litigation eastern air lines,united states aviation underwriters,so d.rejecting the waste management court interpretation of the exception to the privilege on the grounds of state statutory law fiberglas allstate insurance,ohio misc d,noting that the waste management court interpretation of the exception to the privilege is outweighed by contrary authority state hydrite chemical,declining the notion that a cooperation clause supercedes the privilege or doctrine and rejecting the exception to the privilege as set forth in waste management see also in re imperial of america,noting that waste management has been criticized and rejected by most courts northwood nursing convalescent home,continental insurance,recognizing frequent criticism of the waste management decision.
one of the most vociferous critics of the waste management decision hails from jurisdiction whose law guidant asserts is arguably applicable to the instant dispute.in rockwell international superior court,th,d,the california court of appeal refused to adopt the rules set forth in waste management.at issue in rockwell was whether an insurance policy cooperation clause operated as a waiver of the insured privilege in coverage litigation between the insured and its insurers.the insurers in rockwell relied on waste management.however,the appellate court found several problems with that decision.rockwell,th at,d at.first,the california court refused to read the cooperation clause at issue as broadly as the clause interpreted by the waste management court.rockwell,th at,d at.second,the court noted that the insurers conceded that,at the time the cooperation clause was drafted,its drafter did not intend the clause to operate as a waiver of the privilege in any situation.rockwell,th at,d at.most importantly for our purposes,the rockwell court concluded that the waste management court cooperation clause and common interest doctrine analyses were inconsistent with california statutory law.rockwell,th at,d at.rockwell therefore suggests that,in california,the materials requested by allianz would not be subject to disclosure,under the privilege.
although the insurers in rockwell also argued that the documents they requested were discoverable under the doctrine,the court did not address the merits of this claim.rockwell,th at,d at.nevertheless,other cases suggest that california attorney doctrine is broader than this doctrine is in illinois.the california statute codifying the attorney doctrine states that any written documentation that reflects an attorney impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal research or theories is not discoverable under any circumstances.emphasis added.cal civ.west.the only exception to the attorney doctrine in california is waiver.mckesson hboc,superior court,th,d.waiver may occur by failing to assert the protection,by tendering certain issues,and by conduct inconsistent with claiming the protection or by voluntary disclosure or consent to disclosure of the writing to a person other than the client who has no interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the contents of the writing.mckesson,th at,d at.if the materials requested by allianz fit within the definition of work product as defined by california law,the waiver principle would not apply here.guidant has rigorously asserted its claim that the materials are privileged.moreover,there is no evidence before us indicating that the materials were privy to anyone but guidant,its attorneys,and their related personnel.see bp alaska exploration,superior court,d,discussing waiver exception.thus,in california,it is likely that the doctrine would bar the discovery of the materials requested in allianz motion to compel.
guidant asserts that although there is no published decision from indiana reviewing waste management,indiana courts recognize the sanctity of the privilege and doctrines and enforce them consistently in coverage cases.while the exact import of this statement is not apparent to us,we do acknowledge that indiana courts have construed both the privilege and the doctrine more broadly than our supreme court.for instance,one indiana court has noted that the privilege applies to all communications between the client and his attorney for the purpose of obtaining professional legal advice or aid regarding the client rights and liabilities.emphasis added.corll edward jones.it is also clear that in indiana,opinion work product is entitled to nearly absolute immunity from discovery see penn central buchanan,burr united farm bureau mutual insurance,and that the doctrine applies to documents prepared in anticipation of other litigation american buildings kokomo grain,
in sum,there is a dearth of authority supporting the waste management decision.california explicitly rejects the rationale of waste management with respect to the scope of the privilege.in addition,california places a broad construction on the doctrine.likewise,courts in indiana have construed both the privilege and the doctrine much more broadly than our supreme court has in waste management.as a result,we find that there is a true conflict between illinois law and the law of california and indiana as to whether the documents requested by allianz are protected by the privilege or the doctrine.therefore,we must engage in a analysis to determine the law applicable to allianz motion to compel.in doing so,we employ illinois rules to determine which state law applies.sterling finance,d at.
illinois choice of law 
guidant asks us to decide which state law to apply under the most significant contacts test.according to guidant,under that test,indiana or california law would decide whether the privilege doctrine apply in this case.allianz counters that in deciding which state law should determine the applicability of a particular privilege,illinois courts follow section of the restatement second of conflict of laws.
when faced with a claim of privilege in which there are factual connections to more than one state,courts in this country have employed various methods to determine which state law applies.bradford,conflict of laws and the privilege a territorial solution,pitt.discussing the different approaches courts have used.however,in addressing issues,illinois follows the restatement second of conflict of laws hereinafter restatement.morris chapman associates,kitzman,ordinarily,illinois follows the restatement second of conflict of laws in making decisions barbara sales,intel,d,appeal allowed,allen,d at,sterling finance,d at,and cases cited therein.section of the restatement restatement second of conflict of laws addresses privileged communications.this court recently invoked section of the restatement.allen,d at,involving privilege see also sterling finance,d at,involving privilege.
guidant urges that the analysis under section of the restatement is not applicable in this case.according to guidant,the trial court took a wrong turn at the crossroads of substance and procedure,determining that the test for procedural matters as set forth in sterling applied to allianz motion to compel.guidant asserts that the applicability of a particular privilege is a substantive matter governed by the test.courts applying the restatement first of conflict of laws generally determined whether a particular issue was considered substantive or procedural.restatement first of conflict of laws,pitt.at.however,the restatement has abandoned the dichotomy,at least with respect to the chapter of the restatement of which section is part.see nelson hix.in this regard,comment b of section of the restatement restatement second of conflict of laws,comment b,at states that the provisions of chapter,including section,do not attempt to classify issues as procedural or substantive.consolidation coal,d,suggesting that dichotomy is irrelevant to analysis under section of the restatement,vacated on other grounds,see also pitt.at hoffheimer,mississippi conflict of laws,pointing out that the restatement explicitly avoids employing the distinction between substance and procedure to decide cases deeks,raising the cost of lying rethinking erie for judicial estoppel,chi,noting that section of the restatement rejects a categorical substantive or procedural labeling of privilege rules.therefore,it is unnecessary for us to engage in such a discussion.
section of the restatement provides 
evidence that is not privileged under the local law of the state which has the most significant relationship with the communication will be admitted,even though it would be privileged under the local law of the forum,unless the admission of such evidence would be contrary to the strong public policy of the forum.
evidence that is privileged under the local law of the state which has the most significant relationship with the communication but which is not privileged under the local law of the forum will be admitted unless there is some special reason why the forum policy favoring admission should not be given effect.restatement second of conflict of laws.
the restatement provides that the state with the most significant relationship with the communication is usually the state where the communication took place,the state where an oral interchange between persons occurred,where a written statement was received or where an inspection was made of a person or thing.restatement second of conflict of laws,comment e.
although guidant disputes the applicability of section of the restatement,it argues that if that test is applicable,california or indiana has the most significant relationship to the issues raised by allianz motion to compel.the basis for guidant argument is the test derived from section of the restatement restatement second of conflict of laws.however,that provision applies to general contract questions.see diamond state insurance,d,illinois tool works,sierracin,d.as discussed above,section of the restatement determines which state privilege law applies to a particular dispute.guidant provides no discussion in its brief of why the materials requested by allianz in its motion to compel have the most significant relationship with california or indiana.in fact,it is unclear from the record which state has the most significant relationship with the materials requested in allianz motion to compel.
the materials include a ll files maintained by guidant lawyers with respect to the underlying claims and future underlying claims and a ny and all communications between guidant and any of its lawyers with respect to the underlying claims and future underlying claims.it is not clear from the record where the communications referenced in these requests occurred.the privilege log provided by guidant indicates that the requested materials include communications involving,inter alia,guidant law firm listed as wheeler trigg kennedy,llp,guidant local counsel,and personnel of guidant and its subsidiaries evt,guidant sales corporation gsc,advanced cardiovascular systems acs,origin medsystems origin.from the record,we glean that guidant and gsc are indiana corporations with their principal places of business in indiana evt and origin are delaware corporations with their principal places of business in california acs is a california corporation with its principal place of business in california and wheeler trigg kennedy,llp is located in colorado see www.wtklaw.com index.php.although the privilege log does not indicate who served as guidant local counsel,we will presume that guidant,as an indiana corporation,employed counsel from indiana.despite this information,we are unable to conclusively determine the state where an oral interchange between persons occurred,where a written statement was received or where an inspection was made of a person or thing.see restatement second of conflict of laws,comment e.therefore,for the purposes of our discussion,we will assume,without deciding,that either california or indiana is the state with the most significant relationship with the communications.
however,even if california or indiana has a more significant relationship with the communications than illinois,under section of the restatement restatement second of conflict of laws,the forum state will admit evidence that is not privileged under its local law but is privileged under the law of the state with the most significant relationship with the communication unless it finds that the local policy favoring admission is outweighed by countervailing considerations,some special reason.restatement second of conflict of laws,comment d sterling finance,d at.in determining whether a special reason exists to exclude evidence,the forum will consider the number and nature of the contacts that the state of the forum has with the parties and with the transaction involved the relative materiality of the evidence that is sought to be excluded the kind of privilege involved and fairness to the parties.restatement second of conflict of laws,comment d.applying these factors to the case at bar,we find no special reason sufficient to override illinois policy.
with respect to the first factor,guidant asserts that illinois has no connection whatsoever to the communications between guidant and its attorneys.at this stage of the analysis,however,the number and nature of the contacts that the forum state has with the communications are of no moment.comment d to section instructs us to look at the number and nature of the contacts that the forum state has with the parties and with the transaction involved.in allen,for instance,we did not examine the relationship between the forum and the communication in analyzing this factor.allen,d at.instead,we followed the plain language of comment d and examined the forum relationship with the parties and the situs of the accident.allen,d at.had the drafters of the restatement intended this factor to look at the relationship between the forum and the communication,they would have said so.turning,then,to the forum contacts with the parties,we note that one insurer,lumbermens,is an illinois corporation.
the restatement also instructs us to look at the number and nature of contacts the forum state has with the transaction.the insurance policies in this case were issued by insurers located around the globe.as noted in the preceding paragraph,one of these insurers is an illinois corporation.in addition,allianz points to the following contacts between illinois and the policy it issued to guidant the policy was negotiated in illinois guidant retained an illinois broker,aon risk specialists,of illinois aon risk,to procure the policy out of its illinois offices aon risk was the conduit by which guidant conveyed what allianz alleges were fraudulent insurance applications the policy was underwritten by allianz in its chicago office before being issued and renewed and guidant risk manager the person who was principally responsible for working and communicating with allianz and aon risk worked out of her home in naperville.thus,illinois has contacts with both a party and with the transaction involved.
for the most part,guidant does not challenge allianz position with respect to the contacts with illinois.however,relying on whirlpool certain underwriters at lloyd london,d,guidant does argue that the importance of an insurance broker location has been rejected.whirlpool is inapposite to this case,as its discussion regarding the broker contact with the forum involved a forum non conveniens analysis.moreover,the whirlpool court did not state that the location of an insurance broker would never be important.the court merely found that illinois connection with the controversy was thin because its only link to the litigation was the fact that an illinois insurance broker acted as a conduit for money and information between the plaintiff and another insurance broker.whirlpool,d at.in this case,illinois contacts are both more numerous and more significant than the contacts in whirlpool.accordingly,we conclude that the first factor mitigates against giving effect to the privileges of a state other than the forum.
the second factor,the relative materiality of the evidence sought to be excluded,also favors admission of the materials requested in allianz motion to compel.comment d of section of the restatement restatement second of conflict of laws,comment d suggests that the forum state will be more likely to recognize a foreign privilege and exclude evidence if the facts that would be established by this evidence would be unlikely to affect the result of the case or could be proved in some other way.in this case,allianz seeks the materials requested in the motion to compel in order to learn who at guidant knew what and when regarding the potential exposure for a defect in the ancure device.if such evidence shows that guidant knew of potential claims prior to applying for the insurance policies,it could affect the outcome of the case.absent some admission by guidant to this fact,we can conceive of no other way to prove this claim.accordingly,this factor favors allianz position.
the third factor,the kind of privilege involved,requires us to examine whether the privileges involved are well established.restatement second of conflict of laws,comment d allen,d at.the privilege is recognized in every state,either by common law or by statute.swinton,privileging a privilege should the reporter privilege enjoy the same respect as the privilege,geo.legal ethics,weigold,the privilege as an obstacle to the professional and ethical development of law students,pepp.in addition,all states recognize some form of the doctrine.fiechtl,know when to hold minimizing disclosure of corporate environmental information,envtl.however,as noted previously,the scope of these privileges adopted by our supreme court in waste management has not been widely followed in other jurisdictions.given the lack of acceptance of waste management in other jurisdictions,we find that this factor favors guidant.
with respect to the fourth factor,the fairness to the parties,the restatement advises that the forum will be more inclined to give effect to a privilege if it was probably relied upon by the parties.restatement second of conflict of laws,comment d,at.guidant claims that at the time the communications requested by allianz were made and the work product was created,it and its attorneys had an expectation that the information was protected from disclosure and that it could not have reasonably anticipated that illinois law would affect its protected status.we find no contrary evidence in the record.as such,we find that this factor favors guidant position.
in sum,our analysis reveals that two factors favor guidant position and two factors favor allianz position.under such circumstances,we can not say that there is some special reason for overriding illinois policy favoring the admission of such evidence.see allen,d at.in fact,our holding in this case promotes illinois view of the privilege and the doctrine.see sterling finance,d at,in view of the fact that illinois does recognize the privilege,in the first instance,but construes it strictly in the corporate context,we can not foresee any situation where a special reason would exist not to give effect to this clear,strongly articulated policy in favor of another state broader corporate privilege.therefore,we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting the motion to compel and in determining that our supreme court mandate in waste management bars application of the privilege and the doctrine in this case.
is waste management distinguishable 
guidant next argues that even if illinois law is applied,the trial court erred in relying on waste management,because that case is distinguishable for various reasons.we address each in turn.
common interest 
guidant asserts that,in this case,unlike waste management,there is no common interest between it and allianz requiring production of the documents requested in the motion to compel.guidant argues that when the insurers in waste management were presented with the insureds claim for coverage of the underlying litigation,the insurers did not deny coverage or otherwise demonstrate any intent to abandon its insured.in contrast,allianz in this case denied the very existence and enforceability of any contractual relationship between the parties by disclaim ing all coverage under the policies at issue and by seeking to rescind the policy on the basis of fraud.according to guidant,allianz can not simultaneously seek to avoid covering guidant on the ground that the parties have no contract and obtain discovery of the requested materials on the ground that the parties privity of contract creates a special relationship that suspends the usual rules of privilege.we find guidant attempt to distinguish waste management on this basis unavailing.
first,allianz did not deny coverage in a procedural sense.rather,it disclaim ed coverage and filed a declaratory judgment action to confirm its coverage decision.indeed,this procedure is consistent with illinois law.for instance,in insurance of illinois markogiannakis,d,the court outlined four approaches for an insurer wishing to challenge coverage under a policy.first,the insurer may seek a declaratory judgment regarding its obligations before or pending trial of the underlying action.second,the insurer may defend the insured under a reservation of rights.third,the insurer may refuse either to defend or to seek a declaratory judgment.fourth,the insurer may concurrently seek a declaratory judgment and defend under a reservation of rights.in this case,allianz invoked option number one.indeed,the supreme court endorsed allianz approach in waste management,where it remarked that a denial,when alleged in the pleadings or which precedes a promptly filed complaint for declaratory action,is not tantamount to a repudiation of the policy obligations.waste management,at.the supreme court reasoned that a contrary conclusion would negate the protections for which the declaratory judgment action is designed and ultimately penalize insurers for conduct which it has previously sanctioned as proper.waste management,at.
moreover,the distinction between disclaimer and denial notwithstanding,the waste management court did interpret the insurers conduct in that case as a denial.the court repeatedly referenced the insurers denial of coverage.waste management,at.furthermore,guidant
