in this appeal we consider a challenge to the imposition of sanctions under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.appellants are defense counsel in an action brought pursuant to the alien tort statute ats,for alleged violations of customary international law in nigeria.they seek review of an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york kimba wood,chief judge,affirming the order of a magistrate judge,that sanctioned them for making factual representations that allegedly lacked evidentiary support.appellants challenge the order of the district court on two grounds.first,they contend that a magistrate judge is not authorized to issue an order imposing rule sanctions,and the district judge should have therefore construed the magistrate judge opinion and order as a report and recommendation under b b subject to de novo review.second,they argue that the imposition of rule sanctions based on the statements identified by plaintiffs can not be sustained as a matter of law in light of the record evidence that supported those statements.
the panel is evenly divided on the first ground raised in this appeal,with one member of the panel concluding that magistrate judges have authority to impose rule sanctions,another judge concluding that they do not,and the third declining to endorse either view in light of the statute ambiguity.see post.fortunately,we need not decide whether the district judge applied the correct standard of review to the magistrate judge determination that rule sanctions were warranted in this case,because we agree with appellants second basis for challenging the order of the district court.as explained in greater detail below,the record evidence does not provide an adequate basis to impose rule sanctions on appellants.therefore,we rely solely on the second ground advanced by appellants to resolve this appeal.
background 
this appeal arises from a putative class action brought under the ats.the complaint charged three affiliated corporate entities with violations of international law for their involvement in oil exploration and development in nigeria.see kiobel royal dutch petroleum,d.plaintiffs moved for class certification pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,and the district court referred that motion to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation under b b.see kiobel royal dutch petroleum,civ,dist.lexis.on march,magistrate judge henry pitman recommended that the district court deny plaintiffs motion for class certification.id.at.
plaintiffs objected to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,and defendants filed an opposition to those objections.in that opposition,defense counsel stated,inter alia now we have learned that seven of the identified witnesses in support of plaintiffs claims are being paid for their testimony t here can be no doubt that the witnesses are giving testimony that plaintiffs counsel knows to be false and w e know that between february,and april,berger montague plaintiffs counsel wired to the benin republic for the benefit of the witnesses.on the basis of these statements,plaintiffs charged defense are the appellants in this violating rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,alleging that defense counsel statements had no evidentiary support.pursuant to rule,plaintiffs filed a motion for the imposition of sanctions against defense counsel.opposing that motion,defense counsel argued that their statements were supported by record evidence.
in an opinion and order dated september,the magistrate judge denied plaintiffs motion with respect to the first statement having found some support for it in the record,see kiobel royal dutch petroleum,civ,dist.lexis,at,but granted the motion with respect to the and statements,see id.at.with respect to the second statement,the magistrate judge imposed a sanction on each attorney who signed the opposition filing,see id.at,but he declined to impose monetary sanctions for making the third statement because a lthough defendants counsel overstated the amount of money sent to benefit the plaintiffs w itnesses,the amount of the overstatement was small approximately and did not materially change the nature of the statement,id.at.the magistrate judge also awarded plaintiffs of their attorneys fees arising from their partially successful rule motion.see id.at.
counsel for defendants appealed the magistrate judge september,order to the district court.applying a deferential clearly erroneous or contrary to law standard of review under b a,the district court affirmed the imposition of sanctions in an unpublished order dated august.see.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review an order imposing rule sanctions for abuse of discretion.see,storey cello holdings,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs when a district court base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or render s a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.sims blot,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.here,the district court decision to impose sanctions based on the statements challenged by plaintiffs has no support in law or therefore constitutes an abuse of discretion.a statement of fact can give rise to the imposition of sanctions only when the particular allegation is utterly lacking in support.storey,at internal quotation marks omitted.as described in greater detail below,neither of the statements that the magistrate judge and the district judge held sanctionable meets this standard as a matter of law,and they therefore can not give rise to the imposition of sanctions pursuant to rule.
t here can be no doubt that the witnesses are giving testimony that counsel knows to be false.
the magistrate judge held that there was no support whatsoever for defense counsel allegation that the benin witnesses gave testimony that plaintiffs counsel knew to be false.see kiobel,dist.lexis,at.in defense of this statement,defense counsel argue that based on circumstantial the size of the payments to the witnesses and the rush to depose them just before the end of was reasonable to infer that plaintiffs counsel knew that testimony so elicited was likely to be false.more concretely,defense counsel point to moments during depositions when they directly told plaintiffs counsel that certain witnesses were testifying falsely.for instance,one witness,ejiogu,testified that he had not returned to nigeria since he fled in september,but another witness,testified that ejiogu subsequently returned to nigeria to meet with plaintiffs counsel.id.at.the benin witnesses also denied knowing one another even though plaintiffs counsel was housing them together in a compound in benin.id.at.while there might have been even good these contradictions and inconsistencies,those contradictions were as apparent to plaintiffs counsel as they were to defense counsel.it was reasonable in the circumstances for defendants counsel to conclude not only that some of the testimony of the witnesses was false,but also that plaintiffs counsel were aware of the falsity.
defense counsel also point to fourteen statements of the benin witnesses that they contend were so obviously false that plaintiffs counsel must have known of their falsity.the strongest of these statements came from a witness who testified that shell had a billion contract in nigeria,notwithstanding that the shell petroleum development company of nigeria had annual expenses of only billion and nigeria annual gross domestic product during the relevant time period was only billion.kiobel,dist.lexis,at.the magistrate judge disagreed,explaining i t may well be that the witness was referring to a or contract the witness may have been confusing units of currency the witness may have been confusing billion and million or the witness may have just been wrong.id.at.the flaw in the magistrate judge analysis is that defense counsel need not prove the truth of their accusation,only that it was not utterly lacking in support.storey,at.as the magistrate judge acknowledged,see,many reasonable inferences can be drawn from testimony that shell held a contract in nigeria that was worth nearly ten times that annual gdp of that country.he failed to recognize,however,that one of those reasonable inferences is that the witness gave false testimony that plaintiffs counsel knew to be false because it was so wildly.
in light of this record evidence,it was legally erroneous for the magistrate judge to conclude that the statement there can be no doubt that the witnesses are giving testimony that counsel knows to be false,was utterly lacking in support and therefore sanctionable.
w e know that between february,and april,berger montague wired to the benin republic for the benefit of the witnesses.
we also reject the magistrate judge determination that there was a lack of evidentiary support for defense counsel allegation that plaintiffs counsel wired to the benin republic for the benefit of the witnesses.the magistrate judge determined that this figure overstated the amount sent by or approximately percent,and therefore in violation of rule.kobel,dist.lexis,at the source of this supposed error,in the magistrate judge view,was the inclusion in the figure of a wire transfer from plaintiffs counsel to the benin witnesses.that transfer included,in the view of the magistrate judge,that was allocated to a balance unrelated to the benin w itnesses.id.at.accordingly,the magistrate judge concluded that defense counsel allegation that plaintiffs counsel wired to the benin witnesses lacked evidentiary support because defense counsel had evidence showing that only had actually been sent.
the magistrate judge determination is flawed for at least two reasons.first,it is not clear that defense counsel statement is false.the record evidence does not show that the in question covered services totally unrelated to the benin witnesses.it shows that was paid against a preexisting balance,see id.at,but the source of that balance is not clear.it could very well be that the entire payment was connected with services provided to the benin witnesses.nothing in the record contradicts that inference.indeed,it is hard to condemn as unreasonable the inference that the comprising both a prior balance and future made for a single purpose the maintenance of the benin witnesses.because this inference was not utterly lacking in support,storey,at,it can not give rise to rule sanctions.
second,even if the statement was literally,defense counsel should have excluded from the that it alleged was sent to the benin an error does not violate rule.rule sanctions are a coercive mechanism,available to trial court judges,to enforce ethical standards upon attorneys appearing before them,while being careful not to rein in zealous advocacy.pannonia farms,usa cable,cir.as the court of appeals for the first circuit has held,rule neither penalizes overstatement nor authorizes an overly literal reading of each factual statement,cir breyer,see also forrest creek associates,mclean sav.loan ass n,cir rule sanctions do not extend to isolated factual errors,committed in good faith,so long as the pleading as a whole remains well grounded in fact.there is nothing in the record suggesting that defense counsel intentionally inflated the amount wired to the benin witnesses by or,as the magistrate judge concluded,that the overestimate had a material impact on the meaning of the statement,see kiobel,dist.lexis,at.accordingly,the possible overstatement of the amount allegedly sent by plaintiffs counsel to the benin witnesses insofar as any exists does not violate rule.the decision of the magistrate judge to the contrary constituted an error of law.
conclusion 
regardless of whether the district judge should have reviewed the magistrate judge decision under a de novo or more deferential standard of review,the imposition of sanctions in this case can not stand as a matter of law because the statements at issue do not violate rule.accordingly,the august,order of the district court,affirming the magistrate judge september,order imposing rule sanctions,is reversed.
on this appeal,we are asked to consider whether magistrate judges,when acting pursuant to a district court reference under b are authorized to issue orders sanctioning attorneys pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure or are authorized only to make recommendations to district judges on whether rule sanctions should be imposed.we do not answer that question in this case because,regardless of a magistrate judge authority,the rule sanctions at issue here can not stand as a matter of law.even though we are able to decide this case without resolving the threshold question presented,there remains a need for guidance on how a district court should review the determination of a magistrate judge that rule sanctions are warranted.compare rates tech.mediatrix telecom,dist.lexis,at june,applying de novo review,with lawrence wilder richman sec,d,applying clearly erroneous or contrary to law standard.judge leval has offered his views on the matter,leval op.infra,and i offer my own in this separate opinion.in light of the fact that this issue is unsettled in our circuit,there may be merit in judge leval advice to district judges,that in reviewing orders of magistrate judges imposing sanctions under rule they try to make the issue moot by declaring regardless of whether the standard of review is deferential or de novo,the district judge would impose the same sanction.leval op.infra at.i am not certain that judge leval is right when he writes that i t is only in the case where the district court would uphold the sanction if review is deferential but would withhold it if review is de novo that a higher court will need to decide the question.id.that said,judge leval and i have now provided some modest assistance to notes and comments editors of law reviews in search of an agenda,so we need not go mano a mano on the concept of dicta within dicta.
pursuant to b a,magistrate judges are authorized to resolve pretrial matter s by order subject to review by district judges for clear error.excluded from this grant of authority are dispositive motions,such as motions for injunctive relief,for judgment on the pleadings,for summary judgment,to dismiss or quash an indictment or information,to suppress evidence in a criminal case,to dismiss or to permit maintenance of a class action,to dismiss for failure to state a claim,and to involuntarily dismiss an action.b a see williams beemiller,cir concluding that the list of motions set forth in this subsection is.dispositive motions,and certain other matters,may be submitted to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation,which the district court then reviews de novo.see b b.the supreme court has construed this statutory grant of authority to mean that nondispositive pretrial matter s are governed by b a and dispositive matter s are covered by b b.gomez united states,see also.a when a pretrial matter not dispositive of a party claim or defense is referred to a magistrate judge to hear and decide,the magistrate judge must promptly conduct the required proceedings and,when appropriate,issue a written order stating the decision.emphasis added.
although this court has not determined whether an order granting rule sanctions is dispositive or nondispositive of a claim,other courts have.the sixth and seventh circuits have held that decisions on rule motions are dispositive of a claim and are therefore not properly resolved by order of a magistrate judge.in bennett general caster service of gordon,the sixth circuit reasoned that n othing in the federal magistrates act expressly vests magistrate judges with jurisdiction to enter orders imposing rule sanctions and rule a authorizes a magistrate judge to enter an order only as to a pretrial matter that is not dispositive of a claim or defense of a party,cir.observing that the magistrate judge purported order entered pursuant to appellees rule motion resulted in an award of money damages,the sixth circuit concluded that n othing remained but to execute the judgment therefore,this purported order was dispositive of the rule matter and,consequently,dispositive of a claim.id.as such,that court concluded,a rule motion can not be resolved by an order of a magistrate judge rather,a magistrate judge should issue a report and recommendation for de novo review by the district court.id.in further support of this conclusion,the sixth circuit noted that congress specifically withheld from magistrate judges jurisdiction over contempt proceedings which are closely analogous to rule sanctions.id.at.
similarly,the seventh circuit held in alpern lieb that,upon the referral of a rule motion for sanctions,a magistrate judge lacked authority to do anything other than make a recommendation,cir easterbrook,j.recognizing that an award under rule is conceptually distinct from a decision on the merits,that court found them similar insofar as an award under rule requires one party to pay money to another and the denial of a request for sanctions has an effect similar to the denial of a request for damages.id.at.it also found support for its analogy in the fact that a wards of sanctions are treated as separate claims for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.id.on that basis,the seventh circuit concluded that t he power to award sanctions,like the power to award damages,belongs in the hands of the district judge.see also retired chicago police ass city of chicago,cir the fact that an attorney was the subject of a sanctions request does not change the fact that resolution of a sanctions request is a dispositive matter capable of being referred to a magistrate judge only under b b or b,where the district judge must review the magistrate judge report and recommendations de novo.
plaintiffs rely on the ninth circuit decision in maisonvile.america,to support their position that magistrate judges can issue orders imposing rule sanctions,cir.in maisonville,a panel of the ninth circuit reasoned that rule sanctions were nondispositive,and therefore,magistrate judges did have the general authority to impose sanctions under rule.i am not persuaded by this logic,however,because subsequent events have altered the relevant legal context in which the ninth circuit panel ruled.in maisonville,the magistrate judge sanctioned the plaintiff attorney under rule for filing a frivolous motion to reconsider the magistrate judge denial of rule sanctions against defendants for discovery abuses.as the ninth circuit in maisonville noted,the motion for reconsideration at issue was a discovery motion and d iscovery motions fall within the ambit of rule.in,after the ruling in maisonville,rule was amended to exclude sanctions arising from discovery disputes.see.d this rule does not apply to disclosures and discovery requests,responses,objections and motions under rules through.in light of this change in the scope of rule,i am skeptical that the ninth circuit ruling remains sound.as i describe in greater detail below,discovery disputes are within the core statutory authority of magistrate judges,and it is not surprising that congress and the courts would grant magistrate judges broader power over the regulation of discovery.accordingly,i believe that the significance of maisonville has been diminished by subsequent changes in the relevant law,and that decision,a product of the legal context in which it was written,does not provide a sound to the position of the sixth and seventh circuits.
i am persuaded by the reasoning of the sixth and seventh circuits holding that a magistrate judge is not authorized to issue an order imposing rule sanctions i reach this conclusion because a rule motion for sanctions,though it arises in the context of an underlying action,is the functional equivalent of an independent claim.williams,at citing vogel united states office prods,cir.on this point,the supreme court has compared a motion for rule sanctions to a criminal contempt charge insofar as each is a separate and independent proceeding at law that is not part of the original action.cooter gell hartmarx,internal quotation marks omitted.relying in part on this authority,our court has previously recognized that the imposition of sanctions is an issue collateral to and independent from the underlying case and for that reason,even when a district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over an underlying action,it still possesses jurisdiction to impose sanctions arising from the underlying case.schlaifer nance estate of warhol,cir.
that a motion for rule sanctions gives rise to proceedings that are separate and distinct from the underlying action is apparent from the fact that,in the majority of cases,rule proceedings do not involve the same parties as the underlying action.it has been previously recognized that rule is primarily concerned with the conduct of lawyers.see,cooter gell,at a rule sanction requires the determination of whether the attorney has abused the judicial process,and,if so,what sanction would be appropriate.pannonia farms,usa cable,cir rule sanctions are a coercive mechanism,available to trial court judges,to enforce ethical standards upon attorneys appearing before them,while being careful not to rein in zealous advocacy.see generally.advisory committee note the rule retains the principle that attorneys and pro se litigants have an obligation to the court to refrain from conduct that frustrates the aims of rule.accordingly,rule sanctions are generally imposed on attorneys,not litigants.see generally fed civ.advisory committee notes the person signing,filing,submitting,or advocating a document has a nondelegable responsibility to the court,and in most sanctions should be sanctioned for a violation.as a result,a motion for the imposition of rule sanctions on an attorney is not a matter contested by the parties to the underlying action,but,as here,a claim pressed by a party against counsel for an opposing party.the fact that the parties to a rule motion are distinct from those in the underlying action underscores the separateness of the rule claim from those pressed in the underlying action.indeed,we have recognized this distinction in our treatment of rule orders on appeal.under our precedents,the imposition of rule sanctions on an attorney is immediately appealable pursuant to the collateral order doctrine.see macdraw,cit group equip,cir morley,cir see also agee paramount commc n,cir holding that attorneys appealing fee awards against them must appeal in their own names.
i also agree with the sixth and seventh circuits that the resolution of a motion for rule sanctions is surely not an action for damages insofar as the desired remedy is a monetary award to the movant.as noted above,the grounds for a rule motion are independent of the merits of the underlying litigation,arising instead from the duty of candor to the court.accordingly,a rule motion can be considered the functional equivalent of an action pressing a claim for the breach of the duty set forth in the rule.when a court determines that this duty has been breached and that a monetary award is warranted,the claim has been disposed of in full.nothing remains but the entry of judgment,or its functional equivalent.
although i recognize that these all imperfect,they are,i submit,persuasive.first,as noted above,contempt proceedings are also independent and collateral proceedings for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction.see,cooter gell,at.nevertheless,magistrate judges may summarily punish acts of criminal contempt that occur in the magistrate judge presence e.in such limited circumstance,then,a magistrate judge may take actions that are dispositive of an independent claim.this,however,is a narrow statutory exception to the general principle that magistrate judges may not dispose of claims when acting by referral,and there is no basis to expand this exception,solely by judicial action,to include rule sanctions.second,the observation that rule sanctions are effectively independent claims because they usually require that one party pay damages to another party fails to account for some exceptions to that general rule,but remains helpful nevertheless.as judge leval notes,the order imposing rule sanctions may direct the offender to publish the fact that sanctions have been imposed,attend educational classes,or seek leave of the court before filing further actions.leval op.infra at.nevertheless,damages are a common remedy for violations of rule,and that fact is surely relevant to a consideration of whether rule sanctions are an independent claim.
a determination that the disposition of a rule motion must be made by a district judge is not a disparagement of the authority of magistrate judges to preside over matters properly before them.indeed,coercive authority is entrusted to magistrate judges for matters within their statutory authority.that is why magistrate judges have the power to impose sanctions for violations of discovery orders.in thomas hoar,sara lee,for example,we held that m onetary sanctions pursuant to rule for noncompliance with discovery orders usually are committed to the discretion of the magistrate judge,reviewable by the district court under the clearly erroneous or contrary to law standard,cir.i recognize that some of the reasons which persuade me that magistrate judges lack statutory authority to impose sanctions under rule might apply also to the imposition of sanctions under rule.in the context of rule,however,these reasons are not persuasive because of a magistrate judge statutory,institutional,and historical authority over discovery proceedings.indeed,it is the broad scope of a magistrate judge authority over discovery disputes that provides the source of his authority to impose sanctions for the violation of discovery orders.conducting pretrial and discovery proceedings has been a core component of a magistrate judge role in civil cases since congress created the position of magistrate judge.see federal magistrate act of,stat.codified as amended at et.when presiding over matters unrelated to discovery,however,a magistrate judge authority is often more circumscribed.in this case,for example,plaintiffs motion for class certification was referred to the magistrate judge for a report and recommendation the disposition of that motion was unquestionably beyond the authority of a magistrate judge under b a.this limited authority over motions for class certification is not comparable to the broad authority of a magistrate judge over discovery matters.accordingly,i see nothing anomalous in the recognition of a magistrate judge sanctioning authority in the context of discovery,pursuant to rules and,but not with respect to motions brought under rule where the authority of magistrate judges is far more narrow.
judge leval believes that magistrate judges limited powers to issue criminal contempt citations undermines my argument.leval op.infra at.congress conferred additional powers on magistrate judges after bennett and alpern,thus,in his view,undermining the significance of those opinions.i believe that the reasoning in these cases remains sound,even if one construes citations for criminal contempt as being dispositive of a claim.in,congress conferred limited contempt powers on magistrate judges under e.see federal courts improvement act of,stat.under this section,magistrate judges have limited power to punish acts of contempt occurring in their presence,e,but must refer the matter to the district judge if the act does not occur in the magistrate presence,e b ii because the supreme court in in cooter gell reasoned that criminal contempt charges and rule sanctions were similar,judge leval argues that we should read the statutory grant of limited criminal contempt authority as including authority to impose rule sanctions.we can not bootstrap,i submit,the minimal grant of authority to magistrate judges to punish misconduct that occurs before their eyes into a plenary power to hold litigants and attorneys in contempt or impose rule sanctions.to do so would undermine congress decision to grant magistrate judges certain powers and withhold others.furthermore,it would contravene general principles of statutory interpretation.if we apply the historic presumption in favor of continuing law absent clear congressional intent otherwise,see midlantic bank new jersey dep t of environmental protection,the normal rule of statutory construction is that if congress intends for legislation to change the interpretation of a judicially created concept,it makes that intent specific,then we can and should interpret congress decision in to grant only limited contempt powers as an implicit ratification of the earlier sixth and seventh circuits holdings that magistrate judges do not have the authority to impose rule sanctions knowing of the decisions in bennett and alpern,congress readily could have included the power to impose rule sanctions in when it amended to provide for limited contempt powers.because congress chose to confer only limited contempt powers on magistrate judges,we should assume,pursuant to the general principles of statutory construction,that congress intended to withhold the additional authority to impose rule sanctions.
judge leval correctly observes that magistrate judges have considerable coercive authority when they impose contempt citations,leval op.infra at,but this fact does not answer the question presented,especially when one considers the restrictions on this power.section e b explicitly provides that,if the contumacious conduct does not occur in the magistrate judge presence,the issue must be referred to the district judge.
finally,i find unpersuasive judge leval argument that the similarities between rule sanctions and criminal contempt citations would make subjecting them to differing levels of scrutiny illogical.leval op.infra at.if it is true that rule sanctions bear similarities to criminal contempt citations,it is likewise true that they are similar to other actions that are subject to de novo review by the district judge.examination of pleadings in response to a rule motion is,for example,functionally analogous to reviewing pleadings for conformity with rules and and rule,where applicable of the federal rules of civil procedure and analogous also to the evaluation of motions under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.each of these rules requires magistrate judges to assess the sufficiency and validity of the pleadings.under rules,and,the magistrate judge may only issue an advisory report subject to de novo review by the district judge.see b a see beemiler,at.because rule also requires that a magistrate judge assess the pleadings,one could reason that a district judge is better suited to determine the necessity or propriety of the sanctions.accordingly,it is possible to construe rule sanctions as similar to both dispositive and matters.and therein lies the flaw in judge leval argument that,because the imposition of rule sanctions can be deemed similar to another function,they must be subject to the same level of review as that other function.instead,we must assess the level of review for rule sanctions on the basis of that rule own terms and on the basis of the known statutory prescriptions of congress.
for these reasons,i would conclude that the resolution of a motion for rule sanctions is a dispositive determination that can be referred to a magistrate judge under b for a report and recommendation only,which is then reviewed de novo by the district judge.
in their briefing of this appeal,the parties dispute whether congress gave the magistrate judge the power to impose the monetary sanction with the consequence that the sanction could be overturned only on a finding of clear error or abuse of discretion or whether congress withheld that power with the consequence that the magistrate judge was empowered to do no more than recommend the sanction,subject to de novo confirmation by the district court.that question is not clearly answered by any statute or rule,and has generated considerable discussion among the members of this panel.judge cabranes has vigorously asserted that the magistrate judge was authorized by law only to recommend,and not to impose,the sanction.i was initially not persuaded by judge cabranes reasons,and on deeper digging find that i disagree with his conclusion.in the end,the question is mooted for this appeal because we overturn the sanctions on a different basis.we are all in agreement,as judge cabranes explains in his opinion for the court,that the sanction must be vacated because there was no adequate basis in counsel conduct to justify its imposition.
because we decide this appeal on a different basis,we could simply ignore the mooted question,burying our considerable research and analysis.on the other hand,some day a court may need to decide the question.especially because the question has proved more complex than superficial inspection suggests,and because many of the significant points require an understanding of the gradual evolution of the existing statute and the interpretive authorities,and the gradual growth of magistrate judge power,publication of our conflicting views may be helpful to whatever court eventually needs to decide that question.accordingly,i set forth my view of the question,and judge cabranes sets forth his,for whatever benefit the airing of our debate may confer if and when the question need be resolved 
the question we face is whether,in enacting the federal magistrate judge act,et,congress authorized magistrate judges to impose sanctions for violations of the federal rules of civil procedure.the act does not provide a direct answer.accordingly,it is necessary to search its provisions to determine what,if anything,they reveal about congress intentions.the task is complicated by the fact that congress amended the act over time,most significantly in,to implement an important congressional reappraisal of the stature and powers of magistrate judges.see federal courts improvement act of,stat,addressing magistrate judge contempt authority.
the section of the act specifying the powers of magistrate judges is.section b a broadly empowers magistrate judges to hear and determine any pretrial matter designated to them by the district court,with the exception of a specified list of matters as for the matters falling within this excepted list,the extent of the magistrate judge powers is to take evidence and submit recommendations to the district court.see b b.the matters explicitly excluded by the act from the magistrate judges power to hear and determine are motions seeking judgment on the pleadings,summary judgment,dismissal of criminal charges,authority to maintain an action on behalf of a class,dismissal for failure to state a claim,and involuntary dismissal of an action all of these being motions that would dispose of a litigant claims,as well as motions for injunctive relief and to suppress evidence in a criminal case.id.b a.section b then adds a catchall provision that magistrate judges may be assigned such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the united states.
the list of matters excluded from magistrate judges broadly stated power to hear and determine does not mention the imposition of sanctions.nor is the imposition of sanctions prohibited to magistrate judges by any other provision of law.a literal reading of the act would thus compel the conclusion that magistrate judges are empowered to impose sanctions.
courts,however,have not read the list of exclusions literally.where the exercise of an unmentioned judicial power would be so similar in character to the powers statutorily withheld from magistrate judges that it would be difficult to understand why congress would have drawn a distinction,courts have generally ruled that congress intended also to withhold the unmentioned power.see williams beemiller,cir noting that the list of exclusions in b a is.because many of the powers withheld from magistrate judges by b a involve the determination of the suit or of a claim or of a party right to maintain the claim in the action,courts have generally concluded that other rulings which would have the same effect of disposing of a party claim or of a defense were also intended by congress to be excluded from the powers of magistrate judges.courts sometimes therefore employ an imprecise shorthand,referring to the rulings over which magistrate judges are granted authority as nondispositive of a party claims,and to rulings in the class withheld as dispositive of a party claims.see gomez united states,wlilliams,at 
within this framework,courts have decided that,in addition to the powers explicitly withheld from magistrate judges by b a,the power of magistrate judges to determine does not extend to rulings that remand a case to state court,williams,at,that enter default judgment,callier gray,cir,that deny a motion to certify a district court order for interlocutory appeal,vitols citizens banking,cir,that deny enforcement of an agency subpoena.frazier,cir,and that deny a motion to proceed in forma pauperis,woods dahlberg,cir.
in gomez united states,the supreme court,departing still further from a literal reading of the statute,ruled that the selection of the jury in a criminal case,which is not listed among the functions a magistrate judge is not authorized to perform,and which is not dispositive of a party claim,is nonetheless not within a magistrate judge powers.id.at.the court approached the question by tracing the history of congress incremental increases in the powers of these officers through a series of statutory amendments while gradually upgrading their titular designation from commissioner,to magistrate,to magistrate judge.id.at.the court noted congress gradually increasing confidence in magistrate judges,and it then asked whether these indicia of congress confidence were sufficient to support the conclusion that congress intended its general grant of authority to include jury selection in a criminal case.id.at.noting that congress continued to require consent of the parties as a prerequisite to a magistrate judge authorization to try jury cases,see id.at,and that jury selection was enormously important for the conduct of a fair criminal trial,see id.at,the court concluded that should not be construed to authorize magistrate judges to select juries in criminal trials,at least absent the consent of the defendant,id.at.
according to this approach,it becomes pertinent to inspect congress amendments to the act over time to see what light they shed on changes in congress confidence in magistrate judges as reflected in increasing duties and powers entrusted to them by the act.the provisions most likely to reveal congress intentions with respect to the sanctioning power are those portions of the act that define the powers of magistrate judges to impose other disciplinary and coercive remedies for misbehavior.the most relevant provision is subsection e,e,dealing with the contempt power.prior to,e expressly withheld from magistrate judges the power to impose contempts.upon the occurrence of contumacious conduct,the statute provided that magistrate judges were to certify the facts to a district judge,who would then hear the evidence and determine whether to punish the contemnor 
in,however,in a new enactment captioned,magistrate judge contempt authority,congress repealed the old subsection e,replacing it with a new subsection e,which grants magistrate judges considerable independent authority over contempt adjudications,both criminal and civil,as follows 
a new subparagraph to e,captioned summary criminal contempt authority,gave magistrate judges the power to punish summarily by fine or imprisonment,or both,such contempt of the authority of such magistrate judge constituting misbehavior of any person in the magistrate judge presence.
a new subparagraph,captioned additional criminal contempt authority in civil consent and misdemeanor cases,gave magistrate judges the power upon notice and hearing to punish,by fine or imprisonment,or both,criminal contempt constituting disobedience or resistance to the magistrate judge lawful writ,process,or command,in all civil cases over which the magistrate judge presides with the consent of the parties under c,and misdemeanor criminal cases heard by magistrate judges with the consent of the defendant under.
a new subparagraph,captioned civil contempt authority in civil consent and misdemeanor cases,gave magistrate judges the full coercive civil contempt authority of the district court in the same categories of cases covered by subparagraph.
for all criminal contempt adjudications,a new subparagraph gave magistrate judges sentencing authority within the range specified by the code for class c misdemeanors imprisonment for up to thirty days,or a fine of up to,or both,see b,b.
finally,and highly significant for our purposes,in the statute only reference to the question of the authority of magistrate judges to impose sanctions under the federal rules,the new e expressly stated that its grant of civil contempt authority in consent cases shall not be construed to limit the authority of a magistrate judge to order sanctions under any other statute,the federal rules of civil procedure,or the federal rules of criminal procedure.while these words do not explicitly confer on magistrate judges the power to impose sanctions,they seem to express congress understanding that magistrate judges possess that power.this passage says,in effect,the fact that we expressly confer civil contempt power on magistrate judges should not be taken to imply that they lack the power to impose sanctions.

in short,in passing the amendments,congress expressed a very much enhanced trust in magistrate judges,granting them considerable punitive powers,which had previously been absolutely withheld.to be sure,the contempt power conferred on them is not the full power possessed by a district judge appointed under article iii.subparagraph of the new e imposes limits on the extent of punishment a magistrate judge may impose for contempt,and the magistrate judge contempt power extends to contempts committed outside the presence of the magistrate judge only in cases where the parties to the litigation have consented to disposition of the case by the magistrate judge.nonetheless,under the new enactment,magistrate judges were for the first time entrusted with the power to impose criminal convictions for contempt and to punish contempts by a term of power considerably more awesome than the power to impose a noncriminal sanction for violation of the federal well as the power in some circumstances to coerce compliance with a judicial order by a civil contempt order.
prior to congress amendments,there were reasonable arguments on both sides of the question.a strong argument against finding sanctioning power in the statute would have been that,notwithstanding the literal terms of the statute,congress staked out a strong stance against the exercise of similar powers by magistrate judges.congress categorically refused to allow magistrate judges to exercise contempt powers.even though a sanction is far less consequential punishment than a holding in contempt,which can involve a criminal conviction and imprisonment either punitive or coercive,the similarities between the two forms of order are great.the supreme court has,in fact,expressly noted the similarities.see cooter gell hartmarx.both sanctions and criminal contempts are judicial orders,collateral to the adjudication of the claims and defenses of the parties,which are intended to punish misconduct committed in defiance of the court authority by a person who is subject to the court ruling both can also be employed to compensate the victim of the misconduct for expense and loss suffered by reason of it.sanctions also have much in common with civil contempt orders,as the sanction can be imposed to compel compliance with judicial commands after intransigent refusal to comply.the similarities between orders of sanction and of contempt are so substantial that a sanction imposed under the federal rules of civil procedure can be viewed as a lighter,less consequential form of the same general species as a holding in contempt.the approach taken by numerous courts,reasoning by analogy,to find that certain powers were withheld by congress from magistrate judges when they had enough in common with explicitly withheld powers,might well have suggested that the version of the act implicitly denied sanctioning power.thus,the sixth circuit,when it considered the question in,concluded that magistrate judges are not empowered to impose sanctions,and gave as one of its reasons that congress specifically withheld from magistrate judges jurisdiction over contempt proceedings.bennett caster serv.of gordon,cir.
the opposing the sanctioning power was conferred by congress have relied on the literal terms of the statute.section b a granted broad powers,except as specifically excluded.the express exclusions did not mention sanctions.moreover,the most commonly imposed forms of sanctions do not dispose of any underlying claims.a sanction that does not dispose of a litigant claim or defense is arguably not so similar to the express exclusions of b a that it should be deemed excluded by implication.thus,this circuit ruled in that magistrate judges had the power to impose a sanction for discovery violations under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,so long as the particular sanction did not determine a claim.see thomas hoar,sara lee,cir 
seven circuits passed on the question whether magistrate judges were empowered to impose sanctions prior to the amendments.five of the seven,including our own,concluded that magistrate judges were authorized to impose sanctions so long as the particular form of sanction,such as a sanction of dismissal of a claim,did not effectively dispose of a party claim or defense two circuits concluded they were not so authorized 
in any event,regardless of how the act should have been construed,after congress amended the statute to expressly confer on magistrate judges a range of contempt powers,little or nothing remained of the argument that the amended statute should be construed by implication to withhold the power to impose a monetary sanction.a literal reading of the statute,with its broad authorizations,limited by explicit exclusions,communicates no suggestion of denial of the power to sanction under the federal rules.and reasoning by analogy,in the mode employed in gomez,now tends strongly to confirm the power.just as,prior to the amendments,congress express withholding of the contempt powers from magistrate judges could support a strong argument that congress intended also to withhold the power to sanction,the grant of contempt powers to magistrate judges in now powerfully supports the conclusion that congress intended to confer sanctioning power.it is an a fortiori case.the power to impose a criminal conviction and a sentence of imprisonment is very substantially more awesome than the power to impose a noncriminal sanction.if congress conferred on magistrate judges the power to impose criminal convictions for contempt,and to put contemnors in jail,why would we interpret congress silence on the issue of noncriminal sanctions as an implicit denial of that power 
nor is it correct to describe congress present stance on the question as silence.while congress did not explicitly grant or withhold the power,it did speak on the subject.and its statement that the express grant of civil contempt authority in consent cases shall not be construed to limit the authority of a magistrate judge to order sanctions communicates an understanding on the part of congress that magistrate judges do possess that authority.
finally,the question of the authority of magistrate judges to impose sanctions under the federal rules of civil procedure scarcely seems open in this circuit.as noted above,we held in hoar that imposition of a monetary is,a sanction that does not dispose of a party claim or a nondispositive matter and is therefore committed to the discretion of the magistrate judge,reviewable by the district court under the clearly erroneous or contrary to law standard.hoar,at.
it is of course true that the sanction imposed in hoar was by reason of discovery abuse and was done under rule,rather than rule,but that is a distinction without a difference.the crucial question is whether the imposition of a sanction that does not dispose of a party claim or defense such as a monetary sanction should be considered more nearly analogous to the dispositive orders congress expressly withheld from magistrate judges or to the punitive and coercive power congress expressly granted to magistrate judges in the new e.a monetary,one that does not dispose of a party claim or no more and no less similar to the dispositive rulings withheld by b a from magistrate judges whether it was imposed by reason of an abuse of a discovery obligation or an abuse of an obligation imposed by rule i do not see how we in the second circuit could justify ruling today that a monetary sanction for abuse of rule is dispositive,and therefore beyond the authority of magistrate judges,without disavowing our prior holding in hoar that magistrate judges are empowered to impose a monetary sanction.
i note that the analysis should be different for a sanction which does,in fact,dismiss a suit or prevent a claim or defense from being advanced.see hoar,at t he imposition of certain sanctions under rule,in some instances,may be considered,requiring de novo review.citing moore,lucas sinclair,moore federal practice,at ed.in such circumstances,the sanction would have the same effect as the rulings expressly excluded by b a,or would be so similar to those rulings as to be implicitly excluded.see ocelot oil,at noting that magistrate judges are generally authorized to impose rule sanctions,but ruling that a sanction striking pleadings with prejudice effectively constitutes involuntary dismissal of action and is therefore implicitly excluded by b a.analyzing the effects of the particular sanction imposed by a magistrate judge,to determine whether it is dispositive or nondispositive of a claim,is the approach that best implements congress intent.see wright miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed advocating a textured view of,which requires the court to go beyond the label and consider the impact of the action taken on the case to determine whether it is dispositive.
i conclude that,while reasonable arguments could have been advanced on both sides of the question prior to,when the governing statute was truly silent on the question of the authority of magistrate judges to impose sanctions,since congress passed the amendments,all indications very strongly support the conclusion that,with the exception of a sanction in a form that disposes of a claim or defense,empowers magistrate judges to impose sanctions.furthermore,since we decided in hoar in that monetary sanctions are not dispositive and are therefore entrusted to magistrate judges by b a,the question has been resolved for purposes of this circuit law.certainly no change in the governing legislation since our decision in hoar could support the conclusion that congress withdrew that power.
i turn to examine judge cabranes arguments to see how it can be that,upon examination of the same materials,we come to such different conclusions.judge cabranes advances numerous arguments in support of his conclusion that magistrate judges lack power to impose sanctions.in my view,each of his arguments depends on a misperception of the facts or of various rules of law.
judge cabranes begins by noting that the sixth and seventh circuits in bennett general caster service of gordon,and alpern lieb,have held that decisions on rule motions are dispositive of a claim and are therefore not properly resolved by order of a magistrate judge.ante at.he goes on to describe those decisions.in both cases,the courts concluded that an award of sanctions shares features in common with an award of monetary damages,a power withheld from magistrate judges by b a.the sixth circuit in bennett also noted that magistrate judges were expressly forbidden from exercising the contempt power.there are numerous reasons why citation to those decisions,made in and,can not properly govern our analysis of the question today.
the most important reason is that bennett and alpern were decided under the old statute,before congress amended it by granting magistrate judges significant contempt powers which it had previously withheld,and before congress stated in e that the express grant of civil contempt powers shall not be construed to limit the authority of a magistrate judge to order sanctions.at that time,the statute was opaque as to whether magistrate judges could impose sanctions.in the absence of any clear congressional guidance,the bennett and alpern courts searched for analogies to powers expressly granted or withheld.sanctions were more nearly analogous to awards of money damages which were not authorized to magistrate judges in referrals under b a than to any power magistrate judges were authorized at the time to exercise.and the bennett opinion further noted the analogy to contempt,which congress also had expressly withheld.
today,however,following the revision in,the pertinent analogies are very substantially changed.there is little reason to believe the sixth and seventh circuits would reach the same result if they considered the question anew under the amended statute.in the first place,the statute is no longer opaque,much less silent congress new observation in e powerfully suggests that congress intends magistrate judges to exercise sanctioning power.the very reasons that persuaded the sixth and seventh circuits that the imposition of a sanction should be considered dispositive apply equally to contempts,which congress has now within limits clearly placed in the nondispositive,authorized category.finally,the similarity between sanctions and contempts is far stronger,for reasons further explained below,than the similarity between sanctions and awards of money damages in resolution of a plaintiff claim.at the time of the sixth and seventh circuit decisions,the analogy to both contempts and awards of damages argued in favor of the conclusion that congress had withheld the sanction power.now the much stronger similarity to contempt argues,indeed as an a fortiori case,that congress intends magistrate judges to exercise sanctioning power 
a further problem with judge cabranes focus on the sixth and seventh circuit decisions in bennett and alpern is that his selection of those two cases is arbitrary.as noted above,seven circuits,including ours,considered whether magistrate judges were empowered under the statute to award sanctions.while judge cabranes is correct that two circuits concluded that they were not,five circuits concluded that magistrate judges did possess sanctioning power,so long as the sanction imposed was not one which disposed of a claim or defense in the underlying action 
furthermore,numerous district court decisions,which judge cabranes disregards,have similarly ruled that,while a magistrate judge may not impose a sanction that disposes of a claim or defense,a sanction such as a monetary penalty that does not do so is in the nondispositive category and is therefore within the powers conferred on a magistrate judge by b a.see,lawrence wilder richman sec,d,magee paul revere life ins,weeks stevedoring raymond int l builders,laser med.research found.aeroflot soviet airlines,civ pkl,wl,at.
judge cabranes argues that the decisions of the five circuits,including ours,that have upheld magistrate judge authority to sanction are irrelevant because they involved imposition of sanctions under rule for misbehavior relating to discovery,while this case involves a sanction imposed under rule,which relates to pleading,motions,and other papers.he contends that sanctions under rule for discovery misbehavior are completely different from sanctions under rule.
judge cabranes thus advances the surprising proposition that congress silently,without leaving a clue of those intentions,left us to guess that it intended to authorize magistrate judges to exercise sanctioning power under rule for abuses related to discovery,but not to exercise sanctioning power under rule for abuses relating to pleadings and motions.in explanation,judge cabranes writes,c oercive authority is entrusted to magistrate judges for matters within their statutory authority.that is why magistrate judges have the power to impose sanctions for violations of discovery orders t he broad scope of a magistrate judge authority over discovery disputes provides the source of his authority to impose sanctions for the violation of discovery orders.ante at.there is no support for this argument in any statute,rule,or judicial opinion.if anything,it seems to demonstrate the opposite of what judge cabranes contends.
in the first place,the hoar decision said nothing of the kind.it simply examined whether sanction orders should be considered dispositive of a party claim not a word of the discussion invoked,or even mentioned,the broad scope of a magistrate judge authority over discovery disputes.
the same is true of numerous other decisions of circuit and district courts upholding the authority of magistrate judges to award sanctions.no decision i have found justifies a magistrate judge authority to impose rule discovery sanctions on the basis of a magistrate judge broader authority or experience in discovery matters than in dealing with pleadings and motions.these decisions look to whether the sanction imposed by the magistrate judge in fact disposes of a claim or defense in which case it would be dispositive and beyond the magistrate judge authority,or whether,like a monetary sanction,it imposes a penalty or remedy that does not dispose of a claim or defense in which case it is nondispositive and falls within the powers conferred on magistrate judges by b a.see wright miller,at noting that courts have distinguish ed between discovery sanctions that are dispositive and those that are not.nor do the decisions of the bennett and alpern courts,which held that magistrate judges lacked the power to impose rule sanctions,suggest that a rule sanction is more dispositive than a discovery sanction,or that the authorization of magistrate judges to impose a sanction depends on whether it involved abuse of obligations relating to discovery or to the statements in pleadings,motions,and other papers.so far as i am aware,judge cabranes is the first and only judge to suggest that congress might have granted to magistrate judges the authority to award sanctions under rule for abuse in connection with discovery while denying them authority to impose sanctions under rule 
judge cabranes observation that coercive authority is entrusted to magistrate judges for matters within their statutory authority,ante at,is particularly puzzling.this is scarcely an argument for denying magistrate judges sanctioning power over matters under rule.if anything it demonstrates the opposite.all sorts of motions subject to rule are routinely referred by district judges to magistrate judges under the broad authority of b a.rule b specifies as to such a motion or answering paper that b y presenting it to the court an attorney certifies that the legal contentions made in it are warranted by existing law and the factual contentions made in it have evidentiary support and rule c provides for sanctions for abuse of that obligation.judge cabranes does not contend,nor can he in the face of b a,that magistrate judges are without statutory authority to handle those motions.if judge cabranes is correct that magistrate judges have sanctioning power for matters within their statutory authority,then it follows that they have sanctioning power over abuses of rule b in connection with motions entrusted to them.
perhaps judge cabranes principal argument is that the imposition of a sanction under rule is the functional equivalent of an independent claim which should therefore be considered dispositive.ante at.he points out that,in a different context,the supreme court has compared a motion for rule sanctions to a criminal contempt charge insofar as each is a separate and independent proceeding at law that is not part of the original action.id.quoting cooter gell,at.he notes further that the imposition of sanctions is an issue collateral to and independent from the underlying case,id.quoting schlaifer nance estate of warhol,cir that a court possesses jurisdiction to impose sanctions arising from the underlying action though it may be ultimately determined to lack subject matter jurisdiction over that action that an imposition of sanctions is independently appealable and that the parties to rule sanctions are often different from the parties to the underlying matter,since it is often the attorney on whom a rule sanction is imposed.ante at.
while i have no dispute as to the accuracy of those observations,i do not understand why judge cabranes believes they support his argument that magistrate judges lack authority to impose sanctions under rule.each of the observations judge cabranes makes about the separate independence of a rule sanction from the underlying action is equally true of a sanction under rule and judge cabranes does not dispute that rule sanctions are deemed nondispositive and thus within the magistrate judge authorized powers.each is also equally true of a holding in contempt and judge cabranes does not dispute that congress has authorized magistrate judges to punish contempts while judge cabranes stresses that the contempt authority delegated to magistrate judges is less complete than the contempt authority of district judges,he can not dispute that the contempt authority that congress has explicitly given to magistrate judges shares all the features of independence from the underlying action that judge cabranes points to as proof that magistrate judges lack authority to impose rule sanctions.whatever force this argument might have had prior to congress amendment of e giving magistrate judges contempt powers in a circuit where magistrate judges were deemed not to have authority to impose sanctions under rule,the argument has none after the amendment in a circuit that has ruled that magistrate judges do have authority to impose sanctions under rule.in short,if contempts and rule sanctions are nondispositive and within the magistrate judges authority,so are rule sanctions 
moreover,in asserting that a rule motion can be considered the functional equivalent of an action pressing a claim for the breach of the duty set forth in the rule,based on the fact that,as in an action for damages the desired remedy is a monetary award to the movant,ante at,judge cabranes overstates the degree of similarity between an action for damages and an imposition of sanctions.a significant part of the purpose of an imposition of sanctions is to vindicate the authority of the court and of the rules of law,and to punish for disrespect of that authority.accordingly a sanction may be imposed even though not sought by an aggrieved party.see,morley,cir affirming district court sua sponte imposition of rule sanctions.the court may impose the sanction because the court is aggrieved.furthermore,while it is undoubtedly true that a sanction order may,and frequently does,include a monetary award to compensate an aggrieved person or party for the inconvenience and expense caused by the offender breach,that is not an indispensable part of a sanctioning order.because the injury occasioning the sanction is to the court,rule c expressly provides,the sanction may include nonmonetary directives or an order to pay a penalty into court thus a sanctioning order may involve a direction to pay money to the court,see,lavigna wabc television,inc,a direction to the offender to publish the fact of the sanction,see,in re rezulin prods.liability,civ.lak,wl,at,patsy brand,realty,civ.jsm,wl,at,a direction to an attorney who demonstrates insufficient knowledge of the governing rules to attend education courses,see,lavigna,at,or a requirement that an abusive litigant seek leave of court before filing further actions,see,colida nokia,civ.kmw,wl,at.
in short,a sanction in some circumstances may have little or no resemblance to an award of money damages as the objective of a party civil claim,but it always has great resemblance to a holding in contempt.moreover,to the extent that sanctioning orders do share common features with awards of damages,this is no more true of sanctions awarded under rule than of sanctions awarded under rule,which we have ruled are within the authority of magistrate judges.accordingly,the imposition of sanctions under rule is far more nearly analogous to powers granted to magistrate contempt power and the power to sanction under rule it is to an award of damages in a suit for damages.
judge cabranes next argument is that under general principles of statutory interpretation,a presumption in favor of continuing law absent clear congressional intent otherwise requires that we interpret congress decision in to grant only limited contempt powers as an implicit ratification of the earlier sixth and seventh circuit holdings that magistrate judges do not have the authority to issue rule sanctions.ante at.i can see no reason why.as judge cabranes acknowledges,at the time congress passed the amendment,there was a circuit split on the question whether magistrate judges could impose sanctions under rule,with the sixth and seventh circuits saying no,while the ninth circuit held yes.why would congress silence on this question constitute unexplained,implicit endorsement of the holdings that said no,rather than of the holding that said yes furthermore,since congress gave no indication whatsoever that it sees a difference between the imposition of sanctions by magistrate judges under rule and rule,if we were looking to impute to congress approval of the holdings of courts,why would we not impute approval of the holdings of the five circuits which upheld the power of magistrate judges to impose sanctions,rather than the holdings of the two circuits that ruled otherwise 
finally,judge cabranes argues,as a refutation of my arguments referring to congress grant of contempt authority to magistrate judges in the amendments 
we can not bootstrap the minimal grant of authority to magistrate judges to punish misconduct that occurs before their eyes into a plenary power to hold litigants and attorneys in contempt or impose rule sanctions.to do so would undermine congress decision to grant magistrate judges certain powers and withhold others.
this brief argument contains three substantial mistaken premises.perhaps least important,as reviewed above,judge cabranes understates the extent of contempt authority that congress conferred in e.i think it undeniable that,in comparison with the prior blanket prohibition of all contempt authority,the amendments express a very significant upgrading of congress confidence in magistrate judges to exercise punitive and coercive contempt powers.judge cabranes misunderstands and misstates my argument.i have not suggested that congress grant of limited authority to magistrate judges to impose contempts was converted into plenary power to hold litigants and attorneys in contempt.it is indisputable that the contempt authority conferred is less than plenary.nonetheless,it is substantial.finally,judge cabranes asserts that acceptance of my argument would undermine congress decision to grant magistrate judges certain powers and withhold others.this argument simply assumes its conclusion.if in fact congress had prohibited magistrate judges from imposing sanctions,and i were trying somehow to defend the contrary rule,judge cabranes would be correct that my argument would undermine congress decision to grant magistrate judges certain powers and withhold others.the reason,however,that judge cabranes and i set forth our arguments is that congress has not enacted a clear provision one way or the other.my arguments do not seek to undermine congress decision.they seek to interpret congress intentions in the absence of a clear congressional mandate.
in conclusion,the developments in the law during the past two decades seem to me to have removed any reasonable doubt that a magistrate judge may impose money sanctions under rule,at least in a circuit such as ours where magistrate judges are authorized to impose sanctions for discovery abuse.had we faced this question in the,when congress withheld contempt power from magistrate judges and our court had not yet found them authorized to impose sanctions in a discovery matter,we could reasonably have resolved the question either way.reasoning from the broad authorization of,the absence of any exclusion for sanctions,and the fact that a money sanction is collateral and is not dispositive of any claim or defense in the suit,we could reasonably have concluded,as did five circuits including ours,that magistrate judges are authorized to impose money sanctions.or,reasoning from the fact that an award of a sanction is much like a contempt adjudication,which congress had withheld from magistrate judges,and which disposes completely of a discreet controversy,we could reasonably have concluded,as did two circuits,that congress intended to withhold sanctioning power from magistrate judges.however,since congress amended to expressly grant contempt powers to magistrate judges and our circuit ruled in the context of a discovery matter that magistrate judges are authorized to impose money sanctions,all that has changed.in a circuit that authorizes sanctions in the discovery context,no reasonable argument remains that magistrate judges,although expressly authorized by congress to impose contempts and found also to be authorized to impose money sanctions for discovery abuses,nonetheless lack power to award such sanctions for abuses relating to pleadings and motions.there is no meaningful difference between sanctions relating to discovery and sanctions relating to pleadings and motions.
after much discussion in a case in which the question need not be resolved,judge cabranes and i have each set forth our arguments.if and when a case arises in which a court needs to decide whether congress has given magistrate judges authority to impose sanctions,perhaps that court will find our debate helpful in answering the question.in the meantime,because the question remains undecided,district judges would be well advised to review magistrate judge orders imposing sanctions both de novo and under a deferential standard.if the district court makes clear that,regardless of whether the standard of review is deferential or de novo,it would impose the same sanction,the issue of the magistrate judge power will be moot,as it will be in the case in which the district court rejects the sanction on either standard.it is only in the case where the district court would uphold the sanction if review is deferential but would withhold it if review is de novo that a higher court will need to decide the question.it is altogether possible that the day requiring decision will never come.
the issue that splits our panel,but which is not necessary to the resolution of this case,is the authority of magistrate judges to impose sanctions under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure in cases referred to them under b.do magistrate judges have the authority to order rule sanctions themselves,or only to make a recommendation of rule sanctions to the district court 
section of title sets the metes and bounds of a magistrate judge authority.when a district court refers a matter to a magistrate judge under b,the extent of the magistrate judge authority turns generally on whether the matter is dispositive.see generally wiliams beemiller,cir.as to nondispositive matters,the magistrate judge may rule,but as to dispositive matters,the magistrate judge may do no more than recommend.id.in turn,the district court reviews a magistrate judge order on nondispositive matters under a clearly erroneous standard,but reviews its recommendation de novo.id.
section does not specifically deal with sanctions we have held in thomas hoar.sara lee,cir that magistrate judges may impose sanctions under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure for noncompliance with discovery orders.as to the related issue of a magistrate judge authority to hold persons in contempt,congress explicitly withheld such authority in the initial federal magistrates act.see,stat.in,congress amended to give magistrate judges limited contempt powers.now,magistrate judges have summary criminal contempt authority over anyone in their presence,under e as well as additional criminal contempt authority,and the full civil contempt authority of a district court,in any case referred to them on consent of the parties pursuant to c,under e.with respect to sanctions however,specific direction from congress is still absent.
against this backdrop,judge leval is of the view that magistrate judges may impose rule sanctions,the lighter,less consequential form of the same general species as a holding in contempt.concurrence of judge leval at.judge cabranes,on the other hand,is of the view that thomas hoar is limited to the rule context.judge cabranes would thus follow the sixth and seventh circuits in holding that a magistrate judge may do no more than recommend rule the principle that imposition of sanctions is dispositive of an issue that is the functional equivalent of an independent claim.concurrence of judge cabranes at.see alpern lieb,cir bennett caster serv.of gordon,cir per curiam.
this issue has divided the district courts in our circuit.compare rates tech.inc mediatrix telecom,js akt,dist.lexis,at june,applying de novo review,with mcallan von essen,d,applying a clearly erroneous standard of review because o rders concerning rule sanctions are considered nondispositive.see also colida nokia,civ.kmw hbp,wl,at,whether motions for sanctions are dispositive or is currently a contested point of law within the second circuit,aff,wl per curiam.the circuits themselves are split.compare alpern,at imposition of rule sanctions is dispositive,with maisonville america,cir imposition of rule sanctions is nondispositive.see also lancellotti fay,st cir avoiding the vexing question whether rule sanctions ordered by a magistrate judge are properly characterized as dispositive or nondispositive.the need for guidance is clear.
however,given our earlier decision in thomas hoar,and the amendments to,any attempt to settle this issue now would only create more problems.
for example,judge cabranes proposes to distinguish rule sanctions from rule sanctions on the basis of the traditionally broad scope of a magistrate judge authority over discovery disputes,which provides the source of his authority to impose sanctions for the violation of discovery orders.concurrence of judge cabranes at.but using such a broad principle to patrol the border between rule and rule sanctions can become quixotic.how does one classify misrepresentations regarding compliance or not with discovery obligations 
on the other hand,holding that magistrate judges do possess authority to impose rule sanctions would create a confusing body of law as to what orders are dispositive under b,and the related question of when a lower court order is appealable pursuant to the collateral order doctrine.for the reasons stated by judge cabranes,as well as the sixth and seventh circuits in bennett and alpern respectively,the imposition of rule sanctions is the functional equivalent of an independent for that reason,rule sanctions are immediately reviewable in this court pursuant to the collateral order doctrine.sanko galin,cir rule sanction is a reviewable collateral order,a conclusive determination completely separate from the merits and not effectively reviewable on appeal from a final judgment.if we follow judge leval proposed holding,then rule sanctions could be referred to a magistrate judge as nondispositive for purposes of b,yet any imposition of sanctions would be dispositive enough to be immediately reviewable under the collateral order doctrine.this is incoherent.
in sum,each of my colleagues would rewrite,in a different way.i respectfully suggest that this knot needs to be untied by congress or by the supreme court.
the next sentence of the opposition read there will be further discovery into the question of who caused these witnesses to give obviously false testimony.
now we have learned that seven of the identified witnesses are being paid for their testimony.
t here can be no doubt that the witnesses are giving testimony that counsel knows to be false.
w e know that between february,and april,berger montague wired to the benin republic for the benefit of the witnesses.
the magistrate judge and plaintiffs counsel read this statement as an accusation that plaintiffs counsel was instructing witnesses to testify falsely.such an interpretation is not compelled by the plain meaning of the text.
the distinction between wrong and false is not examined in the magistrate judge opinion.nevertheless,it would be remarkable if,under rule,calling an untrue statement wrong is permissible,but calling it false is sanctionable.reference to a dictionary shows that the first definition of false not corresponding to the truth or reality not true,webster third new international dictionary ed is virtually identical to one of the definitions of wrong not agreeing with or conforming to the facts erroneous incorrect,id.at.if the magistrate judge was correct that the testimony may have been wrong,then it may also have been false.
the magistrate judge determined that monetary sanctions for this perceived violation of rule were not warranted,however,because the amount of the overstatement was small approximately and did not materially change the nature of the statement.kiobel,dist.lexis,at.even though this perceived violation of rule did not result in monetary sanctions,we nevertheless review the ruling because of the injurious effect that a judicial determination of a rule violation has on an attorney professional reputation.
i do not address here the authority of a magistrate judge to award sanctions when acting pursuant to the consent of the parties under c.because magistrate judges have substantially greater authority when acting with the consent of the parties,see,e,i consider only provisions related to a magistrate judge powers when acting on referral from a district court.
sanctions for discovery abuses are now imposed pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.
judge leval argues that my focus on the decisions in bennett and alpern is arbitrary because seven circuits,including ours,considered whether magistrate judges were empowered under the statute to award sanctions.leval op.infra at.the cases to which judge leval refers,however,involve sanctions for discovery abuses under rule before it was amended in or they involve sanctions under rule.here,we consider whether magistrate judges have the authority to impose sanctions under the current rule,and i need not comment on the authority of magistrate judges to impose sanctions under rule.
although congress has conferred on magistrate judges broader authority to punish acts of contempt when presiding with the consent of the parties,e,this does not affect our discussion,which is limited to the authority of magistrate judges when acting by referral of a district judge,rather than upon consent of the parties.
i emphasize again that congress granted narrow contempt powers when the magistrate is acting by referral and broader contempt powers when the magistrate is acting with the consent of the parties.because we here consider only whether magistrate judges have authority to impose rule sanctions when acting by referral,any powers congress granted to magistrate judges when acting with the consent of the parties is,in my view,entirely irrelevant to the current inquiry.
this assumes,i believe reasonably,that the logic of maisonville,which was decided in,did not survive the amendments to rule,and thus that there was no split among the circuits as to whether magistrate judges could impose sanctions under the rule for actions not related to discovery.
i agree with judge jacobs that amendment to the federal rules of civil procedure or the governing statute could usefully dispel interpretive disagreement as to congress intention and obviate further confusion.
section b a provides a judge may designate a magistrate judge to hear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court,except a motion for injunctive relief,for judgment on the pleadings,for summary judgment,to dismiss or quash an indictment or information made by the defendant,to suppress evidence in a criminal case,to dismiss or to permit maintenance of a class action,to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,and to involuntarily dismiss an action.a judge of the court may reconsider any pretrial matter under this subparagraph a where it has been shown that the magistrate judge order is clearly erroneous or contrary to law b a.
this shorthand is reflected in rule of the federal rules of civi
