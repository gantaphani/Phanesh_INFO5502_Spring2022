the petitioners seek review of an order of the securities and exchange commission the commission or the sec sustaining the petitioners termination by the new york stock exchange the exchange or the nyse of their exchange membership.the petitioners argue that the exchange partiality required its hearing officer to recuse himself from the disciplinary proceedings that resulted in the petitioners termination the partiality of the commission similarly required the commission to recuse itself with respect to its review of the exchange order and the sanctions imposed by the exchange were impermissible because they were disproportionately harsh.
background 
the petitioners and their relevant conduct 
in,the petitioner john began his career as a floor broker at the exchange.he purchased a membership on the exchange in december.he operated as an independent floor broker until his suspension by the exchange in february.
by february,had become an exchange floor official.as such,he was responsible for answering the questions of other floor brokers about exchange rules and their interpretation.during the period relevant to this appeal,was an employee of petitioner securities,an exchange securities or firm.was owner,president,and director of his firm,and acted as the firm floor broker.on february,the exchange summarily suspended and his firm from exchange membership and from access to exchange services.those suspensions set in motion the series of events that ultimately led to the present petition.
the exchange is a organization sro subject to commission oversight pursuant to,with exceptions not relevant here,a federal statute and a commission regulation make it unlawful for an sro floor broker to trade for an account in which the broker has an interest or over which the broker exercises discretion.a section a rule these prohibitions are designed to prevent floor brokers from exploiting market information and opportunities that are available to them but unavailable to other investors.see nyse,exchange act release,docket,wl,at,sec lexis,at.the ban on proprietary or discretionary trading by floor brokers is further reflected in exchange rules.see nyse rule a,a,a.and his that during the period prior to their suspension from exchange membership,senior exchange officials were aware of violations of section a and related rules,and yet tacitly encouraged floor brokers to engage in such activity 
exchange rules also prohibit floor brokers from crossing trades and trading ahead,also called frontrunning.see nyse rule crossing trades nyse rule trading ahead,frontrunning.a broker crosses trades when he or she fills a customer order by buying or selling a security from an account in which the broker has an interest.a broker trades ahead or frontruns when he or she receives a large order for a particular security from an institutional client and,before executing the larger trade,first executes trades in that security for an account in which the broker has an interest so as to anticipate and exploit the movement in price the larger trade is likely to cause.in addition,nyse rules,and,which implement the provisions for brokers and dealers contained in and,require floor brokers to retain all of their trading orders for three years.
in,the and his into a business relationship with the oakford corporation.they concede that until february,they flipped stocks for,and had a arrangement with,oakford.under the agreement with oakford,and his firm were to receive seventy percent of net profits from oakford trades,and were to absorb seventy percent of the account losses.concedes that he did not know directly of other brokers with this sort of arrangement,that he did not recall asking anyone at the exchange whether it was permissible,and that he had only a general sense of the rules barring trading by a floor broker for an account in which the broker had an interest.nyse hearing of,at.
along with petitioners seventy percent interest in the oakford account,also had discretion over trades for the account.he used this discretion to cross trades for oakford benefit.and was vested with discretion to decide how many shares of a particular security he would trade for oakford.at least once,changed the number of shares in an existing oakford order without first contacting oakford.the petitioners gave the oakford account preferential treatment,frontrunning other customers for the benefit of the oakford account.
neither nor his firm complied with commission regulations or exchange rules requiring brokers to maintain specified trading records.see nyse rule.instead of keeping the records required by these detailed rules,see,nyse rule a requiring exchange members to preserve for at least three years all trading orders transmitted or carried to the exchange floor,kept a box at his booth on the trading floor in which he put order tickets.as he himself described it,he threw away the contents w henever the box got full.nyse hearing of,at.the amount contained in the box at any one time,he said,could have been a year worth,year and a half worth,it could have been less.id.the petitioners wisely do not seek to convince us that these practices complied with commission regulations or nyse rules.
criminal proceedings 
on february,federal law enforcement officials it is difficult to determine from the record who arrested on a charge of violating section a.on the same day,the exchange summarily suspended and his firm from exchange membership and access to exchange services.the exchange acted based upon floor brokerage activities involving oakford also on the same day,the commission filed a civil action against,among others,and his firm.see oakford,litigation release,docket,wl,sec lexis,
meanwhile,the government instituted criminal proceedings against oakford,and other floor brokers associated with oakford in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.defendants other than pleaded guilty,see united states oakford,d,while the charges against were dismissed pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement,nyse,cir but in an opinion and order in connection with the sentencing of defendants in the case,the district court jed rakoff,judge observed that the exchange interpretation of section a prohibition of discretionary trading by a floor broker,which deemed a trade chosen by a floor broker not discretionary so long as the broker notified the customer of the trade prior to making it,was anemic and made a mockery of the statutory language.oakford,d at.
sec proceedings against the exchange 
at about the time the criminal proceedings against the defendants were underway,the commission launched an investigation into trading practices on the exchange floor.it concluded that as a result of,among other things,improperly restrictive rule interpretations,the exchange had allowed independent floor brokers to disregard securities laws and exchange rules.letter from lori richards,director,sec office of compliance inspections and examinations,to richard grasso,chairman and chief executive officer,nyse.on june,pursuant to a settlement agreement with the exchange,the commission issued an order concluding that the exchange had been lax in policing trading by independent for trading involving accounts in which the brokers had an interest.the order instructed the exchange to enforce the relevant rules.nyse,exchange act release,docket,wl,at,sec lexis,at june.
the petitioners lawsuit 
on december,and his firm instituted a lawsuit in the supreme court of new york,new york county,against the exchange and three exchange officials chairman richard grasso,group executive for market surveillance edward kwalwasser,and senior for market surveillance robert mcsweeney.the complaint,which sought million in damages,alleged tort and claims based on alleged misconduct by the exchange and its officials.drawing on the commission investigation and criticism of exchange enforcement of section a and related regulations,as well as on judge rakoff prior criticism of the exchange interpretation of discretion,oakford,d at,and his firm alleged that their unlawful trading was a byproduct of the actions of the exchange and its officers in disseminating a knowingly incorrect interpretation of the relevant statutes and exchange rules and in concealing that fact from the office of the united states attorney for the southern district of new york.the defendants removed the action to the united states district court for the southern district of new york.although the complaint alleged only claims,the district court concluded that it had removal jurisdiction under franchise tax board construction laborers vacation trust,d,and smith kansas city title trust,because and his firm right to relief under state law necessarily depended on resolution of a substantial question of federal law,namely,the construction of section a and related sec regulations.see frayler nyse,d,asserting removal jurisdiction over similar tort suit against the exchange by an independent floor broker id.at applying analysis from frayler to sua sponte review of the removability of and his firm suit.the district court ultimately dismissed the action on the grounds that,having been sued in their regulatory capacities,the defendants enjoyed absolute immunity.nyse,d,aff,cir.
the exchange charges against the petitioners 
in the meantime,on december,almost two weeks after and his firm filed their complaint in new york state supreme court,the exchange formally charged them with disciplinary violations,including violations of section a,rule,and nyse rules a,a,and a prohibiting floor brokers from engaging in proprietary and discretionary trading nyse rule crossing trades nyse rule frontrunning and nyse rule and exchange act rules and requirements.the first step in the exchange disciplinary process is a proceeding before a hearing panel consisting of one hearing officer employed by the exchange and two members of the exchange.see nyse const.art.ix,available at http last visited.in petitioners case,the hearing panel exchange,the panel members other than the hearing floor brokers like they were not exchange employees.
the petitioners made a motion before the hearing panel arguing that the nyse and its employees must disqualify itself sic from this entire matter.the matter should be immediately referred to an outside arbitrator.letter from dominic amorosa,for petitioners,to rosetta alter,hearing board manager,nyse.the petitioners argued that because their concurrent lawsuit against the nyse was adverse to both the exchange and its highest officers,all exchange employees suffered from a conflict of interest with respect to the petitioners.the exchange hearing only exchange employee on the hearing the motion and declined to recuse himself.
in an effort to establish that the kind of profit sharing arrangement between the petitioners and oakford had been sanctioned by the exchange and his firm sought to call grasso,kwalwasser,and mcsweeney as witnesses.the hearing officer denied this request,ruling that their testimony would be repetitive and cumulative because other exchange employees had testified that the trading practices in which and his firm had engaged were prohibited.
in a decision dated november,the panel concluded that and his firm had knowingly violated the law by,among other things,having an interest in the oakford account,giving the oakford account preferential treatment,and engaging in discretionary trading on behalf of the account.nyse exchange hearing panel decision,at.it censured both and his firm.id.at.it barred them from allied membership,approved person status,and from employment or association in any capacity with any member or member organization for a period of seven years.id.the petitioners were also permanently barred from membership employment on the floor of the exchange in any capacity.id.
two weeks later,the petitioners appealed the panel decision to the nyse board of directors.during the pendency of the appeal,the petitioners again insisted that the nyse must disqualify itself from these proceedings and the matter must be referred to an independent arbiter at once.letter from dominic amorosa,for petitioners,to karalene gayle,assistant general counsel,nyse.the board declined to do so.the two management directors on the board,one of whom was richard grasso,did,however,recuse themselves the board then affirmed the decision of the hearing panel.
sec review 
on april,the petitioners sought commission review of the board ruling pursuant to d,e.on august,during the pendency of the appeal,harvey pitt was appointed chairman of the commission.pitt,as a lawyer in private practice,had represented the exchange in petitioners action.on may,counsel for and his firm wrote to the commission to inquire whether pitt had any responsibility with respect to his appeal.two days later,pitt recused himself.
six months later,pitt resigned as sec chairman.but on december,the petitioners moved to disqualify the entire commission based on the nomination of former exchange chairman william donaldson to be chairman of the commission.donaldson also eventually recused himself,so notifying the petitioners on march.the commission did not,however,recuse itself as an agency with respect to the petitioners appeal.
on april,the commission issued an order sustaining the decision of the exchange board affirming the ruling of the hearing panel.in an opinion accompanying the order,the commission said that it was bas ing its findings upon an independent review of the record.john,exchange act release,docket,wl,at,sec lexis,at april.after a lengthy discussion of the facts underlying the case,the commission concluded that and his firm had committed the violations of which they had been found guilty by the exchange,wl,at,sec lexis,at.the commission also concluded that the petitioners allegations that the exchange tacitly encouraged the kind of relationship and his firm had had with oakford were not substantiated by the record,wl,at,sec lexis,at.the commission then considered and rejected the petitioners argument that the exchange proceedings were fundamentally unfair because of the exchange alleged partiality,wl,at,sec lexis,at.first,the commission rejected the petitioners argument that the exchange disciplinary proceedings were in retaliation for the petitioners bringing suit against the exchange,wl,at,sec lexis,at.the commission noted that although the exchange initiated the proceedings two weeks after the petitioners filed their suit against it,the exchange had also,during the period prior to the petitioners filing in state court,engaged in a wide range of acts preparatory to its filing of charges against and his firm,wl,at,sec lexis,at.second,the comission,relying on sloan nyse,cir,concluded that the fact that the petitioners had brought suit against the exchange did not preclude the exchange from instituting disciplinary proceedings against them,wl,at,sec lexis,at.the commission also found that the petitioners had offered no evidence of the exchange board partiality.in any event,the commission reasoned,its de novo review provided ample protection from any claimed partiality or bias on the part of the exchange,wl,at,sec lexis,at.the commission also rejected the petitioners insistence that the sec was required to recuse itself in favor of an independent arbiter,wl,at,sec lexis,at.
as for the petitioners claim that they were victims of selective prosecution by the exchange and that they had received disproportionately harsh sanctions,the commission noted that it has consistently held that the propriety of an sanction is highly and can not be determined by comparison with action taken in other cases,wl,at,sec lexis,at.the commission decided that,on the particular facts of this case,the petitioners had violated the principles of commercial honor and trust that are the hallmark of the exchange auction market system.their violations go to the heart of the duties a floor broker owes a customer,wl,at,sec lexis,at.the commission concluded that the exchange sanctions imposed against the petitioners were fully warranted,wl,at,sec lexis,at.
on may,and his firm filed a petition in this court pursuant to a and for review of the commission order.they argue that the order should be vacated on the grounds that the exchange hearing officer who presided over the petitioners disciplinary hearing suffered from a conflict of interest with respect to the petitioners and therefore should have recused himself the sec commissioners were barred by their conflict of interest from hearing the case and the disciplinary sanctions imposed on and his firm by the exchange were disproportionately harsh in comparison to the sanctions imposed in similar cases.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing the sec opinion and order,we must affirm t he findings of the commission as to the facts,if supported by substantial evidence.valicenti advisory,sec,cir quoting a alteration in original,cert.denied,d a.the administrative procedure act,which applies to our review of commission orders,see,domestic,sec,provides that a reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
ii.alleged conflicts of interest 
a.the exchange 
the petitioners argue that due process required that the hearing officer on the hearing panel that conducted their disciplinary hearings recuse himself.because and his firm had previously filed suit in state court against the exchange,the petitioners argue,all exchange employees,including the hearing officer,were biased against the petitioners and incapable of giving them a fair hearing we conclude that the argument is ill conceived and that the exchange was not in error in concluding that such alleged partiality on the part of the hearing officer did not render the exchange disciplinary proceedings against and his firm unfair or invalid.
as we observe in mfs securities sec,wl cir,decided today 
under the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments,parties and the public are entitled to tribunals free of personal bias.in re murchison.see also chew dietrich,cir.observing that the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments create equivalent requirements for most purposes,cert.denied,d.this requirement is applicable to administrative agencies such as the commission in much the same way as it is applicable to courts.see gibson berryhill,d.
the petitioners assume,without elaboration,that such a requirement applies to exchange disciplinary proceedings.that is,however,not self evident 
but whatever the merits of the constitutional argument,we need not reach it today.federal statute requires,as a condition of registration as a national securities exchange,that the rules of the exchange in general,provide a fair procedure for the disciplining of members and persons associated with members.b see also silver nyse,d congress in effecting a scheme of designed to insure fair dealing can not be thought to have sanctioned and protected a activity when carried out in a fundamentally unfair manner.whatever else section b requirement of a fair procedure means,and whether or not it incorporates all due process requirements that would bind an agency of the federal government,we think that provision of a fair procedure in sro disciplinary proceedings gives rise to a requirement that the be impartial.thus,whether the norm arises out of the statute or the constitution,we conclude that impartial adjudicators are required.the analysis we make when the impartiality of the exchange is challenged is thus similar to that which we employ when the impartiality of the commission is challenged,as it is both here and in mfs securities,at,wl,decided today.
we conclude that the hearing officer participation in the petitioners disciplinary proceeding did not render the proceeding unfair.the petitioners theory is that because they were concurrently suing the exchange and senior exchange officials,and because their allegations in that suit had the potential to embarrass the exchange and those officials,the hearing officer was biased against the petitioners the hearing officer would not want to incur the disfavor of his superiors by finding for parties who were directly adverse to them in litigation charging the superiors with misbehavior.we think that to be insufficient to establish bias.
we assume that if an exchange official is the specific target of a civil lawsuit brought by an exchange member,that official should not participate as a hearing officer in exchange disciplinary proceedings against the member.the official interests would in such a case likely be directly adverse to the exchange member.but the petitioners do not allege that the hearing officer here bore any personal animus toward them,nor do they allege that he had anything even resembling a direct financial stake in the outcome of the disciplinary proceeding.they have adduced no evidence tending to show that the interests of the hearing officer himself were directly adverse to the petitioners or amounted to a personal stake in the outcome of the civil suit.of course an exchange employee who acts as a hearing officer may want to please his or her superiors who are themselves embroiled in litigation.but we think that that alone is far too attenuated an interest to cast a shadow on the employee impartiality.as we observe today in mfs securities,at,wl,the bias of one member of a regulatory agency generally does not spread throughout the agency.we similarly conclude that the bias or attitude of senior exchange officials does not invariably trickle down to all employees at all levels of the exchange.
our conclusion in this regard is consistent with our decision in sloan nyse,cir.there,the exchange had brought a civil action against several of its members.the members had asserted counterclaims.the exchange concurrently instituted an internal disciplinary proceeding against the members.the members sought to enjoin the proceeding on the ground that the exchange hearing officer was not impartial because the exchange and the members oppose one another in a separate civil action in which the charges brought in the disciplinary proceeding are material.id.at.we affirmed the district court denial of preliminary injunctive relief,noting that the interests of the hearing p anel members are sufficiently attenuated from the outcome of the proceeding to make the possibility of partiality quite remote.id.at.
if disciplinary proceedings were to come to a halt whenever an exchange sought relief in a civil suit and the defendant counterclaimed,th e regulatory framework would be undermined.mfs securities,at,wl we can not require,as a matter of constitutional law,that administrative tribunals disqualify themselves for the most theoretical and remote of reasons.to do so might well impair their ability to fulfill their congressionally imposed adjudicative functions.
finally,acceptance of the petitioners theory would give rise to a perverse incentive for exchange members,when fearing possible exchange disciplinary proceedings and desiring to disqualify exchange members in any such adjudication,to strike preemptively in the courtroom against the exchange.we can discern no legitimate goal to be served by encouraging such litigation.
the commission did not abuse its discretion in affirming the order of the exchange in this regard.
b.the commission 
the petitioners further argue that even though chairmen pitt and donaldson recused themselves from personal involvement in the petitioners appeal to the commission,because pitt had represented the exchange in the civil lawsuit brought by the petitioners against the commission,and because donaldson was a former chairman of the exchange,the commission as an institution could not be impartial with respect to the petitioners appeal.the petitioners therefore insist that the commission was required to disqualify itself in this matter in favor of an independent arbitrator.today,in mfs securities,we denied a virtually identical claim.mfs,at,wl.for the reasons stated there,we reject the petitioner argument here.
to be sure,the petitioners have raised a question of the timing of chairman pitt recusal that was not present in mfs securities.they did so for the first time,however,in their reply brief.a rguments raised for the first time in an appellate reply brief are not properly before the court.unit
