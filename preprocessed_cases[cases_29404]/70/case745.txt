introduction 
the trial court entered the defaults of four defendants as a sanction for their discovery abuses.default judgment was entered against them in an amount exceeding million,and the defendants appealed.
we reverse the judgment because the defendants did not receive notice their defaults might be entered as a discovery sanction and were not provided an opportunity to be heard on the matter.the defendants were denied due process because sanctions for the abuse or misuse of discovery may not be awarded ex parte.code civ,subd.b.the notice of motion for the discovery sanctions was also deficient,subd.c.thus,the orders entering the defendants defaults and the subsequent default judgment are void.
