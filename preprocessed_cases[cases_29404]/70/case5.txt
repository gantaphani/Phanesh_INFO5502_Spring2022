this case requires us to determine whether a prisoner against whom a federal detainer has been lodged and who is erroneously detained by state authorities following the dismissal of state criminal charges is in federal custody for purposes of the speedy trial act,b.we conclude that the appellant did not enter federal custody until october,the date on which he was arrested by united states marshals and brought before a federal judge.as such,his october,indictment occurred within thirty days of his arrest on federal charges and,therefore,did not violate the speedy trial act.we also reject the appellant claim that the district court erred by failing to impose any sanctions against the federal government as a result of its purported failure to notify him that it had lodged a federal detainer against him.
background 
the facts of this matter are relatively straightforward.the parties stipulated to many of them and neither party challenges any of the additional facts found by the district court.on august,deputies of the cumberland county sheriff office arrested michael lewis appellant at a gravel pit in standish,maine it appears that at the time of his arrest the appellant had a firearm on him,and that he had been convicted of at least one felony in the past.following his arrest,the state of maine state charged appellant with the following criminal counts possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of a theft by receiving stolen property in violation of a b and carrying a concealed weapon in violation of a b.the appellant was granted but did not post bail for reasons not appearing in the record.thus,he remained in the state custody at the cumberland county jail.
during the afternoon of friday,august,the united states government filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of maine charging the appellant with one count of violation of g,possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.an arrest warrant on the federal charges was issued that same day.later that afternoon the government prosecutor contacted the state prosecutor to advise him that a federal complaint had been filed against the appellant.the state prosecutor responded that he would promptly dismiss the related state charges.the government prosecutor also told the appellant defense counsel that a complaint against his client had been filed in federal court.the record does not reveal whether the government also informed defense counsel that it had been advised the state intended to dismiss its charges promptly.
the government lodged a federal detainer at the cumberland county jail at on the next business day,monday,august,later that same day,the state voluntarily dismissed all its charges against the appellant.what occurred next or,more accurately,failed to occur sets the stage for this appeal.
the parties stipulated as to the procedures generally followed by the cumberland county jail when a federal detainer is lodged against one of its inmates.once the jail is advised that the state charges have been dismissed,it contacts the united states marshals service to let them know the state charges are no longer pending the marshals service in turn notifies both the appropriate united states district court and the united states attorney office.thus,had the normal and customary practice been adhered to in this instance,the jail should have received notice of the dismissal of state charges on or soon after august and passed this information along to the united states marshals so the appellant could be placed into federal custody.
there is no question that the customary procedures broke down in this case,as the appellant languished in the cumberland county jail for the next month.during this time,the jail never notified the united states marshals service that the state charges had been dismissed.as the marshals were not informed of the dismissal,they did not notify the attorney office that the state charges had been dismissed and that the appellant should be taken into federal custody.thus,the appellant remained incarcerated by the state despite the fact it had dismissed all charges against him.
the record does not provide any hint as to how long this state of affairs would have persisted if not for the intervention of an outside actor.finally,on september,the appellant girlfriend phoned the attorney office,stated that all state charges had been dismissed,and inquired as to why the appellant was still sitting in the cumberland county jail it appears this phone call prompted action on the appellant case,as the government prosecutor assigned to the case telephoned the jail that same day.officials at the jail told her the appellant was still being held on the state charges.during this conversation the jail specifically informed the government prosecutor it was not holding the appellant as a result of the federal detainer.
also on september,the government prosecutor contacted the state prosecutor via electronic mail to inquire as to the status of the state charges.the state attorney reported that the state charges were dismissed on august,and in reply the government prosecutor stated the jail was still holding the appellant on the state charges.from the tenor of the email messages introduced as exhibits at the district court,it certainly appears the state attorneys were completely unaware that the appellant was still in state custody.in further email correspondence on tuesday,september,the state prosecutor informed the government prosecutor that he would contact the state court to verify it had received the state dismissal.he also promised to ask the state court to notify the jail of the dropped charges.
while the record shows that there was some additional email correspondence between the state and government attorneys regarding the status of the case over the next several days,no official action was taken and the appellant remained in state custody for the next week.finally,on october,the state prosecutor called the state court to have a copy of the dismissal faxed to the jail.the state attorney then confirmed with an officer at the cumberland county jail that the jail had in fact received notification of the dismissal,and he advised the government prosecutor of these developments through email.
apparently,once the jail finally received notice of the dismissal on october,it promptly contacted the united states marshals in accordance with its usual protocol.thereafter the government acted swiftly,as on the same day it arrested the appellant on the federal warrant and brought him before a federal judge for his initial appearance a federal grand jury returned a indictment on october,charging the appellant with violating g.the appellant remained in federal custody between october and october,as he waived his right to contest the government motion to detain him pending trial.
the appellant subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the federal indictment for violation of the speedy trial act and for an alleged violation of his right to a speedy trial under the sixth amendment of the united states constitution.the appellant argued that even though he was being held at a state facility from august to october,the dismissal of all state charges and the lodging of the federal detainer on august,was the functional equivalent of an arrest by federal authorities.the appellant took the position that the indictment should be dismissed because it was not issued within thirty days from the date federal custody began,as the act requires.
the district court held a hearing and denied the appellant motion on january.two days later,and with the government consent,the appellant entered a conditional guilty plea whereby he reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss.the district court approved and entered the conditional plea on february.judgment entered on may.this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
the appellant insists that the lodging of the federal detainer on the morning of august,combined with the dismissal of state charges later that day,acted as a de facto arrest by federal authorities that triggered the arrest to indictment time limit under the speedy trial act,b.in the appellant view,once the state dismissed its charges against him,the federal detainer became the functional equivalent of an arrest because it was the sole legitimate basis for the state to continue holding him.using august as the starting point,he then argues that the government violated the act by failing to indict him within thirty days,necessitating dismissal of the indictment 
separately,the appellant posits that the government also violated the act by failing to notify him of the detainer.while conceding that dismissal of the indictment is not an appropriate remedy for any such violation,the appellant asks us to remand this matter to the district court for imposition of an appropriate sanction.
in rejoinder,the government argues that the speedy trial act does not apply until an individual is arrested or served with a summons with respect to a federal crime.according to the government,the federal detainer did not function as a federal arrest because the state continued to exercise jurisdiction over the appellant.the government further argues that the appellant was never in custody as a result of a federal charge prior to october,because the cumberland county jail was actually holding him on the state charges.the government,therefore,argues that because the arrest to indictment time limit did not begin to count down until october,the october indictment came well within the speedy trial act deadline.
as to the appellant request for sanctions,the government argues that this appeal constitutes the first time he has sought any sanction other than dismissal.therefore,the government urges us to find the appellant has waived any objections to the district court failure to impose sanctions.
speedy trial act 
the district court denial of a motion to dismiss predicated upon the speedy trial act is reviewed de novo with respect to questions of law.united states maryea,cir.factual findings,however,will only be overturned where there has been clear error.id.the parties here have stipulated to many of the operative facts,and neither party has challenged any of the facts found by the district court at the hearing on the motion to dismiss.as such,we review the legal questions de novo.
the main thrust of the appellant appeal is centered on the arrest to indictment time limit set forth in the speedy trial act,b.the critical question to be answered is whether or not the lodging of the federal detainer at the cumberland county jail prior to the dismissal of state charges constituted a federal arrest so as to begin the countdown.this issue is dispositive,as the government october,indictment clearly did not comply with the speedy trial act if the clock began ticking on august.
federal detainers 
our analysis begins with the statutory language.the speedy trial act provides,in pertinent part,that a ny information or indictment charging an individual with the commission of an offense shall be filed within thirty days from the date on which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection with such charges.b.the term offense is defined as any federal criminal offense which is in violation of any act of congress and is triable by any court established by act of congress,with certain exceptions not relevant here.pursuant to the clear statutory language,the act applies solely to individuals who have been arrested or served with a summons in connection with an alleged federal crime.see united states kelly,cir the act,by its terms,applies only where there is an arrest or service of a summons in connection with the relevant federal charges.quoting b,cert.denied.thus,only that class of individuals is entitled to the arrest to indictment requirement set forth in section b 
the record establishes that the appellant august,arrest was effectuated by state deputies and resulted in him being charged with violations of state law.following that arrest,he was held in state custody at the cumberland county jail after failing to post bail.
although the state dismissed its charges against the appellant on august,the record is devoid of any evidence that the cumberland county jail was notified of the dismissal in a timely manner.to the contrary,one possible conclusion emerges from the record.the jail was not told the charges had been dismissed.consequently,the jail continued to hold the appellant because the jail officials operated on the assumption he was still facing state charges,and not because of the federal detainer.indeed,this is precisely what jail officials told the government prosecutor on september,when she called to inquire about the appellant continued detention.
clearly,the email exhibits submitted to the district court reveal that the jail was not aware at all that the state charges had been dismissed until the state prosecutor asked the state court to fax a copy of the dismissal to the jail on october.the record shows that once this was done,the jail promptly advised the united states marshals of the dismissal.the marshals in turn swiftly arrested and took custody of the appellant and brought him in front of a federal judge for his initial appearance,all of which occurred on october.
based on these undisputed facts,we conclude the appellant was in state custody though perhaps unlawfully from the time of his august,arrest by state sheriff deputies through october.during that time,he was subject only to the jurisdiction of the state of maine.it was not until the united states marshals service took custody of the appellant on october,that he was arrested in connection with federal charges.accordingly,and pursuant to the plain language of the act,the arrest to indictment clock did not begin to count down until october.
and the appellant speedy trial act argument simply can not be reconciled with the clear statutory language.we have recognized that the act sets rules.united states hood,cir.other circuits have noted that the speedy trial act is intended to mandate an orderly and expeditious procedure for federal criminal prosecutions by fixing specific,mechanical time limits within which the various progressions in the prosecution must occur.united states iaquinta,cir see also united states shahryar,cir.
consistent with its mechanical nature,the act sets forth a very clear trigger for the time limit the date on which a defendant is arrested or served with a summons in connection with a federal offense.b.the lodging of a federal detainer is conspicuously absent from the list of triggering events.this absence was not an oversight or mistake,as a subsequent provision of the act specifically addresses federal detainers and the procedures that are to be employed in the event a detainer is lodged against an individual already serving a prison sentence.see j requiring the person with custody of a prisoner against whom a federal detainer has been lodged to advise that person of the charge and the right to demand trial thereon see also kelly,at the act addresses individuals charged with federal crimes who are already serving a term of imprisonment.
given the explicit reference to federal detainers elsewhere in the act,it is clear congress was well aware of their existence when it drafted the act and,specifically,section b.the dictates of section b are clear.had congress intended for the lodging of a federal detainer to begin the countdown,it would have included detainers as a triggering event along with arrests and summonses.as congress elected not to do so,it is not for this court to substitute its judgment for that of congress and rewrite the statute.
appellant proposed knowledge test 
we move on to the appellant request that we impute a knowledge test to the act.according to the appellant,the countdown should begin on the date the government knew or should have known the appellant was being held due to the detainer and not the state charges.in urging us to adopt this trigger one not contained anywhere in the act the appellant relies on the opinion of the fourth circuit court of appeals in united states woolfolk,cir.in woolfolk the fourth circuit concluded that the clock begins to tick when the government knows or should know that an individual is
