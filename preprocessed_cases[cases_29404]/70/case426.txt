background 
mhtc is an agency of the state of missouri responsible for the maintenance and care of the state highway system.the missouri department of transportation modot is an organization operating under the control of mhtc that carries out the construction and maintenance of state roadways.jerry wheeler was employed by modot as a maintenance worker in and.in may,wheeler applied for a permanent position.wheeler and nine other candidates were interviewed.one of the female candidates,terri williams,was hired.
mhtc states that the candidates were asked the same questions and that the hiring decision was based on the experience and background of the applicants together with the interview.williams did very well in her interview,mhtc asserts,whereas wheeler was upset and agitated and raised his voice to the interviewers,indicating that he was going to be very upset if a female were hired for the job.one of the interviewers,scott stone,testified that wheeler behavior reminded stone of an incident in when wheeler exhibited similar angry and confrontational behavior.
wheeler alleges that williams was much less qualified than he was.he asserts that williams was specially sought out to fill the position,and that modot did not follow standard employment procedures in hiring williams.wheeler contends that the hiring was discriminatory because it was based on gender and not on the merits of the candidates.
on june,wheeler filed a title vii gender discrimination claim against mhtc.wheeler claim was tried before a jury which found that the hiring decision was motivated by gender and therefore discriminatory.they also found,however,that mhtc would not have hired wheeler even if there had been no discrimination.thus,wheeler was awarded no actual damages.
both parties made motions.mhtc brought motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial.wheeler brought motions to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to.e for a new trial for sanctions and relief from judgment pursuant to.and for attorney fees.all motions were denied except wheeler motion for attorney fees,which the district court reduced to 
ii.mhtc appeal 
mhtc appeals on two grounds.first,mhtc argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law because there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict that mhtc decision not to hire wheeler was discriminatory.second,mhtc appeals the district court refusal to grant a new trial.it argues that the district court abused its discretion in allowing wheeler to admit evidence of mhtc affirmative action plan aap,given that there was insufficient evidence in the record that mhtc acted pursuant to the plan.
sufficiency of the evidence 
we review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,using the same standard as the district court.ogden wax works,cir.we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,resolving all conflicts in the evidence in wheeler favor and assuming as proved all facts that his evidence tended to show.in addition,we must give the party the benefit of all favorable inferences that may be reasonably drawn from the facts proved.hathaway runyon,cir.
mhtc asserts that the only evidence of discrimination at trial was its affirmative action plan.mhtc argues that it can not be held liable for discrimination by acting pursuant to a valid aap.see christensen equitable life assurance soc y,cir noting that a lawful affirmative action program is not evidence of discrimination,cert.denied,d.
we find mhtc assertion to be unconvincing.in numerous discussions both before and during the trial,the district court stated that the issue was not the existence and validity of the aap,but the relative merits and qualifications of the two individuals.as the district court noted,mhtc agreed with this theory of the case and chose to defend the case on the merits of the hiring decision,without reference or refuge to an affirmative action plan.accordingly,the district court granted mhtc motion in limine to exclude evidence of the aap.the only evidence of the aap the district court allowed was wheeler inquiry on as to whether the aap played any role in the interviewer hiring decision.
mhtc seems to equate wheeler evidence of pressure from upper level management to hire females as evidence of the aap.this is inaccurate.evidence of illegal and discriminatory motive to hire on the basis of sex and not on the merits of the candidates is distinct from evidence of a valid aap.the basis of wheeler argument was not that mhtc acted pursuant to the aap,which he conceded was valid,but that there was pressure from upper management to hire females in violation of the aap commitment to equal employment opportunity standards,which led to the discriminatory hiring.
wheeler supported this theory of the case with evidence independent of the aap,including testimony of one of the interviewers that wheeler qualifications were much better than williams,that normal interview procedures were not followed,and that,in his opinion,equal employment opportunity procedures were not followed testimony of two of the three interviewers that they felt pressure to recommend the female employee because she was female,despite the fact that they felt wheeler had better qualifications testimony of wheeler supervisor that he told wheeler that he would be lucky to get the job because it was widely known that they were going to hire a lady testimony that williams was especially sought out for the position and evidence that wheeler was more experienced and skilled for the position than williams.we find that this evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict of discrimination.
based on the foregoing discussion,we also find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant mhtc a new trial.while mhtc asserts that the district court erroneously admitted evidence of the aap,even assuming it was admitted erroneously,the evidence was not so prejudicial that a new trial would produce a different result.see bevan honeywell,cir.a new trial is not warranted on the basis of an evidentiary ruling unless the evidence was so prejudicial that a new trial would likely produce a different result.wheeler offered evidence,independent of the aap,sufficient to support the jury verdict of discrimination.
iii.wheeler 
wheeler argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion by dictating the theory of wheeler case and wrongfully excluding evidence that wheeler needed to prove his case.wheeler also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying wheeler motions to amend his pleadings to include declaratory and injunctive relief,and in calculating his attorney fee award.
dictation of the case and evidence allowed 
wheeler cites in a rambling brief,which is difficult to understand,a great number of instances in which he believes the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence and dictating the theory of his case.for purposes of our analysis,these alleged abuses may be divided into two categories those abuses relating to the discrimination phase of the case,and those relating to the same decision verdict.
excluded evidence and abuses relating to discrimination 
there is no reason to discuss wheeler numerous allegations of erroneously excluded evidence and unfair adverse rulings regarding discrimination for the simple reason
