projects management company pmc appeals from the district court dismissal of its suit against dyncorp international llc dyncorp.the district court dismissed pmc suit on two alternate grounds first,as a sanction for pmc repeated discovery abuses and second,based on its conclusion that pmc was seeking damages contrary to the measure of damages provided by law.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
dyncorp contracted with the united states department of state to assist in the development of a civilian police force in iraq.in connection with this contract,dyncorp entered into a subcontract with pmc the subcontract for operations and maintenance support in iraq between august,and february,with an option to extend performance to february.pmc executed the subcontract with dyncorp through its managing director,hussein fawaz,who was also represented to dyncorp as having an ownership interest in pmc.the subcontract identified pmc project manager greg byers as pmc point of contact with dyncorp 
the subcontract provided that pmc would periodically invoice dyncorp and that dyncorp would,within days of the date of each invoice,tender periodic payments to pmc by making a wire transfer directly to an account held by pmc at kuwait gulf bank the kuwait account.the subcontract also provided that n o oral statement of any person shall modify or otherwise affect the terms,conditions,or specifications stated in this subcontract.pmc began its performance under the subcontract and listed payment instructions on the face of each invoice sent to dyncorp.the invoices were paid by dyncorp according to those payment instructions,which were consistent with the payment information in the subcontract.in december,pmc invoices began directing dyncorp to make payments to a new bank account at the national bank of kuwait lebanon located in beirut,lebanon and held in the name of fawaz the lebanon account.dyncorp personnel contacted pmc through fawaz and byers to confirm that future payments should be made to the lebanon account rather than the kuwait account.fawaz responded to dyncorp with a letter written on pmc letterhead directing dyncorp to make its payments to the lebanon account.byers also responded to dyncorp by email,confirming the change in payment instructions and stating that all pmc invoices would list the correct banking information on their face.another pmc employee,acting at the direction of fawaz and byers,followed up with dyncorp to confirm that future payments should be made to the lebanon account.dyncorp then began making payments to the lebanon account,as directed in the pmc invoices.pmc did not inform dyncorp of any problems with its payments.
near the end of the initial subcontract term,dyncorp and pmc,through greg byers,agreed to exercise the option to extend the term of the subcontract,including a provision that a ll other terms and conditions remain the same.after several months of continuing performance under the subcontract,dyncorp issued a cure notice to pmc,notifying pmc of performance issues under the subcontract and providing pmc with an opportunity to remedy its performance.shortly thereafter,dyncorp terminated the subcontract and requested a termination settlement proposal from pmc.in response,pmc requested a payment of,claiming in unpaid invoices and in other costs and expenses.the parties did not reach a settlement agreement.
after the termination of the subcontract,dyncorp was apprised that fawaz was not,in fact,a part owner of pmc.it was further revealed that pmc true owners were members of the al muhanna family of kuwait,most notably rabea al muhanna,who pmc contends had sole authority over the financial affairs of pmc.
on january,pmc sued dyncorp in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia under the court diversity jurisdiction,alleging breach of contract,aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty,and business conspiracy.specifically,pmc alleged that dyncorp breached its contract with pmc by making payments to the lebanon account instead of the kuwait account.after a conference,the parties submitted a discovery plan,representing that all discovery would be completed by april.the district court set a trial date of august.during discovery,dyncorp learned that at least some of the funds it had paid into the lebanon account had been used to pay obligations of pmc.in particular,dyncorp learned that pmc primary subcontractor in iraq,cater corp,had received significant payments from the lebanon account.
after the close of discovery,dyncorp moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the subcontract had been modified to permit instructions on each individual invoice submitted by pmc to dyncorp to determine the account into which dyncorp payments were to be made.the district court granted partial summary judgment to dyncorp,concluding that the parties method of changing banking instructions on the face of pmc invoices complied with the requirements in the subcontract for modification.the district court denied summary judgment in part by expressly declining to conclude that either fawaz or byers had actual or apparent authority to modify the payment instructions in the subcontract because genuine issues of material fact remained to be decided at trial as to that issue.
on may,following the district court summary judgment order and the close of discovery,pmc disclosed its damages calculation.pmc claimed in total damages,of which represented the entire amount previously paid by dyncorp into the lebanon account.the remaining was for unpaid invoices that remained outstanding.dyncorp and pmc later settled pmc claim with respect to the of unpaid invoices.thus,only the million that dyncorp paid into the lebanon account is at issue here.
dyncorp filed a motion in limine to preclude pmc from presenting its damages calculation at trial.dyncorp argued that pmc improperly withheld its damages calculation until after the close of discovery,leaving dyncorp with no ability to take discovery relating to damages or to address the damages issues on summary judgment.in addition,dyncorp argued that pmc damages calculation was contrary to law because it failed to account for millions of dollars paid from the lebanon account to pmc employees and subcontractors in satisfaction of pmc obligations.further,dyncorp argued that pmc had intentionally withheld documents showing that funds were paid from the lebanon account to satisfy pmc obligations with the contemporaneous knowledge of pmc owners.
dyncorp also moved the district court to impose sanctions against pmc under the court inherent authority to sanction a party for abusing the judicial process,as recognized in united states shaffer equipment,cir.dyncorp argued that sanctions were warranted because pmc had concealed documents during discovery that evidenced pmc knowledge of and acquiescence to fawaz use of the lebanon account to administer the subcontract and pay pmc subcontractors and employees.in support of its motion,dyncorp represented that it received documents from a third party indicating that pmc participated in fawaz use of the lebanon account.only after dyncorp received these documents,and long after the close of discovery,did pmc produce an additional pages of documents demonstrating that pmc acquiesced to fawaz use of the lebanon account.this late production,dyncorp argued,prevented it from taking meaningful depositions of pmc rule b representatives,rabea al muhanna and philip zacharia,and deprived dyncorp of access to evidence critical to its summary judgment motion.dyncorp also posited that pmc documents revealed that pmc rule b provided false or misleading testimony and that pmc provided false interrogatory answers.
the district court conducted hearings on dyncorp motions and granted the motion for sanctions,finding that pmc failed to produce relevant and requested documents in a timely manner.finding that the factors listed in shaffer equipment were applicable,the district court held that pmc failure of discovery warrant ed the imposition of sanctions.although dyncorp had requested that the district court dismiss pmc claim as sanctions for pmc discovery abuse,the district court declined to do so.instead,the district court ordered pmc to produce both of its rule b designees for additional depositions before august,at a place of dyncorp choosing,costs to be borne by pmc.the district court further ordered that the factual substance of each document be deemed admitted pursuant to rule c c of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court deferred any further decision on dyncorp motion for sanctions,holding in abeyance any decision to award a monetary sanction against pmc for its discovery defalcation,and deferred its decision on dyncorp motion in limine,pending the parties sic submission of further briefs related to the proper measure of damages and the timeliness of pmc disclosure of this measure.
pmc filed for a protective order to relieve it from having to produce zacharia for deposition and from having to produce al muhanna until august,two days before the trial date.dyncorp renewed its motion in limine on the damages issue and again sought dismissal of the case under the district court inherent authority to impose sanctions.the district court found that the partial remedies it had previously imposed had failed to ameliorat e the significant prejudice to dyncorp stemming from the discovery defalcations.still,the district court expressly declined to dismiss the case and instead ordered pmc to produce its rule b witnesses by august.the district court deferred ruling on dyncorp motion in limine and made clear that it would consider additional sanctions,including dismissal,if pmc failed to ameliorate the prejudice that its discovery defalcations caused dyncorp 
on august,pmc offered al muhanna and zacharia for deposition.however,pmc also informed dyncorp that al muhanna and zacharia were no longer its rule b witnesses and offered mohammed roof as its new rule b representative.pmc also continued to produce additional relevant documents that it had not previously disclosed,some of which were written in arabic.dyncorp then submitted a supplemental memorandum to the district court,renewing its motion in limine and requesting that the district court strike pmc claim of damages or alternatively,dismiss the case.on august,the district court heard argument on and granted dyncorp motion in limine.the district court noted that t hroughout the pendency of the case,pmc has consistently asserted that the proper measure of pmc damages for the breach of the subcontract is the total amount of money dyncorp paid into the lebanon a ccount.j.and in pursuing that theory of damages,pmc continually refused to comply with dyncorp discovery requests aimed at ascertaining the identity of pmc subcontractors,the subcontracts between pmc and those entities,and whether monies were paid from the lebanon a ccount to pmc subcontractors and employees for work done in connection with the subcontract.the district court concluded that,as a matter of law,pmc bore the burden of proving not only the amount of money received from dyncorp through the lebanon account,but also the costs avoided by the fact that some of pmc subcontractors and employees were paid out of the lebanon account,relieving pmc of the obligation to pay those debts.the district court thus held that pmc measure of damages was improper and contrary to law and ordered pmc claim for damages to be excluded from trial 
the district court also reconsidered sanctions against pmc and found that the prior remedies it had ordered fell far short of remedying the prejudice to dyncorp caused by pmc continuing discovery defalcations.the district court detailed the extent of pmc abusive behavior in this case pmc did not provide its measure of damages until after the close of discovery pmc refused to account for costs avoided in its measure of damages,as required by law pmc withheld documents showing that funds were paid from the lebanon account to pmc subcontractors and pmc withheld documents showing that pmc ownership had contemporaneous knowledge of those payments.specifically,the district court found that pmc improperly withheld a number of documents showing that al muhanna contemporaneously knew that funds from the lebanon account were being used to satisfy pmc obligations.the district court then found that these documents directly contradicted al muhanna deposition testimony that pmc had ceased payments to its subcontractors and employees once dyncorp began making payments to the lebanon account.the district court also concluded that pmc gave a false answer to an interrogatory when it was asked to i dentify all funds received by pmc from the lebanon a ccount,as well as all payments from the lebanon a ccount to satisfy obligations of pmc.pmc answered that it has not received funds from fawaz lebanon a ccount,and it is not aware of the extent,if any,to which payments were made from fawaz personal account in lebanon to satisfy obligations of pmc.the district court found that it was clear that pmc knew that some funds had been paid from the lebanon a ccount to pmc subcontractors.
the district court also noted that pmc rule b witnesses refused to be deposed before august as ordered and were not available for deposition until august,two days before the trial date.it noted that pmc sent a series of emails on august,producing a number of documents contained in separate pdf and excel attachments for the august depositions,which were scheduled to begin at the next morning.on the morning of the,pmc delivered two boxes of documents to dyncorp,including documents that had not yet been produced and new documents that were written in arabic.pmc also took the position that neither al muhanna nor zacharia was appearing as a rule b deponent and named an entirely new rule b witness.and when dyncorp took the new depositions of al muhanna and zacharia,both witnesses gave evasive and unresponsive answers to the questions propounded.
the district court again evaluated pmc conduct under the standard in schaffer equipment,invoking its inherent authority to impose sanctions up to,and including,the most extreme sanction,the dismissal without deciding the merits.quoting schaffer,at.the district court concluded that pmc was highly culpable in its discovery defalcations and that dyncorp was significantly prejudiced by pmc actions.the district court further concluded that its prior sanctions did not remedy the prejudice to dyncorp.because no further actions on pmc part could remedy the harm to dyncorp,the district court concluded that involuntary dismissal was warranted.the district court dismissed pmc case with prejudice and entered its final judgment on september.

pmc principally argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a sanction of dismissal of its case against dyncorp we have previously recognized that,d ue to the very nature of the court as an institution,it must and does have an inherent power to impose order,respect,decorum,silence,and compliance with lawful mandates.shaffer,at.a court inherent power includes the ability to order the dismissal of a case,though such orders must be entered with the greatest caution.id.at.orders of dismissal are appropriate when a party deceives a court or abuses the process at a level that is utterly inconsistent with the orderly administration of justice or undermines the integrity of the process.id.
before exercising its inherent power to dismiss a case based on the wrongdoing of a party in the judicial process,
a court must consider the following factors the degree of the wrongdoer culpability the extent of the client blameworthiness if the wrongful conduct is committed by its attorney,recognizing that we seldom dismiss claims against blameless clients the prejudice to the judicial process and the administration of justice the prejudice to the victim the availability of other sanctions to rectif
