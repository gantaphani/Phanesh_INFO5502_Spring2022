in the first of these two related appeals,mark jenkins contests the summary judgment awarded methodist hospitals of dallas,and affiliated individuals collectively,hospital against his claim under providing equal contract rights for all persons under the law.among other things,at issue is whether jenkins,who is black,failed to establish,sufficient to defeat summary judgment,that intentional discrimination on the basis of race interfered with his ability to make or enforce contracts.at issue in the other appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing,sua sponte,under federal rule of civil procedure,sanctions against jenkins attorney for a misrepresentation in his brief.judgment and sanctions affirmed.
jenkins,a cardiologist,joined north texas cardiovascular associates ntca in,after completing a cardiology fellowship.ntca in turn had a contractual relationship with the methodist hospitals of dallas to provide cardiac services to patients.accordingly,shortly after joining ntca,jenkins applied for privileges at the hospital.
jack barnett,then chief of the hospital department of medicine,initially opposed the application,purportedly due to jenkins omission of an unsatisfactory item in his history.when barnett opposition failed to persuade his colleagues,however,he gave jenkins application his support.upon being granted staff privileges at the hospital in late,jenkins began working in the cardiac catheterization laboratory cath lab,where he performed,inter alia,primary angioplasty.
the administrative director of the cardiology department testified by deposition that,starting approximately six months after jenkins arrived,employees communicated to her they felt they were working in a hostile environment.as a result,in,she requested a meeting with the staff,a vice president,and the administrator for cardiology.following that meeting on july,the cardiology administrator met with robert edmonson,then director of cardiology,and barnett,among others and formed an ad hoc committee to determine whether he should be subject to corrective action.
that committee interviewed a number of staff members,members,hospital administrators,and jenkins.as stated in a committee document,the committee concluded there was a hostile environment in the cath lab,which is potentially injurious to patient care,due in large part to jenkins and,on july,recommended termination of his membership and privileges.
the committee recommendation was forwarded to the corporate medical board board.on july,after meeting that day with jenkins,the board summarily suspended jenkins privileges,pending further review.
on july,after further review of the evidence related to jenkins conduct,however,the board recommended that jenkins retain his staff membership and privileges under certain conditions,such as his acknowledging he created a hostile environment in the cath lab and apologizing both in writing and in person to the employees,agreeing to undergo psychiatric evaluation and ongoing counseling from a psychiatrist selected by the board,and agreeing to the monitoring of his behavior for an indefinite period of time by a committee recommended by the board.jenkins agreed to all of the conditions,except evaluation by a psychiatrist he requested choosing his own.
accordingly,on august,jenkins requested further review by a committee of the medical staff.and,on september,the summary suspension was reported to the national practitioner data bank npdb.
following a hearing in december and january,the committee unanimously disagreed with jenkins summary suspension and,on february,recommended petitioning the npdb to void the adverse recommendation.upon receipt of the committee report,the board made a final recommendation on february to reinstate jenkins privileges,to establish a monitoring committee,and to petition the npdb to void the adverse recommendation.in sum,jenkins suspension lasted approximately seven months.
in this action,jenkins presented numerous federal and claims against the hospital.only one is on appeal under,for racial discrimination impairing his ability to make or enforce contracts.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the hospital.for the claim at issue,the court held there was no contract in the record to form the basis of a claim and,even if there were,jenkins failed to create a genuine issue of material fact on whether the hospital had the intent to discriminate against him on the basis of race.jenkins methodist hosps.of dallas,wl.

the and sanctions issues are addressed in turn.for the former,jenkins failed to show a material fact issue concerning claimed racial discrimination.for the latter,the district court did not abuse its considerable discretion.

to defeat summary judgment,jenkins was required,inter alia,to show a genuine issue of material fact.the following concern the underlying process for determining whether he made that showing.
first,jenkins had to establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination.bellows amoco oil,cir.he had to show he is a member of a racial minority the hospital had the intent to discriminate against him on the basis of race and the discrimination concerned the making or enforcement of a contract.id.upon jenkins making this showing,the hospital was required to articulate a legitimate,reason for the summary suspension,rachid jack in the box,cir.the burden then shifted to jenkins to show either the proffered reason was not true,but rather a pretext for discrimination or the reason,although true,was only one reason for the suspension,and jenkins race was another motivating factor.id.to meet the prong,jenkins had to show his race actually played a role in the hospital process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.reeves sanderson plumbing,d quoting hazen paper biggins,d.throughout the burden shifting,jenkins had the ultimate burden of showing a genuine issue of material fact on whether the hospital intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of race.see id.at.
jenkins claims by summarily suspending his privileges for seven months and reporting this action to the npdb,the hospital intentionally discriminated against him and thereby interfered with the making or enforcement of his contracts with the ntca,patients needing angioplasty,and a different hospital at which he wanted to acquire staff privileges.because jenkins contends the suspension of his privileges and report to the npdb interfered with his ability to make and enforce contracts,we first examine whether those actions were racially discriminatory.if they were not,we need not determine whether each defendant separately engaged in racially discriminatory conduct.the hospital responds that the alleged contracts can not form the basis for a claim.in the alternative,it contends the suspension was due,not to racial animus,but to concern that jenkins was creating a hostile environment in the cath lab which could potentially result in a lower standard of patient care and it was legally required to report the action to the npdb.
