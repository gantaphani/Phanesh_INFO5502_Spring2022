the district court granted peter prostyakov petition to confirm his arbitral award against masco corporation and,in so doing,denied masco application to vacate the award on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his authority when fashioning it.see a.masco appeals,arguing that the district court erred by confirming the award.prostyakov,in turn,asserts that masco appeal is frivolous,and asks us to sanction masco by ordering it to pay for his attorneys fees and costs.we affirm the district court judgment,but deny prostyakov motion.
the origins of this arbitration action can be traced back sixteen years to the dissolution of the soviet union.shortly after the soviet empire fell in late,the state of indiana and the moscow oblast province a trade consortium that coordinated american businesses efforts to establish a market presence in the newly capitalistic russian economy.masco,a corporation that specializes in building,plumbing,and cabinetry products,joined the consortium in with the aspiration of developing a sales and distribution network throughout the nascent russian federation.one of the men that masco hired to achieve this goal was prostyakov,who,all parties agree,played a central role in developing the company russian presence.in december,masco rewarded prostyakov for his efforts by appointing him managing director and agent of its office.
for a while masco and prostyakov business relationship went swimmingly,but then things quickly went south.as often is the case in these situations,both masco and prostyakov blamed each other for their deteriorating relationship.the parties respective accusations are not important for the purpose of this appeal,but what is important is that on april,masco president and ceo richard manoogian issued a company directive addressed to the appropriate officials of the russian republic,stating that prostyakov was removed from his position with masco.although prostyakov never received the any other written confirmation of his removal from his position with and masco began to negotiate the end of their business relationship these negotiations culminated with the parties entering into a settlement agreement on june.as relevant here,masco and prostyakov mutually agreed to release all claims that either party could bring against the other based on acts that occurred before the agreement took effect.masco and prostyakov further agreed that indiana law would govern the interpretation of the agreement any future disputes between them would be settled by private arbitration the rules of the american arbitration association aaa would apply and govern the conduct of the arbitration and neither party would seek to enforce the agreement through legal action.
moreover,the parties agreed that the end of their business relationship was amicable,and would be communicated to interested third parties as such.as part of the amicable separation,masco agreed to announce publicly that it and prostyakov had been working for the past couple of months to disengage from their previous business relationship because prostyakov decided to seek other business opportunities for himself that disengagement,the announcement stated,was finally accomplished on june.masco and prostyakov then went their own ways.
his separation from masco complete,prostyakov sought an executive position with the federal industrial bank in moscow.prostyakov overtures were successful,and he entered into an employment contract to join the bank as deputy chairman of the board of directors on july.prostyakov was required under the contract to submit by his start date all documents necessary to formalize his employment under the russian labor code,including his labor book.as we will see,prostyakov encountered some problems with his labor book that are central to this appeal.but before we recount those problems we must first explain the russian labor book.
for those not familiar with russian labor law,the labor book is a creation of the labor code that survived the collapse of the soviet union.see butler,soviet law ed amy bliss,comment,proletariat to perestroika a comparison of labor law in the soviet union and the russian federation,comp.lab,john knab,complying with russia labor code,bus.info.service for newly indep.states.htm.the labor book purpose,though arguably antiquated,is quite simple it is a russian citizen record of his employment history.see butler,supra,at bliss,supra,at knab,supra.every russian citizen entering the workforce is issued a labor book,which the citizen must submit to his employer once his employment begins.see butler,supra,at bliss,supra,at knab,supra.the employer retains the labor book throughout the period of employment and records in it the employee work experience.see butler,supra,at knab,supra.if the employee is dismissed,the employer must,at the time of dismissal,record in the labor book the specific reason for dismissal by citing the provision of the labor code under which the dismissal was carried out if the employment relationship was terminated by mutual agreement,the employer likewise must state so.see butler,supra,at knab,supra.the employer must then immediately return the labor book to the employee.butler,supra,at knab,supra.
prostyakov submitted his labor book to masco when the company hired him,and masco retained the labor book throughout the period of his employment.but masco did not immediately return prostyakov labor book to him once his employment ended.in fact,after the parties entered into the settlement agreement on june,masco ignored prostyakov repeated requests for his labor book.masco stonewalling,in turn,made it impossible for prostyakov to submit his labor book to the federal industrial bank by his first day,which forced him to renegotiate his start date so he could have additional time to recover the labor book.
prostyakov finally recovered his labor book in late august it was then that he saw,for the first time,masco entry regarding his employment history with the company.simply put,masco wrote that on april,prostyakov was fired,or,as the entry put it exactly,d ismissed by the decree of the directors council of masco corporation usa from moscow representation of masco corporation usa.although prostyakov knew the entry was incorrect,he immediately delivered the labor book to the federal industrial bank to fulfill his obligation under the employment contract.the next day,though,the bank returned prostyakov labor book to him along with a letter terminating their employment contract in the letter the bank stated that it could not hire a new employee for a supervisory position if this potential employee had been fired by a corporate management from the place of his latest employment because of unclear reasons.
shortly after the federal industrial bank cancelled the employment contract,prostyakov former at masco,inna kalinina,informed him that masco labor book entry had been intentionally falsified.specifically,kalinina stated that,immediately before masco was to return the labor book to prostyakov in august,prostyakov successor at the company ordered her to backdate an entry stating that prostyakov had been fired on april,contradicting the settlement agreement provision that prostyakov left under amicable circumstances.prostyakov accordingly asked masco to correct the labor book entry,but when his requests fell on deaf ears he asked masco to resolve the dispute through arbitration.masco,however,simply ignored prostyakov arbitration requests,a fact that masco general counsel would later readily admit 
seeing no other course of redress,prostyakov turned to the russian judicial system in january.he filed a complaint in the noginsk city court,alleging that masco violated the russian labor code with its backdated and falsified labor book entry.after years of navigating the russian legal system,prostyakov finally obtained a default judgment against masco in march,declaring that masco did,indeed,violate the labor code with its labor book entry.
armed with the russian court judgment,in february prostyakov filed with the aaa a demand for arbitration.prostyakov claimed that masco breached the settlement agreement by authoring the fraudulent labor book entry.he therefore requested an award of both monetary damages stemming from the loss of his employment with the federal industrial bank,and equitable relief in the form of an executive order from manoogian,correcting the labor book entry.
masco responded to prostyakov demand for arbitration by arguing that the aaa lacked jurisdiction over the,in this context,meant that the parties did not agree to have the aaa arbitrate the claims.instead,masco asserted,the settlement agreement stipulated only that arbitration would be conducted privately,meaning without aaa assistance.masco objections to aaa participation greatly prolonged the process,and it was over a year before the parties could agree on an attorney max hittle.although masco informed prostyakov that arbitrator hittle would be an acceptable arbitrator,it continued to assert that his involvement was improper because of his affiliation with the aaa.masco accordingly moved to dismiss prostyakov claims on the basis that hittle was not authorized to serve as arbitrator.hittle denied masco motion,concluding that he had authority because masco and prostyakov had selected him by following the procedures set forth in the agreement,and had submitted to aaa involvement by stating in the agreement that aaa rules would govern the arbitration proceedings.
despite continuing to object to arbitrator hittle authority to oversee the dispute,masco became an active participant in the arbitration.specifically,masco counterclaimed on the ground that prostyakov breached the settlement agreement by initiating the russian legal action instead of seeking arbitration.masco also filed a second motion to dismiss,this time arguing that prostyakov claim involving the labor book was nonarbitrable because it fell outside the scope of the agreement.hittle rejected that argument and denied masco motion,but allowed the company to proceed on its counterclaim.
the arbitration hearing occurred over a period in,during which both masco and prostyakov presented testimony and evidence supporting their positions.significantly,both parties presented experts on the russian labor code to testify about the legality of the termination of masco and prostyakov business relationship.prostyakov expert testified that the directive issued by manoogian on april,which purported to fire prostyakov was,under the labor code,an ineffective method of dismissing prostyakov from his position because the directive never was delivered to him.moreover,both masco and prostyakov legal experts agreed that masco labor book entry violated the labor code because it was backdated,incorrectly stated that prostyakov was fired,and did not cite the specific labor code provision for termination of employment by mutual agreement.both experts further agreed that masco corporate board could correct the entry by issuing a new executive order,nullifying both the incorrect entry and manoogian april directive.
on august,arbitrator hittle issued a thorough decision detailing his awards for both masco and prostyakov.hittle first decided for masco on its counterclaim,determining that,under indiana law,prostyakov breached the settlement agreement by bringing the russian legal action instead of initiating arbitration.hittle accordingly awarded masco approximately for the attorneys fees and costs it incurred defending that action.
arbitrator hittle also decided,however,that masco breached the settlement agreement by not immediately returning prostyakov labor book to him,and by authoring the harmful,retaliatory in nature,and incorrectly dated labor book entry.because masco breach cost prostyakov his employment with the federal industrial bank in moscow,and because the labor book itself was a creation of the russian labor code,hittle determined that indiana provisions required him to apply the russian labor code to fashion an award for masco breach as hittle explained,the labor code was the law of the forum with the most intimate contacts governing the dispute.applying the labor code to determine the parties rights and obligations,hittle concluded that masco owed prostyakov approximately in damages,attorneys fees,and costs.hittle also relied on the testimony of the russian labor law experts and ordered manoogian to annul the directive he issued on april,and correct masco labor book entry by issuing a new executive order that order was to state that the board of directors of masco hereby acknowledge and agree that peter alexandrovich prostyakov is discharged as managing director and agent of masco corporation in the russian federation this day of august,pursuant to the mutual agreement of peter prostyakov and masco corporation.
prostyakov then petitioned the district court to confirm arbitrator hittle award.masco,in turn,filed a timely motion to vacate the award,see webster kearney,cir,arguing,as relevant here,that hittle exceeded his powers as arbitrator when fashioning it,see a.specifically,masco reasserted both its challenge to hittle authority to serve as arbitrator because of his affiliation with the aaa,and its argument that the labor book dispute fell outside the scope of the settlement agreement.masco also contended that hittle fashioned an improper award by ignoring the agreement provision when applying the russian labor code and forcing masco to rewrite history by ordering it to state in the executive order that prostyakov left masco on august.
the district court rejected masco arguments,agreeing first with arbitrator hittle determination that he had authority over the dispute because he was selected by masco and prostyakov according to the procedure outlined in the settlement agreement.the court further agreed that the labor book dispute was arbitrable because the agreement was intended to resolve all loose ends regarding the failed employment relationship between the parties,and that the labor book issue certainly was such a loose end.finally,the court determined that the award itself was proper.hittle,the court stated,attempted to apply indiana provisions accurately when fashioning the award,and thus did not exceed his authority by applying an unusual amalgam of indiana and russian law.moreover,the court added,hittle award of the corrective executive order was well within the bounds of what the arbitrator may permissibly require in equity.the court accordingly denied masco motion,granted prostyakov petition,and confirmed the arbitral award.
ii.analysis 
masco attacks the district court confirmation of prostyakov arbitral award on the grounds that the court incorrectly determined that arbitrator hittle acted within his powers when fashioning it.see a.in so doing,masco merely reasserts the three arguments it raised before the district court,specifically that hittle lacked the proper authority to serve as arbitrator because the settlement agreement precluded the involvement of arbitrators the labor book dispute was not arbitrable because it fell outside the scope of the agreement and hittle fashioned improper monetary and equitable awards.prostyakov responds that each of masco arguments not only are frivolous but also are raised in bad faith,and accordingly asks us to sanction masco.we accept the district court findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous and review questions of law de novo.slaney int l amateur ath.fed n,cir.
