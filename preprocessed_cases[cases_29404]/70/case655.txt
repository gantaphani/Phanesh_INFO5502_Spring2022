the practice of law can be abundantly rewarding,but also stressful.the absence of civility displayed by some practitioners heightens stress and debases the legal profession.those attorneys who allow their personal animosity for an opposing counsel or an opposing party to infect a case damage their reputations and blemish the dignity of the profession they have taken an oath to uphold.
in green gte california,th,we said counsel comments and actions at a deposition made the term civil procedure an oxymoron.in comparison to what occurred in this case,one could almost say the offending counsel in green conducted himself with decorum.
here the practice of law became more than stressful it was dangerous.an attorney representing himself threatened defendants counsel with pepper spray and a stun gun at a deposition.when defendants moved for terminating sanctions,plaintiff filed an opposition that was openly contemptuous of the trial court.such conduct can have consequences.see in re koven th.the trial court granted defendants motion for terminating sanctions.plaintiff appeals the ensuing judgment.we affirm.
in his first amended complaint,douglas crawford crawford alleged causes of action for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,negligence and elder abuse,as follows 
on september,crawford accompanied his mother,ninion crawford ninion to a branch of jpmorgan chase bank,chase to withdraw money from ninion account.while there,ninion instructed chase to place a note on her bank accounts not to withdraw or transfer more than without first contacting crawford.a chase employee agreed to comply.
in april,shruti kohli was employed by chase as an investment advisor.kohli advised ninion to invest in a year annuity.ninion was years old at the time.kohli prepared a slip to withdraw from ninion account.the money was transferred without first contacting crawford.
ninion is now deceased.her estate has assigned the causes of action alleged in the complaint to crawford.crawford named chase,kohli and the chase branch president,melissa griffin,as defendants chase rescinded the annuity,but crawford complains that chase failed to reimburse him in lost interest.
small claims actions 
crawford served notices of depositions and deposition subpoenas for the three defendants and chase counsel.the depositions were noticed to take place at crawford personal residence.
chase objected to holding the depositions at crawford private residence because the deponents and their counsel feared for their safety.crawford had filed an appeal in another case he had brought against chase in san diego.in the instant case,chase attached crawford petition for rehearing in the san diego case as an exhibit to support its objection to holding the deposition at crawford residence.
crawford petition referenced the oklahoma city and boston bombings.the petition stated in part the more simple truism or reality of life is that the victims of government abuse,bias or even unequal application of the law do not,actually,detonate a bomb in retaliation to those abuses,but,generally,go home and kick the dog to death for barking or beat the crap out of some random person for cutting them off in traffic or shoot up the workplace for getting passed over for a promotion or burn their children with scalding hot water for spilling a glass of milk,or,in other words,translate their frustrations of helplessness into committing a heinous act in apparent disproportion to the harm that befell upon them.the ripple effect of injustices committed by government agents like the justices who ruled against him herein,just roll downhill onto and into the lives of other truly innocent,unconnected individuals and makes this just a crappier place to live.
the deponents did not appear for their depositions.instead of filing a discovery motion in the underlying case,crawford filed individual small claims court actions against each of the chase defendants and chase counsel.the actions were based on the deponents failure to appear in response to deposition subpoenas.crawford requested damages,including,and actual damages for failure to obey a subpoena as provided by code of civil procedure section 
chase moved ex parte to quash the small claims court actions.the trial court denied the motion to quash,but ordered the cases transferred and consolidated with the instant action.
deposition of matthew crawford 
matthew crawford matthew is crawford brother.matthew was the sole beneficiary of the annuity.chase contended crawford true objection to the annuity was not that it was unsuitable for his mother,but that his mother excluded him.thus chase believed that matthew was a material witness.
chase served a deposition subpoena and a notice of deposition for matthew in san francisco where he resided.the subpoena did not state that the deposition would be videotaped,but the notice did.
on february,matthew appeared for his deposition with crawford as his attorney.matthew and crawford walked out claiming they were afraid for their personal safety.
the question of matthew deposition was raised at a february,hearing.the trial judge suggested that chase use the judge name to request a conference room at the san francisco superior court for the deposition.that should alleviate any concern that crawford might have for his personal safety.
chase emailed crawford on march,stating that it could not obtain the use of a superior court conference room.chase said it was willing to take matthew deposition at a court reporter office of crawford selection.chase proposed march,as the deposition date.
crawford replied that he would not respond to the deposition request until chase responded to his request for a camera in the courtroom for trial and a continuance of the trial date.
on march,chase emailed crawford asking whether matthew would appear for the march deposition.crawford replied that discovery closed two weeks prior.in reply,chase pointed out that matthew had been served with a deposition subpoena,appeared for the deposition,but left immediately after being sworn.chase asked again if matthew would appear for his deposition on march.crawford did not reply.on march,chase appeared for matthew deposition,but neither matthew nor crawford appeared.
on april,the court held a hearing on crawford motion for relief from a jury waiver.crawford inquired of the court what the sanction would be if matthew did not appear for his deposition.the court refused to commit to any particular sanction.at the hearing,crawford did not mention the close of discovery issue.in fact,crawford wanted to reopen discovery to depose one of chase witnesses.
chase agreed to the deposition of its witness and suggested several dates for matthew deposition.crawford suggested april,but stated matthew deposition would not be videotaped absent a court order.
after further emails,chase moved to compel matthew deposition.chase counsel stated there was good reason for videotaping because crawford had falsely accused him of irrational,intimidating or violent behavior.chase pointed out that section allows a party to give notice of its intention to videotape at least three days prior to the deposition.
the trial court ruled that crawford
