appellant the cadle company cadle appeals the bankruptcy court denial of its motion for sanctions against richard schiro schiro,counsel for the debtor in the underlying chapter bankruptcy proceeding.cadle also appeals the bankruptcy court award of attorney fees to schiro.as cadle failed to comply with the service requirement of rule,we affirm the denial of sanctions.we do not have jurisdiction to review the award of attorney fees,however,because,on appeal,the district court remanded that issue to the bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings.
facts and proceedings 
this motion for sanctions and subsequent award of attorney fees is the result of a longstanding fight between cadle and the pratt family.the history of this case is long and convoluted,but a short recitation of the facts will suffice to resolve the current issues on appeal.
on august,jack pratt,pratt filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.schiro represented pratt in the bankruptcy proceeding.several months later,cadle,one of pratt creditors,filed an adversary action against him,objecting to his bankruptcy discharge.cadle argued that the discharge should be denied because,among other things,pratt never disclosed his right to payments under his mother will.at trial,schiro presented testimony that pratt was not entitled to any distributions from his mother estate because he owed more for loans made to him by his mother during her lifetime than any distributions to which he would have been entitled under the will.the bankruptcy court determined that cadle had failed to meet its burden of showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that pratt debts should be nondischargeable 
after the bankruptcy court rendered a decision in the pratt action,cadle learned that pratt had received loans from his mother estate after her death.cadle filed a motion for rule sanctions against schiro in the bankruptcy court where the pratt adversary proceeding was tried the bankruptcy court denied cadle motion for sanctions for failure to serve schiro with a copy of the motion days prior to filing with the court.alternatively,the bankruptcy court noted that cadle was unable to establish a rule violation because the original testimony regarding pratt distributions from the will was both credible and persuasive.pursuant to rule,the bankruptcy court awarded schiro attorney fees for defending the motion for sanctions.
on appeal,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court denial of sanctions based on cadle failure to comply with the service requirement of rule.alternatively,the district court determined that cadle motion for sanctions was untimely,as it was filed after the conclusion of the case.in a footnote to the opinion,the district court observed that cadle had also failed to prove a rule violation.the district court held,however,that the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion by awarding attorney fees and expenses to schiro without allowing cadle the right to examine,question,or provide argument against the claimed fees and expenses.the district court remanded the award of attorney fees to the bankruptcy court for a determination of whether the award is warranted and,if so,whether the amounts requested by schiro for attorney fees and expenses are reasonable and necessary.cadle appeals the bankruptcy court denial of its motion for rule sanctions,and the bankruptcy court award of attorney fees in favor of schiro.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we apply the same standard of review to the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law as applied by the district court the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo as the imposition of sanctions is a matter of discretion for the bankruptcy court,we review under an abuse of discretion standard.if we were to reach the bankruptcy court award of attorney fees,we would review it for abuse of discretion 
jurisdiction 
we must first address the question of appellate jurisdiction.although neither party raised the issue on appeal,we are required to examine the basis for our jurisdiction,sua sponte,if necessary.
under d,we have jurisdiction to hear appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees.we have held that w hen a district court sitting as a court of appeals in bankruptcy remands a case to the bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings,the remand order is not final and therefore not appealable under d.here,the district court remanded the issue of attorney fees to the bankruptcy court.we must therefore determine whether such a remand requires significant further proceedings.
to determine what constitutes significant further proceedings,we distinguish between those remands requiring the bankruptcy court to perform judicial functions and those requiring mere ministerial functions.if the remand requires the bankruptcy court to perform judicial functions,such as additional,it is not a final order and therefore it is not appealable to this court remands that involve only ministerial proceedings,such as the entry of an order by the bankruptcy court in accordance with the district court decision,are considered final in some instances,a remand for the calculation of attorney fees may be considered a ministerial function however,a remand requiring such a calculation is not final if it necessitates further factual development or other significant judicial activity involving the exercise of considerable discretion,or is likely to generate a new appeal or affect the issue that the disappointed party wants to raise on appeal from the order of remand.
in the instant case,the district court remanded the bankruptcy court order to determine whether the award of attorney fees is warranted and,if so,whether the amounts requested by schiro for attorney fees and expenses are reasonable and necessary.such an order requires schiro to submit additional evidence regarding his fees and allows cadle the right to examine,question,or otherwise argue against the claimed fees and expenses.cadle may also choose to appeal the bankruptcy court decision on remand.as the remand order requires the bankruptcy court to perform judicial functions,we do not have jurisdiction to review the award of attorney fees.
although we do not have jurisdiction to review the award of attorney fees,the district court did not remand but affirmed the denial of sanctions,which was the substantive issue on appeal.so,the question remains whether,under d,the district court remand of the attorney fees issue prevents finality of the principal issue,affirming the order denying sanctions.
the supreme court has made clear that a decision on the merits is a final decision for purposes of whether or not there remains for adjudication a request for attorney fees attributable to the case.the court has not addressed finality under d,but we have indicated that the same rule applies equally to cases appealed under that section additionally,both the first and tenth circuits have held that appellate jurisdiction is proper under d,even though the collateral issue of attorney fees has been remanded to the bankruptcy court 
we are convinced that irrespective of the remand of the issue of attorney fees,the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court denial of sanctions is a final judgment on the merits appealable under d.the remand order in this case concerns only the collateral issue of attorney fees the bankruptcy court decision on remand will not affect the district court order affirming the denial of sanctions.such a question remaining to be decided after an order ending litigation on the merits does not prevent finality if its resolution will not alter the order or moot or revise decisions embodied in the order.
having determined that the district court remand of the award of attorney fees does not deprive us of jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court denial of sanctions,we turn now to the merits of that ruling.rule c a of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure states that a motion for sanctions may not be filed with or presented to the court unless,withi
