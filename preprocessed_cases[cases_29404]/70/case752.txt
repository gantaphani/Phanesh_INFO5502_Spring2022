appellant gil mileikowsky,appeals from an order which granted a request for terminating sanctions,and a request for in monetary sanctions.the order was based on his repeated failure to provide discovery.for the reasons set forth herein,the court order is affirmed.
although an order granting a request for terminating sanctions is not appealable and the losing party should ordinarily await entry of the order of dismissal to file notice of appeal,we denied a motion to dismiss the appeal on grounds of prematurity because an order granting monetary sanctions in amounts over is immediately appealable,subd.as is explained further below,although we attempted to limit our review to issues pertaining to the monetary sanctions awarded,our reasoning necessarily encompasses the propriety of granting terminating sanctions.we presume,therefore,that after the remittitur issues,an order striking the operative complaint and dismissing the action will be entered.
factual and procedural background 
facts related to substantive.original complaint and preliminary injunction 
mileikowsky brought suit against tenet healthsystem and regional medical in case no.in april.the petition for writ of mandate alleged that mileikowsky had medical and surgical privileges at etrmc since his appointment to membership on the medical staff in.every two years thereafter until,he was reappointed to membership.at that time,he claimed,he was not given actual notice of the approaching expiration date of his term,and was not timely furnished with the materials needed to obtain reappointment essentially a written application in violation of medical staff bylaws.in february,mileikowsky received notice that,as he had not timely filed his application for reappointment,he was considered to have voluntarily resigned.he attempted to file a reappointment application,but was rebuffed.mileikowsky challenged the decision to deem him a voluntary departee,and etrmc medical executive committee allegedly rejected that challenge without prior notice or hearing and in violation of his right to due process.
the petition sought a determination that etrmc actions were invalid and a denial of mileikowsky due process rights,and an order directing etrmc to set aside its actions or restraining it from giving effect to its determination that mileikowsky had voluntarily resigned.
on the day the complaint was filed,the court set a hearing on an order to show cause re preliminary injunction,which it granted on april.the injunction precluded etrmc from preventing mileikowsky from exercising the privileges of an active status physician and surgeon and treating patients,or reporting to others that he had voluntarily resigned.
amended petition 
in june,mileikowsky filed an amended petition that added two tenet entities and individual defendants the amended petition also added tort claims under business and professions code section,and for interference with prospective economic advantage and defamation.
on june,the parties stipulated that the preliminary injunction was to remain in effect pending determination of damage claims,and that mileikowsky does not need mandamus relief as long as the preliminary injunction remains in effect.thereafter,the court took the petition for writ of mandate off calendar,and transferred the matter to a trial department.
new complaint and temporary restraining order 
in january,while the litigation in case no.was ongoing,etrmc executive committee recommended that mileikowsky not be reappointed to its medical staff.
in july,mileikowsky,represented by new counsel,filed a new complaint case no.for breach of contract,breach of covenant of good faith,infliction of emotional distress,retaliation for whistleblowing,and defamation the primary basis of this complaint was that tenet and etrmc had violated the april preliminary injunction by placing restrictions on his access to etrmc facilities,including having him constantly accompanied by security personnel when on etrmc premises.mileikowsky also claimed he was retaliated against for reporting alleged violations of medical standards to the california medical association and for assisting a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action against etrmc.
in a letter attached to the complaint as an exhibit,dale surowitz,etrmc chief executive officer,stated to mileikowsky as a condition to your continued access to hospital facilities and use of hospital resources,you are directed to inform my office or the nurse supervisor in charge outside normal business hours whenever you enter hospital premises.you are also directed to inform my office,in advance,of any surgical procedure,which you schedule at this facility.hospital administration will then assure that security personnel accompany you whenever you are on hospital premises.the letter went on to say a ny failure by you to comply with the measures described above,or any further violation of hospital policies including,but not limited to,perceived threats or intimidation of hospital personnel or medical staff members,and copying of patient records,will result in the summary suspension of your medical staff membership and privileges.
when he filed the new complaint,mileikowsky sought a temporary restraining order tro and order to show cause re preliminary injunction.the opposition justified etrmc action by relating an incident that occurred in december.the operating room manager,marleen hafer,entered a surgical suite where mileikowsky was operating on a patient,and informed him that his surgical assistant did not have clinical privileges and should be immediately replaced by an alternate.mileikowsky aggressively backed hafer,who is less than five feet tall,against a wall while screaming at her,lunging in her direction with his finger and making a head butting motion toward her.the anesthesiologist,fear ing for hafer physical safety,interjected himself and caused mileikowsky to turn away.another observer from outside the room gathered male personnel in case they were needed to restrain mileikowsky.the opposition further claimed that mileikowsky has been involved in a longstanding series of incidents in which he has threatened,verbally attacked and even physically assaulted hospital employees and other members of the medical staff.the only specific incidence of physical assault described involved grabbing someone name badge while screaming and acting in an uncontrolled and dangerous manner that occurred in february.there was also a reference to a incident where mileikowsky screamed at someone over the phone and threatened to become an israeli warrior and go to war.
the court issued a tro dated july,prohibiting etrmc from requiring mileikowsky to be escorted while with or in view of any patient.
in august,mileikowsky filed an application for contempt and sanctions against etrmc for violation of the july tro.mileikowsky contended that security personnel sent to follow him were seen by patients and family members.in addition,a handwritten memorandum was posted on an etrmc bulletin board,stating when mileikowsky is here,he is to be escorted by security at all times.the application was denied.
in september,defendants sought to modify the july tro due to mileikowsky actions in visiting etrmc to take photographs in support of his application for contempt.the request was denied.subsequently,however,the court did not put in place a preliminary injunction 
in october,mileikowsky filed a first amended complaint in case no,omitting all of the individual defendants save for surowitz,and adding claims for invasion of privacy,false light,and interference with prospective economic advantage based on the same essential facts of having him followed by security,interfering with his treatment of patients.the court found that the case was related to the earlier petition,and deemed the earlier petition the lead case.by order dated january,a motion to consolidate was granted.in april,however,the court issued an order stating that the cases were henceforth unconsolidated.
in november,etrmc summarily suspended mileikowsky clinical privileges.
in april,mileikowsky filed a second amended complaint in case no.mileikowsky continued to insist that tenet,etrmc,and surowitz infringed on his rights by interfering with his ability to work at etrmc in retaliation for his actions in reporting misfeasance and supporting a plaintiff in a medical malpractice lawsuit.
in september,mileikowsky filed a third amended complaint in case no,further refining his claims.the parties agreed that he would file a fourth amended complaint to streamline the issues and include the facts contained in case no.so that case could be dismissed.
the fourth amended complaint was filed on february.the defendants were tenet,etrmc,surowitz,fenmore,miller,greenberg,pine,schein,and vermesh the new complaint contained allegations of preferential treatment afforded to certain physicians and referral schemes that amounted to kickbacks uncovered and reported by mileikowsky.the complaint further alleged that defendants had caused mileikowsky to lose privileges at another medical facility.it alleged that mileikowsky had been summarily suspended in november without good reason.it continued to alleged that defendants were acting in retaliation for mileikowsky decision to assist the plaintiff in a malpractice action.
facts related to discovery sanctions 
first motion to compel 
on september,etrmc and individual defendants greenberg,jones,lichtman,miller,morrow,pine,rubenstein,schein,shields,surowitz,treiger,and vermesh each propounded special interrogatories in case no.seeking to flesh out the facts that supported the contentions made in the amended petition that defamatory statements were made by propounding parties,that they engaged in acts intended to drive mileikowsky from his medical practice,destroy his reputation,cause him to be disciplined.the questions asked by each propounding party were virtually identical in substance,inquiring whether mileikowsky contended that the propounding party made defamatory statements or engaged in other actions discussed in the amended complaint.in addition,etrmc sought production of documents.mileikowsky was granted four december,respond to the discovery requests.
on december,the propounding parties filed separate but essentially identical motions to compel responses to the interrogatories and asked for monetary sanctions.in mileikowsky opposition to the motions,his counsel stated in a declaration that he was a busy and that they had severe difficulty in finding the necessary time to prepare responses to all of the simultaneously propounded discovery.counsel anticipate d that prior to the time that this matter is heard,that the discovery responses will have been served.that did not occur,and by order dated january,the court instructed mileikowsky to respond to the interrogatories and document requests by january,and awarded a total of in sanctions.
first request for terminating sanctions second motion to compel 
on january,defendants moved for terminating sanctions or monetary sanctions due to failure to comply with the court order of january.counsel stated in a declaration that he had been advised by mileikowsky counsel that he would comply with the court order two days january that no responses had been received.the opposition again claimed that mileikowsky did not have time to complete the discovery due to his busy practice.counsel stated that responses would be completed before the hearing date on the request for terminating sanctions.
also on january,etrmc moved to compel responses to a second set of special interrogatories and requests for production of documents propounded on december.the interrogatories and requests were directed at learning whether mileikowsky had copied medical records of persons who were not his patients,and mileikowsky had raised objections without responding.mileikowsky opposed the motions,arguing that his objections,one of which was that the questions violated his right against,had been well taken.
by order dated february,the court granted the motions with respect to monetary sanctions and etrmc motions to compel further responses to the interrogatories.mileikowsky was to serve responses on or before february.
second request for terminating sanctions 
on march,etrmc sought terminating sanctions based on failure to comply with the january,order by actually producing documents,although no firm date had been set for that by the court.instead,the parties were to confer with each other through respective counsel and determine a deadline by which mileikowsky would produce documents after receipt of the responses to the request for production.mileikowsky opposition stated that the documents had been delivered on march or march,and blamed the delay on serious health problems within mileikowsky family on march,the court ordered mileikowsky to produce the documents by april and to pay monetary sanctions.
third motion to compel 
on march,etrmc brought a motion to compel based on failure to respond,without objection,to the second set of interrogatories and request for production of documents as required by the order of february.in opposition,mileikowsky contended that etrmc attorney failed to meet and confer and that responses were belatedly to grave family health reasons on march.in his responses,mileikowsky stated that he had not copied any medical records of persons who were not his patients,and that there were no documents responsive to the request.by order dated april,the court ordered mileikowsky to pay monetary sanctions.the order further stated this is the third time that the court has imposed monetary sanctions upon mileikowsky and his counsel for failures to provide discovery in this proceeding.the court believes that such monetary sanctions are not sufficient to obtain compliance by mileikowsky and his counsel with their discovery obligations,and the court believes that the failure to provide discovery in this case has been frivolous and in bad faith.accordingly,mileikowsky and his counsel are warned that any further failures on their part to comply with their discovery obligations in this matter may result in the imposition of an evidence sanction,an issue sanction,or a terminating sanction,in addition to monetary sanctions.
third request for terminating sanctions 
on february,etrmc served a third set of requests for production on mileikowsky seeking mileikowsky curriculum vitae,documents evidencing his board certification in the specialty of infertility,and documents evidencing his board certification between january,and the present.on april,etrmc once again moved for terminating sanctions,this time for failure to respond to the third set of requests for production.in opposition,counsel for mileikowsky claimed to have inadvertently filed the new request with older requests,failing to realize that it was new.the two documents responsive to the request were attached to the opposition.on may,the court ordered mileikowsky to pay monetary sanctions,but refrained from dismissing the action because of the fact that the discovery request in this instance appears to be of trivial importance and appears to be one which could readily have been included in one of the prior discovery requests.the court was therefore not positively certain that this discovery request was not motivated more by the desire to harass mileikowsky than by the need of relevant information.
fourth motion to compel 
on august,etrmc and the individual defendants moved to compel mileikowsky to respond to questions he was asked at his deposition and for monetary sanctions.mileikowsky had refused to translate hebrew language advertisements he had placed in hebrew language newspapers,or to respond to questions concerning behavioral or disciplinary problems experienced during his medical residency and seeking to identify his referral sources.he had also refused to produce his engagement calendars.at the same time,etrmc and the individual defendants sought an order compelling mileikowsky to appear and conclude his deposition.mileikowsky moved for a protective order because defendants insisted on taking his deposition on four days in a row,rather than spread out over the calendar to accommodate mileikowsky schedule.
on september,the parties filed a stipulation setting dates for mileikowsky deposition and specifying that documents would be provided.the court signed the stipulation,and put off the question of appointing a referee.later,a discovery referee was appointed,and the parties stipulated to the appointment of a second one.
fourth request for terminating sanctions 
in february,defendants moved for terminating sanctions due to mileikowsky failure to post referee fees and refusal to attend a scheduled hearing before the discovery referee.mileikowsky stated in his opposition that he had refused to appear before the discovery referee because he erroneously believed he had seen defendants counsel engaged in ex parte contact with the referee.having realized his mistake,he indicated a readiness to proceed.the referee recommended that terminating sanctions be denied and that no monetary sanctions be awarded.the court ruled in accordance with the recommendation.
in march,defendants moved to compel further responses to a request for production of documents propounded by etrmc.there were requests in the set,each asking for documents that pertained to each allegation of the first amended complaint in case no.mileikowsky had objected to them all.
in june,the referee recommended that the august motion to compel further answers at deposition be granted in part and denied in part.he also recommended that a motion to compel production of documents filed by mileikowsky be granted in part and denied in part.the court approved and followed the recommendations.
in may,defendants moved to stay all discovery in the two actions until an ongoing administrative hearing was concluded.
fifth motion to compel 
in july,etrmc moved to compel responses to its third set of interrogatories,its fourth request for production of documents,and its first set of interrogatories and requests for production of documents in case no,and for monetary sanctions.the third set of interrogatories and fourth request for production of documents sought documents and other evidence supporting mileikowsky damage claims.the requests in case no.sought information on contentions contained in the first amended complaint.responses had been submitted to these various discovery requests,but were deemed inadequate by etrmc.on december,counsel informed the court that the parties had entered into stipulations concerning a number of matters,including outstanding discovery disputes.a stipulation and order was signed by counsel for mileikowsky and counsel for respondents on january.in it,mileikowsky agreed to supplement his discovery responses by friday,february.the stipulation and order contained blanks for the signature of the referee and the court,but it was apparently never signed or filed.
fifth request for terminating sanctions 
on february,respondents moved for terminating sanctions on the ground that mileikowsky had violated the stipulation by failing to provide any additional discovery.respondents further sought in sanctions.mileikowsky and his new counsel claimed to have been working diligently on discovery responses,but said they were unable to complete them in time.in addition,counsel was seeking to be relieved.
by report and recommendation dated march,the referee recommended that the motion be granted as to both termination of the litigation and sanctions.the referee stated mileikowsky has demonstrated a pattern of promises and stipulations for the production of discovery responses that are unfulfilled.instead of production,mileikowsky has changed counsel and repeated the pattern of delay and.the referee finds this repetition to be obstructive and willful,and in violation of mileikowsky responsibility to participate in discovery and to comply with stipulations and court orders.sanctions are warranted under ccp a,and.
with respect to the nature of the discovery requests,the referee found that respondents asked for basic information on damage claims and contention interrogatories that are fundamental to respondents ability to prepare a defense.mileikowsky counsel stipulated that production would be complete by february.that stipulation,with the recommendation of the referee,was adopted as an order of the court.nevertheless,the only further production is an incomplete confidentiality log prepared by counsel and produced with mileikowsky opposition to this motion.monetary sanctions in the past have not successfully gained mileikowsky attention.terminating sanctions are appropriate under ccp a.
concerning the separate award of in monetary sanctions,the referee stated t he referee finds that monetary sanctions in the amount of are justified and necessary as an additional sanction against mileikowsky,but not against current counsel.the referee accepts the representation of counsel that substantive responses have been prepared and sent to mileikowsky for review,but not returned by him.the expense of this motion and assembling the record demonstrating justification for terminating sanctions should be recovered by respondent against mileikowsky personally.
on march,respondents requested clarification of the referee report and recommendation.due to the unconsolidation of case nos.and,there had been some confusion about whether both should be subject to terminating sanctions.
at some point either prior to or on april,mileikowsky,acting in pro.asked the referee to reconsider his recommendation.the motion for reconsideration was denied because the statutory requirements of ccp are not met in that the request was not timely and there were no new or different facts.at the hearing on april,in response to the referee comment that it was important on march that your lawyers then representing you told me that they had completed some discovery responses,had sent those responses to you,but you had not returned them,mileikowsky said i do not deny it 
prior to submitting his report and recommendation to the court,the referee clarified that the termination should be as to both of the related cases,noting that mileikowsky was to have filed an amended complaint consolidating the operative pleadings of the two matters.on april,the court adopted the recommendation of the referee concerning sanctions.
mileikowsky retained new counsel,and on may,moved for reconsideration and for relief under code of civil procedure section.the motion pointed out that there was no outstanding court order at the time terminating sanctions were granted,and contended that the parties stipulation did not provide for terminating sanctions as a method of enforcement the motion also presented evidence that prior counsel had not,as represented to the referee,sent prepared responses to mileikowsky for his review and signature at any time prior to the date they were due.in addition,evidence was presented that when other prior counsel sent proposed responses to mileikowsky for review and comment,he responded promptly.
shortly after the motion for reconsideration was filed,respondents moved ex parte to have the referee approve the parties discovery stipulation nunc pro tunc the referee refused the request.the motion for reconsideration was denied on june.
on june,a notice of appeal was filed from the order striking mileikowsky pleadings in this case and terminating sanctions entered on april.the notice said the appeal was to include review of any underlying or intermediate ruling or proceeding,as well as any motion brought to reconsider,or correct,the order,or any motion seeking relief from the order under ccp the notice of appeal was filed under case no,which was said to be related to case no.no separate notice was filed under case no.
motion to dismiss appeal 
on june,respondents moved for an order striking the fourth amended complaint in case no.and the first amended petition for writ of mandate in case no.on july,it was denied without prejudice.
respondents moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that there was no appealable judgment or order.apparently,the reason the trial court refused the motion to strike and refused to enter judgment in favor of respondents was the pendency of the appeal,which generally divests trial court jurisdiction.this court denied the motion to dismiss on the ground that sanction orders in amo
