we have for review a report and recommendation from a referee with regard to the misconduct of gerald john.we have jurisdiction.see art.v.const.as we more fully explain herein,we approve the recommended sanction of disbarment.
in july,pursuant to rule regulating the florida bar f contempt,the florida bar filed a petition for contempt and order to show cause directed to.bar,case no.hereinafter contempt case.this court issued an order to show cause and after responses were filed a referee was appointed.the final hearing in the contempt case was conducted and concluded in february.
before the assigned referee completed the report in connection with the contempt case,he was also appointed as referee in another disciplinary case involving,case no.hereinafter.based on a motion by,and without objection from the bar,it was determined that the designated referee would conduct a hearing in and provide a consolidated report that addressed both cases.in the report from that consolidated proceeding,the referee made the following findings and recommendations.
contempt case.in october,in florida bar,so d,the court suspended for one year.the suspension order was based on demonstration of complete disrespect for the disciplinary process by failing to give notice of his prior suspension to his clients,the courts,and some opposing counsel.the suspension,which began in november,was to continue for a minimum of one year and thereafter until complied with specific terms and conditions established by the court and secured reinstatement.
despite being suspended,continued to occupy his former law office located in boca raton.he maintained his office telephone and fax numbers,and listed his office address and telephone number in the white pages of the telephone book.this contact information remains on his business letterhead.testified that since his suspension he only engages in business for an entity called media international group on the premises of his former law office.however,did not list that business on his office letterhead and it did not appear in the telephone listings 
in june,while was under suspension,he wrote a letter to gary kurtz,an attorney in california.the first sentence of june letter to kurtz stated i am counsel to anglo bio tran and affirmatively stated that he had provided legal opinions about the sufficiency of a complaint filed against anglo bio tran and had discussed the legal course he would advise for his client in the extant or contemplated litigation.kurtz reasonably believed was a florida lawyer acting as or general counsel for anglo bio tran.
based on the letter,as well as testimony presented at the hearing,the referee found guilty of engaging in the practice of law while suspended.he clearly represented himself to be a lawyer.the referee found acted in complete disregard of the court two prior orders suspending him and in contempt of the supreme court of florida 
case no.disciplinary case.in february,while was still a member in good standing of the florida bar,tom bolera,friend and client,contemplated filing a legal malpractice action against his former counsel,john pcolinski,an illinois lawyer.was never admitted to the practice of law in the state of illinois.nevertheless,assisted bolera in filing and amending a civil action against pcolinski in illinois.researched illinois law on the internet further,knowingly allowed bolera to use law office address,telephone number,and fax number as bolera own address for purposes of the illinois civil action.
on february,while was still a member of the florida bar,he wrote a letter to pcolinski and directed the letter to pcolinski law office in illinois.in this letter,written on florida law office letterhead,outlined his client claim against pcolinski and expressed legal opinions about the claim.directed pcolinski to contact his malpractice carrier and to call to discuss the case.
on august,prior to his earlier suspension by this court,wrote a second letter to pcolinski,using his florida law office letterhead.again outlined the basis for his client claim against pcolinski,expressed legal opinions,and asserted accumulated damages.again directed pcolinski to contact his malpractice carrier.pcolinski has been a lawyer since.he is admitted in illinois and arizona.having received the communications from,pcolinski reasonably believed that was serving as counsel to bolera.
thereafter,pcolinski was served with a summons and complaint and then an amended complaint,filed pro se by bolera.pcolinski noted that the address used by bolera was the same as office address.he initiated an investigation into conduct in the case,which revealed that was not admitted to the practice of law in illinois.in january,pcolinski filed a complaint regarding conduct with the florida bar.
the referee took judicial notice of rule regulating the florida bar unlicensed practice of law and the comparable illinois law on the subject illinois rule of professional conduct unauthorized practice of law.after considering these rules,the letters in evidence,and testimony,the referee found that engaged in the unlicensed practice of law in illinois in violation of the rules regulating the florida bar.
the referee concluded that practiced law in the state of illinois,without permission to practice in that jurisdiction,in violation of the rules of professional conduct in both states.the referee recommended that be found guilty of violating rule regulating the florida bar a a lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction other than the lawyer home state,in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction,or in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in the lawyer home state or assist another in doing so.because knowingly and intentionally permitted,and even assisted,bolera in filing a false pleading in illinois by allowing bolera to use law office address as bolera address in a civil action,the referee recommended that be found guilty of violating rules regulating the florida bar c a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation and d a lawyer shall not engage in conduct in connection with the practice of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.because the foregoing misconduct was willful and intentional,the referee recommended that be found guilty of violating rules regulating the florida bar violation of the rules of professional conduct is a cause for discipline the commission by a lawyer of any act that is unlawful or contrary to honesty and justice,whether the act is committed in the course of the attorney relations as an attorney or otherwise,whether committed within or outside the state of florida,and whether or not the act is a felony or misdemeanor,may constitute a cause for discipline and a a lawyer shall not violate or attempt to violate the rules of professional conduct,knowingly assist or induce another to do so,or do so through the acts of another.
as to discipline,the referee recommended disbarment.in making this recommendation,the referee relied in part on cumulative misconduct.see.bar golden,so d,holding cumulative misconduct may be found when the misconduct occurs near in time to other offenses.bar lawless,so d recognizing that the court generally imposes a greater sanction for cumulative misconduct than for isolated misconduct.because the bar prevailed in this case,the referee recommended that the bar be awarded costs of.
the referee did not find any mitigating factors.with regard to aggravating factors,the referee found a prior disciplinary was admonished for incompetence by court order in april publicly reprimanded for neglect and trust accounting violations in july suspended for ninety days for misrepresentation in january and suspended for one year in october for contempt of court and violation of his previous suspension b dishonest or selfish motive c a pattern of misconduct d multiple offenses and e substantial experience in the practice of was admitted to the florida bar in.
sought review of the referee findings of fact,recommendations of guilt,and recommended sanction.the bar filed an answer brief and filed a reply brief.
first,asserts that the referee should have granted his motion to dismiss the bar complaint,which was denied on may.argues that the referee did not properly address his arguments regarding the bar impermissible tactics.he asserts that the bar intentionally delayed bringing the disciplinary case against him,assigned case number,until it could be considered with the contempt case.claims this constitutes the unfair practice of stacking cases against a respondent.see.bar rubin,so d providing that the bar is not free to withhold a referee report that it finds too lenient until additional cases can be developed against the affected attorney.argues that the referee did not fully address these arguments and that his motion should have been granted.
a ruling on a motion to dismiss based on a pure question of law is subject to de novo review.see.bar greene,so d,see also.bar roth,so d,providing that the court reviews the referee ruling on a motion to dismiss to determine if the referee erred.the may,order facially reflects that the referee held a hearing on may.one hour was scheduled for consideration of motion to dismiss.under florida law,motions to dismiss require the trier of fact to accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and consider the allegations in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see greene,so d at kaufman bus lines,so d dca.further,it is inappropriate for the referee to determine factual issues at that stage in the proceedings.see greene,so d at.pursuant to this case law,it would have been improper for the referee to have dismissed the disciplinary case,based simply on allegations of stacking.the referee was required to view the case in the light most favorable to the bar,and the referee could not assume that the bar had intentionally delayed the case.
in addition,approximately two months before the referee issued the order denying the motion to dismiss,had voluntarily agreed to consolidate the two cases.see agreed order consolidating cases for disciplinary recommendation report of referee.bar,nos.referee order filed.thus,claim that the bar engaged in stacking is meritless.in fact,the record reveals that counsel specifically stated during a hearing that agreed to the referee considering both cases together for the purposes of making a single recommendation of discipline.at that point,did not raise the stacking claims in fact,again agreed to joint consideration of the two cases.
thus,upon application of the law governing motions to dismiss,as well as agreement to consolidate the cases,we conclude that the referee properly denied motion to dismiss.
second,asserts that the referee abused his discretion by sua sponte taking judicial notice of the illinois rule regarding the unlicensed practice of law.this argument is also without merit.contrary to claims,the record indicates that the referee did not take judicial notice of these matters sua sponte rather,he did so at the request of bar counsel,in open court,during the hearing.counsel,who was present,did not object.
further,the referee did not take judicial notice of any disputable facts the referee took notice of another state published rules.section,florida statutes,plainly states that a court may take judicial notice of 
decisional,constitutional,and public statutory law of every other state,territory,and jurisdiction of the united states.
official actions of the legislative,executive,and judicial departments of the united states and of any state,territory,or jurisdiction of the united states.
rules of court of any court of this state or of any court of record of the united states or of any other state,territory,or jurisdiction of the united states.
pursuant to the statute,it is clear that the referee could take judicial notice of the illinois disciplinary rule and any related case law.
in addition,it is well established that bar disciplinary proceedings are rather than civil or criminal.the referee is not bound by the technical rules of evidence.on review,a referee decision regarding the admissibility of evidence will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.see.bar tobkin,so d.bar rotstein,so d.the referee did not abuse his discretion by taking judicial notice of the material provided by bar counsel in open court,during a hearing,regarding established illinois law.
third,asserts that the referee findings of fact are not supported by the evidence and,in turn,the findings of fact do not support the referee recommendation that be found guilty of violating the specified rules 
argument challenges the referee report on two levels both the findings of fact and the recommendations of guilt.this court has repeatedly stated that with regard to facts,this court review is limited,and if a referee findings of fact are supported by competent,substantial evidence in the record,this court will not reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the referee.see.bar frederick,so d,see also.bar jordan,so d.thus,has the burden to demonstrate that the referee findings of fact are unsupported.
next,the standard of review for a referee recommendations as to guilt is that the referee factual findings must be sufficient under the applicable rules to support the recommendations as to guilt.see.bar shoureas,so d.
contempt case.admits it was poor judgment to refer to himself as counsel to anglo bio tran in the letter he sent to california attorney kurtz while was suspended.nevertheless,claims that the statements in the letter were based on personal knowledge therefore,his actions should not be viewed as engaging in the practice of law in violation of his suspension.
findings of fact.has failed to meet his burden of showing that the referee findings of fact are unsupported.the record demonstrates that sent the letter to kurtz while was suspended.was suspended for one year,effective november,florida bar,so d,and he has not been reinstated.the letter to kurtz was dated june.
further,the text of the letter plainly states i am counsel to anglo bio tran.the subject line provides a reference to the potential case gould anglo bio trans.in addition,the referee is supported in finding that the letter provided legal opinions about the potential case,as the letter states 
the complaint you filed is bogus and does not reflect any agreement between gould advertising and any of the parties you identified in the complaint.the complaint is vague for several reasons,not the least of which is that no contract was ever entered into 
what you also failed to put in your complaint 
i will not advise to pay a nuisance claim,but have advised the parties to retain california counsel to defend this matter.they would then seek damages for the false representations your client has made.
although argues that his letter to kurtz did not represent legal opinions,his argument is erroneous.discussed several legal matters in his letter,such as the sufficiency of the complaint,the lack of a contract,and gould failure to include certain documents with the complaint.further,stated that he advised anglo bio tran not to pay a nuisance claim,to retain california counsel,and to seek damages.these statements constitute the expression of legal opinions.
we conclude that the referee findings of fact,that engaged in the practice of law while suspended and that he held himself out as a lawyer while suspended,are supported by competent,substantial evidence in the record.
recommendations of guilt.we conclude that the referee factual findings are sufficient to support the recommendations as to guilt.see shoureas,so d at.the referee found that acted in complete disregard of the court prior suspension order and is in contempt of the supreme court of florida.we continuing to practice law while suspended and holding himself out as an attorney,is guilty of violating the court order of suspension.
case no.disciplinary case.notes the referee found that he assisted bolera in filing and amending the civil action for malpractice in illinois.claims his actions did not constitute the practice of law because one does not need to be a licensed attorney to research law on the internet paralegals and untrained people eng
