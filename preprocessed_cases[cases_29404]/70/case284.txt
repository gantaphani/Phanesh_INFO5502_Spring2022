plaintiffs appellants karl tropf and catherine tropf the tropfs appeal the district court dismissal of their claims and imposition of sanctions.the tropfs claims arose out of a complicated set of real estate transactions in michigan in the and early,during which,the tropfs allege,the tropfs house was taken from them by fraudulent conveyance.a number of state court actions ensued,and the tropfs were denied relief by five separate state courts.following the denial of relief in the state courts,the tropfs filed two claims in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,consolidated before judge friedman,alleging that defendants appellees had illegally conspired to defraud them under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et,and that defendants appellees had violated their constitutional due process and equal protection rights under.defendants appellees,the persons who effected the alleged fraudulent conveyance,a number of banks who held mortgages on the property at issue,and the current owners of the property,filed motions to dismiss on the grounds that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case under the rooker feldman abstention doctrine,that the tropfs fraud,rico,and due process claims were precluded by res judicata,and that the tropfs failed to state a due process claim under federal rule of civil procedure b the district court granted defendants appellees motions to dismiss on all grounds,and further imposed monetary and injunctive sanctions on the tropfs and their counsel.for the following reasons,we affirm the dismissal of the tropfs claims and the imposition of monetary sanctions and an injunctive sanction related to the federal courts,but we reverse the imposition of an injunctive sanction related to the state courts and state administrative proceedings,and we remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background

federal court actions 
while their appeals were still pending in state court,the tropfs filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan on june,against mgb and its agents,century corporation,lynne wolenski and frank and jorg bierekoven,and certain appraisers.the complaint alleged that the defendants had conspired against the tropfs in violation of rico and had violated the tropfs due process and equal protection rights,and the tropfs sought monetary relief of more than ten million dollars.on november,the tropfs filed a second complaint against all of the above parties and fidelity national title insurance,chicago title insurance,and the zajacs,alleging the same violations of federal law and of the tropfs constitutional rights.the title insurance defendants and mgb subsequently filed motions to dismiss.
the district court consolidated the cases,and on march,granted the motions to dismiss and set a hearing for the imposition of sanctions.the district court found that the court lacked jurisdiction on the basis of the rooker feldman abstention doctrine the tropfs rico,fraud,due process,and equal protection claims were barred by res judicata and the tropfs failed to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b in regard to their due process and equal protection claims as pursued under.on april,after a hearing,the district court imposed sanctions permanently enjoining the tropfs and their attorney from filing any civil lawsuit in a united states district court alleging or asserting factual or legal claims based upon or arising out of any of the legal or factual claims alleged in these actions without written permission from the district court,forbidding the tropfs from filing any civil lawsuit in any state court or state administrative proceeding alleging or asserting the same legal or factual claims against any of the federal defendants without posting a surety bond or cash,and finding the tropfs jointly and severally liable with their attorney to mgb for monetary sanctions of and to the title insurance defendants for approximately.at april,order granting sanctions.the tropfs timely appealed.
on february,while the federal action was pending,the tropfs filed another claim in the oakland county circuit court against wolenski attorney,charles holzman.the tropfs initially alleged that holzman had committed a fraud on the state district court in the first action because he knew the warranty deed and land contract to be invalid.in an amended complaint filed on january,the tropfs also alleged that wolenski was a fictitious entity created by holzman.pursuant to the injunction issued on april,holzman moved for the district court to hold the tropfs in contempt.on april,the district court found that the tropfs had not posted a bond or cash in filing their amended complaint and issued an order of contempt and enjoining dismissing state court proceeding.the tropfs and their attorney filed an emergency motion in this court to stay the order on april.finding that the tropfs still had not posted the bond or cash as ordered,the district court issued a bench warrant for the arrest of karl tropf that day.the tropfs then filed another emergency motion in this court to recall the bench warrant.the tropfs and their attorney filed a notice of appeal.on may,pending the resolution of this appeal,a motions panel of this court stayed the order and the bench warrant.on august,however,the oakland county circuit court dismissed the tropfs action against holzman,finding that the action was filed in violation of a federal court order precluding the plaintiffs from filing any further federal or state proceedings relating to the transaction involved in this case.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss on the basis of subject matter jurisdiction.see nihiser ohio envtl.prot.agency,cir.we review a district court imposition of sanctions pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure for abuse of discretion.union planters bank l j dev,cir.we also review a district court grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.in re dublin,cir,cert.denied,d.
rooker feldman abstention 
in district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d,the supreme court held that federal court review of state court proceedings is jurisdictionally limited to the supreme court of the united states by see also patmon michigan,cir.we refer to this doctrine as the rooker feldman doctrine.see also rooker fidelity trust.the feldman court stated that united states district courts do not have jurisdiction over challenges to state court decisions in particular cases arising out of judicial proceedings even if those challenges allege that the state court action was unconstitutional.review of those decisions may only be had in this court.feldman,at.see also anderson charter township of ypsilanti,cir.in a more recent decision,the supreme court restated the doctrine as follows under the doctrine a party losing in state court is barred from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a united states district court,based on the losing party claim that the state judgment itself violates the loser federal rights.johnson de grandy,d.
we have held that there are two elements to a rooker feldman analysis.first,in order for the rooker feldman doctrine to apply to a claim presented in federal district court,the issue before the court must be inextricably intertwined with the claim asserted in the state court proceeding.catz chalker,cir quotation omitted.where federal relief can only be predicated upon a conviction that the state court was wrong,it is difficult to conceive the federal proceeding as,in substance,anything other than a prohibited appeal of the judgment.id.quotation omitted.second,the rooker feldman doctrine precludes federal court jurisdiction where the claim is a specific grievance that the law was invalidly even unconstitutionally applied in the plaintiff particular case.id.in contrast,the rooker feldman doctrine does not bar federal court jurisdiction where the claim is a general challenge to the constitutionality of the state law applied in the state action.id.see also patmon,at.
in this case,the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the rooker feldman abstention doctrine because c learly,plaintiffs complaints amount to nothing more than a challenge to various judgments against them.at opinion and order.the record fully supports this conclusion.in count i of their november,complaint before the district court,the tropfs directly attacked the state court judgments against them 
that the authorities in michigan will provide no remedy for the theft of plaintiffs land except that plaintiffs accept a collusive,unjust,and judgment and that the defendants be allowed to wrongfully confiscate the plaintiffs sic land without trial,or compensation violating the plaintiffs sic constitutional rights under the fourteenth amendment.
that the michigan courts have consistently refused to apply the michigan law applicable to the plaintiffs claims because of the collusive nature of the lawsuits,and,the decisions of the courts are inconsistent with michigan law,have been misapplied,unjustly enrich defendants and violate plaintiffs constitutional rights to be treated equally under the amendment.
at,compl.furthermore,all the rest of the tropfs claims not only appear to be inextricably intertwined with the state court judgments regarding the validity of the warranty deed and the land contract,but they also appear to be particular to the tropfs case.
the tropfs allege a variety of vague fraud and rico claims,as well as constitutional due process and equal protection violations under.see at,compl.all their claims,however,rely on the argument that the warranty deed and land contract executed by the tropfs and wolenski were fraudulent.because the warranty deed and the land contract were upheld in all of the state actions involving the tropfs the tropfs federal claims are therefore predicated on their conviction that the state courts were wrong the very definition of inextricably intertwined.moreover,the tropfs do not argue that any state law applied to them is itself unconstitutional instead,they argue only that their equal protection and due process rights were violated in the particular application of the state laws to their case.thus,the district court was correct in finding that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction based on the rooker feldman abstention doctrine.
because the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the tropfs case,it should not have reached the merits of the case.we therefore do not address the district court holdings as to res judicata and federal rule of civil procedure b.
following its grant of the defendants motions to dismiss,the district court held a hearing at which the court imposed three different types of sanctions on the tropfs and their attorney.although the district court dismissed the tropfs claims on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over them pursuant to the rooker feldman doctrine,we conclude that it was nonetheless permissible for the district court to impose on the tropfs and their attorney monetary sanctions and an injunctive sanction related to the federal courts.however,we conclude that it was impermissible for the district court to impose on the tropfs an injunctive sanction related to the state courts and state administrative proceedings.
monetary sanctions 
the district court found the tropfs jointly and severally liable with their attorney to mgb for costs and fees in the amount of and to the title insurance defendants for costs and fees in the amount of under,w henever any action or suit is dismissed in any district court for want of jurisdiction,such court may order the payment of just costs.in addition,the supreme court has held that district courts can impose sanctions pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,without impermissibly expanding the judicial authority conferred in article iii,in cases where it is later determined that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.willy coastal,d.in willy,the court stated that i t is well established that a federal court may consider collateral issues after an action is no longer pending a n imposition of a rule sanction is not a judgment on the merits of an action.rather,it requires the determination of a collateral issue whether the attorney has abused the judicial process,and,if so,what sanction would be appropriate.id.at.quoting cooter gell hartmarx,d 
rule requires that to the best of an attorney or unrepresented party knowledge,information,and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,claims,defenses,and other legal contentions presented to the court in a paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law and the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or,if specifically so identified,are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.b.if an attorney or a party violates these requirements,the district court may impose a sanction consisting of an order directing payment of some or all of the reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.c.however,monetary sanctions may not be imposed on represented parties for the violation of subsection b involving unwarranted legal contentions.c a see also union planters,at.in this circuit,the test for the imposition of rule sanctions is whether the individual conduct was reasonable under the circumstances.see id.quotation omitted.
the district court found that 
in this case,the plaintiffs have brought at least five lawsuits related to the same transaction.they have repeatedly lost in the state courts.they have brought suit twice against the zajacs,individuals who purchased property pursuant to a court order.moreover,they have unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the proceedings by filing countless motions with the court,requiring the defendants to respond,when the underlying action had no merit.
at opinion and order.we agree with the district court that the tropfs attorney presented frivolous legal arguments to the district court and that both the tropfs and their attorney presented factual allegations to the district court that patently lacked evidentiary support.the validity of the land contract and the warranty deed were litigated numerous times in the state courts for the tropfs and their attorney to attempt to litigate the issue again in federal on unsubstantiated legal and factual claims was unreasonable under the circumstances.we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing monetary sanctions on the tropfs and their attorney in the amount of the defendants costs and fees 
injunctive sanctions 
rule also authorizes the imposition of nonmonetary sanctions.c the sanction may consist of,or include,directives of a nonmonetary nature.the advisory committee notes to the rule emphasize that t he court has significant discretion in determining what sanctions,if any,should be imposed for a violation,subject to the principle that the sanctions should not be more severe than reasonably necessary to deter repetition of the conduct by the offending person or comparable conduct by similarly situated persons.in ortman thomas,cir,we modified a district court nonmonetary sanction under rule that had permanently enjoined a plaintiff from filing any civil lawsuit in federal court alleging or asserting factual or legal claims based upon or arising out of the legal or factual claims alleged in this action or any of the actions underlying it.ortman thomas,aff,cir.instead of the permanent injunction,we imposed a prefiling requirement,mandating that the plaintiff obtain certification from a magistrate judge that the claims were not frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose before filing further complaints.we held that w e do not believe a person can be absolutely foreclosed from initiating an action in a court of the united states,though it is permissible to require one who has abused the legal process to make a showing that a tendered lawsuit is not frivolous or vexatious before permitting it to be filed.ortman,at see also feathers chevron,cir there is nothing unusual about imposing prefiling restrictions in matters with a history of repetitive or vexatious litigation.filipas lemons,cir 
in this case,the district court permanently enjoined the tropfs and their attorney from filing any civil lawsuit in a united states district court alleging or asserting factual or legal claims based upon or arising out of any of the legal or factual claims alleged in these actions without written permission from the district court.at,order granting sanctions.although the tropfs do not have a history of vexatious or repetitive litigation in the federal courts,they do have such a history in the state courts regarding this matter.and as the district court found that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the tropfs claims under the rooker feldman doctrine because the claims had been litigated in the state courts,it is likely that any other federal court would also lack subject matter jurisdiction over the legal and factual claims that the tropfs allege in this case.we therefore conclude that the above injunction does not seem to be more severe than reasonably necessary to prevent the tropfs from filing further repetitive actions in the federal courts.
the district court also enjoined the tropfs from filing any civil lawsuit in any state court or administrative proceeding alleging or asserting a factual or legal claim based upon or arising out of any of the legal or factual claims alleged in these actions against the federal defendants without first posting a surety bond or cash in the amount of.at,order granting sanctions.this circuit has not addressed whether a district court can impose prefiling requirements on parties in state courts and state administrative proceedings.the fifth circuit,however,has pe
