the state of wisconsin and the nation entered into a compact enabling the nation to conduct certain gaming activities on its lands in exchange for making payments to wisconsin.after a disagreement arose,wisconsin sued the nation to compel arbitration and to appoint an arbitrator.the district court exercised jurisdiction and appointed an arbitrator.the nation appealed from that order,arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that wisconsin complaint failed to state a claim under the federal arbitration act.wisconsin later filed a motion seeking a substitute arbitrator,arguing that the original arbitrator had a conflict of interest.the district court denied the motion and wisconsin appealed.we conclude that no subject matter jurisdiction exists over the complaint.we also conclude that the nation is not entitled to sanctions or double costs for wisconsin allegedly frivolous appeal that wisconsin voluntarily moved to dismiss before the completion of briefing.
in,the state of wisconsin entered into a compact with the wisconsin winnebago tribe,which is now known as the nation the nation.the compact authorized the nation to conduct on its lands various class iii games such as slot machines and blackjack,regulated the gaming,and provided that the nation would pay wisconsin costs of regulation.the compact was amended first in and,relevant to this case,again in.the second amended compact expanded the permitted casino games to the full panoply of las gaming,including poker,roulette,keno,and craps.in exchange,the nation agreed to pay wisconsin million dollars in and,and,in subsequent years,a percentage of the nation net winnings decreasing incrementally from eight to six percent in years to.after that,the parties agreed to payments of six percent continuing in perpetuity.the second amended compact established a perpetual duration for the compact,with the possibility of renegotiating terms every years.it also waived sovereign immunity,and provided for dispute resolution through binding arbitration.
the second amended compact was executed on april,and submitted to the secretary of the interior for approval.the compact went into effect days later,after the secretary took no action to approve or disapprove of the compact.d c.just before the first thirty million dollar payment was due,the supreme court of wisconsin issued a decision addressing compact provisions similar to those in the second amended compact.panzer doyle,abrogated in part by dairyland greyhound park,doyle.the panzer decision addressed a compact between wisconsin and the forest county potawatomi which,like the compact at issue here,provided that the agreement would endure in perpetuity and waived wisconsin sovereign immunity.although the nation was not a party in the panzer case,the nation,along with other tribes,submitted an amici curiae brief supporting the validity of the compacts.ruling against the position of the tribes,the supreme court of wisconsin held that the governor of wisconsin lacked the authority to enter into a perpetual compact,to waive wisconsin sovereign immunity,or to agree to certain games that violate the wisconsin constitution and criminal code.id.at.
although the nation own compact was not directly invalidated by the panzer case,the nation second amendment to the compact contained terms similar to those in the potawatomi compact at issue in panzer.following the panzer decision,the nation ceased offering the offending games,withheld payments to wisconsin,and sought to renegotiate the relevant compact provisions.after failing to negotiate a resolution,the nation submitted a complaint in arbitration,in accordance with the compact,on june.the arbitration complaint alleged breaches of contract and breaches of good faith and fair dealing.
the parties then sought a mutually acceptable arbitrator,a contentious process that culminated in the present litigation.after striking each other proposed arbitrators,the parties withdrew the strikes and agreed to appoint one arbitrator each,who together would select an arbitrator to conduct the binding arbitration the two arbitrators conferred without success.the nation arbitrator suggested that they continue to negotiate until november,and that if an agreement were not reached by that date,then both parties could jointly petition the district court for the appointment of an arbitrator.before that date,wisconsin filed a complaint in the western district of wisconsin,along with a motion to compel arbitration and to appoint an arbitrator.the nation filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction,which also argued that the federal arbitration act faa does not apply to indian tribes or indian commerce and that the motion to compel lacked merit since no lapse in the negotiations occurred.
the district court determined that it had jurisdiction,that the faa applied,and that a lapse in the arbitration process had occurred.then,choosing from arbitrators proposed by both parties,the district court selected the honorable william norris,a retired federal judge,to conduct the arbitration.in the opinion of the district court,judge norris,one of the nation proposed arbitrators,had no conflict of interest or bias and had considerable and meaningful experience in both gaming and indian law,as was required by the compact.having ordered arbitration,the district court dismissed wisconsin action without prejudice,permitting the immediate reopening upon motion of either party where all issues have not been resolved by arbitration.the nation filed a notice of appeal,seeking to challenge the district court denial of its motion to dismiss,but not the appointment of judge norris.
as the parties prepared for arbitration,wisconsin learned that judge norris law firm,akin gump,had represented several indian tribes in compact negotiations and potentially would do so again in the future.wisconsin considered this a conflict of interest and accordingly filed a motion before the district court requesting the reopening of the case for the substitution of an arbitrator without conflicts.the district court denied the motion,although it noted that it may lack jurisdiction over the motion because of the pending appeal.wisconsin filed a notice of appeal from that order,which was docketed as appeal.we consolidated the two appeals.
less than two weeks after wisconsin filed its opening appellate brief in appeal,and about one week before the nation response brief was due,wisconsin notified the nation that it was willing to dismiss its appeal voluntarily.the next day,without having heard whether the nation agreed,wisconsin mailed to the court a motion to dismiss the appeal voluntarily,which was filed the following day.we requested a response from the nation.the nation responded that it supported wisconsin motion,but requested sanctions.since the parties disagreed about the costs,we denied the motion to dismiss.see fed.b the circuit clerk may dismiss a docketed appeal if the parties file a signed dismissal agreement specifying how costs are to be paid and pay any fees that are due.even though the parties agreed that wisconsin appeal would not proceed on the merits,we directed the nation to file a motion for sanctions,which remains for our adjudication.thus,before the court are both the nation appeal and the sanctions issue presented in wisconsin appeal.
the nation argues on appeal that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this case and that the faa does not apply to indian tribes or indian commerce.we begin with the jurisdictional issue,a question of law that we review de novo.america moneyline,coleman,cir.to determine whether subject matter jurisdiction exists,we look first to the complaint filed by wisconsin because federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff properly pleaded complaint.caterpillar,williams,d citation omitted.wisconsin claims that subject matter jurisdiction exists because the case arises from federal law.to arise under federal law,the law must create the cause of action.farmers union ins.crow tribe of indians,d quoting am.well works layne bowler.in
