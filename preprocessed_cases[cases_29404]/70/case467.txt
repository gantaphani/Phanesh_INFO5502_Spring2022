the district court sanctioned police officer andrew cohen and attorney waukeen mccoy collectively,cohen in for violating the court discovery protective order.after the district court remanded the case to state court in,and after the state court entered judgment,cohen appealed the district court sanctions order in.we are first asked to decide whether the remand order was a final order for purposes of permitting cohen to appeal the sanctions order.concluding that the remand order was final,we then must determine whether the appeal was timely filed under federal rule of appellate procedure a.we conclude that it was not and that we lack jurisdiction to hear cohen appeal.
eighteen san francisco police of whom were stationed in a comedy video in.finding the video offensive,police chief heather fong fong disciplined several of the participating police officers.in august,eighteen of those officers including andrew cohen,represented by mccoy,filed suit in state court,alleging race discrimination,retaliation,defamation,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.when the officers subsequently amended their complaint to include federal discrimination claims,ccsf removed the case to federal court on february.
fearing public disclosure of confidential,proprietary,or private information during the course of discovery,the parties agreed to a stipulated protective order protective order on august.the district court later held that mccoy and cohen violated the protective order when mccoy provided or showed a copy of the video of chief fong deposition to a reporter for abc news on september or september,even though fong counsel had designated the deposition as confidential.while mccoy had objected to designating fong deposition as confidential,he never pressed this objection to the court.citing this and three other examples of protective order violations none of which appellants dispute,the district court held mccoy and cohen in contempt.because the evidence of cohen violations was clear and convincing,the court concluded that sanctions for th eir contempt were appropriate to compensate ccsf for their noncompliance.
on november,cohen appealed to this court,arguing that the district court order held cohen in criminal contempt,and that the court should have therefore provided procedural protections.in an unpublished order,we conclude d that the district court found cohen in civil contempt and that the district court imposed monetary sanctions against cohen to compensate ccsf for losses sustained when cohen violated the district court protective order and to coerce compliance with the district court protective order in the future.because cohen was held in civil contempt,we concluded,the sanctions order was not an immediately appealable order,and we sua sponte dismissed the appeal.see bingman ward,cir kordich marine clerks ass n,cir per curiam.
on january,the district court granted in part appellants motion for clarification of the court contempt order.the court made clear that the sanctions imposed on cohen were civil,not criminal,because the court awarded sanctions to defendants to compensate them for injuries associated with the improper disclosure of chief fong deposition,and because the court intended in part to coerce plaintiffs to comply with the protective order in the future.
on october,the district court granted cohen motion to dismiss all federal claims and remand the case to state court.citing a,and relying on its discretion to remand a properly removed case to state court when no federal claim remains,the district court concluded that the interests of judicial economy,comity and convenience favor ed remand to state court for determination of the state law issues that exclusively control led this case.on october,the district court issued an amended clerk notice,in which the district court clerk notified the san francisco superior court of the remand and transmitted the docket materials.on july,the san francisco superior court entered summary judgment on most of cohen claims.cohen filed a notice of appeal to this court on july.
we may not proceed to the merits of this appeal until we are satisfied that we have jurisdiction.hawaii office of hawaiian affairs.whether we have jurisdiction depends on affirmative answers to two questions.first,does cohen appeal arise from a final decision of a district court of the united states.second,has cohen filed a notice of appeal within the time required by federal rule of appellate procedure a see bowles russell.if the answer to either question is no,we must dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.we now turn to these questions.
decisions from which a party may appeal under come in two varieties.typically,a final decision under is one by which a district court disassociates itself from a case.mohawk,carpenter,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.jurisdiction under may also arise,however,from a small class of collateral rulings.id.at.under the collateral order exception,an appellate court may exercise its jurisdiction to review a district court order that is not a final decision.mcelmurry bank ass n,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.see also cohen beneficial indus.loan,u.
here,cohen challenges only the district court sanctions order.the difficulty for us is whether and how we may reach the merits of that order.it is law of the case that the sanctions order was not immediately appealable,which leaves two other possible orders from which cohen could be appealing the sanctions order the district court remand order or,as cohen argues,the california superior court summary judgment order.we can dismiss the latter possibility by quick reference to,which limits our jurisdiction to all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.emphasis added.the state court summary judgment order obviously did not arise from a district court of the united states.the other possibility is more intriguing,but requires us to answer two related questions.first,is a remand order appealable second,is a remand order a final rather than a collateral order such that prior orders in the as the district court sanctions order be appealed with it the answer to both questions is yes.
under d,a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.contrary to what appears to be the most natural reading of this provision,the supreme court has explained that d does not prohibit review of all types of remands.cal.of water res.powerex,cir.instead,d is limited by c,which permits a district court to remand because the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.reading these provisions in pari materia,the supreme court has held that only remands based on grounds specified in c are immune from review under d.quackenbush allstate ins,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,if a district court remands a case to state court for any reason other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction,its remand order is appealable under.
applying these principles,the supreme court recently held that a district court dismissal of all federal claims and subsequent remand to state court after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under a,is not based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction for purposes of c and can be appealed.carlsbad,hif bio,see also powerex,at coming to the same conclusion.these principles leave little doubt that the district court remand order here,in which the court expressly used its discretion under c to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction,was an appealable order.
that conclusion,however,does not end the inquiry,because,as mentioned above,cohen is challenging the sanctions order,not the remand order.we may review the sanctions order as part of cohen appeal from the remand order only if the district court remand order was a final,and not a collateral,order.generally,earlier rulings can be reviewed on appeal from final judgment.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed hereinafter wright miller see also united states acres of land,cir in the absence of any indication that the appellant affi
