defendant sefcu,a lender,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york suddaby,reversing an order of the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of new york littlefield,and remanding the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.the district court concluded that sefcu violated the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code,when,after lawfully repossessing a vehicle belonging to the debtor,plaintiff christopher weber,it failed to deliver the vehicle to him notwithstanding its knowledge of the debtor pending petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the district court affirmed,holding that,by declining to surrender the vehicle absent a turnover order and protection sefcu considered adequate,the lender wrongfully exercised control over the vehicle in contravention of section and was liable for weber related damages,attorneys fees,and costs.
on appeal to our court,sefcu challenges the district court interpretation of section and other relevant provisions of the bankruptcy code,and argues that,under the authority of manufacturers traders trust alberto in re alberto,it was entitled to retain the vehicle notwithstanding the pending bankruptcy proceedings.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court and remand the cause to the district court for a determination of the amount of damages,costs,and attorneys fees that sefcu owes weber under section k,and any other proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the relevant facts are undisputed 
in august,weber and sefcu identified in bankruptcy court pleadings as the state employees federal credit union entered into a loan agreement pursuant to which sefcu obtained a security interest in weber vehicle,a pickup truck.the loan agreement entitled sefcu to repossess weber vehicle upon default.
in,sefcu became entitled to proceed against weber.as a result,on january,sefcu took possession of weber vehicle pursuant to the loan agreement,and,by notices dated january and,advised him of his right under new york law to redeem the vehicle upon payment of amounts due and certain costs.four days after the seizure,on january,weber filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code,e,in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of new york.weber attorney concurrently gave sefcu written notice of weber bankruptcy filing,and,invoking the stay imposed by bankruptcy code section,a,requested the vehicle return.
one week later,sefcu still had the vehicle,and accordingly,on january,weber filed an adversary proceeding against sefcu seeking its return so that,as later explained by his counsel to the bankruptcy court,he could continue his construction business during the pendency of his petition.on march,with the vehicle still in sefcu possession,the bankruptcy court entered an order requiring sefcu to show cause why it should not return the vehicle and why the court should not grant weber an award of damages for sefcu violation of section and for other relief.on march,the court heard argument on the order to show cause,and,although the record does not reflect entry of a related order at that time,sefcu is reported to have returned the vehicle to weber the following day.
the proceedings in the bankruptcy court continued,as weber sought damages for his inability to use the vehicle between january and march,attorneys fees,and sanctions.in november,sefcu moved for summary judgment,putting to the bankruptcy court the question of law whether sefcu failure to release the vehicle promptly after the petition was filed constituted a willful violation of the automatic stay under subsections a and k of section providing for recovery of damages,costs,and attorneys fees for any willful violation of a stay.sefcu maintained that there was no violation,and that an earlier district court decision in other proceedings,alberto,gave it a reasonable basis for declining to release the vehicle absent a court order issued pursuant to bankruptcy code section,relating to turnover of property to the estate.weber,for his part,argued that alberto was wrongly decided,and that section required sefcu to release the vehicle promptly after the petition was filed.the bankruptcy court,in a brief order,granted summary judgment for sefcu.
weber appealed to the district court.relying primarily on the supreme court decision in united states whiting pools,d,and rejecting the reasoning of the alberto court,the district court concluded that sefcu was bound to release the vehicle to weber,the,upon learning of weber pending chapter proceedings.the district court further determined that,having failed to do so,sefcu violated section.because it knew of the petition and retained the vehicle,sefcu violation was willful,making it liable for damages and attorneys fees.weber sefcu.sefcu timely appealed.
discussion 
we conduct a plenary review of a decision of a district court functioning in its capacity as an appellate court in a bankruptcy case.mazzeo united states in re mazzeo,cir.thus,we review de novo the bankruptcy court legal conclusions.resolution trust best prods.in re best prods,cir.as noted above,the relevant facts are not contested we have no occasion to subject them to further review.
under bankruptcy code section,governing property of the estate,the act of filing a petition for bankruptcy creates an estate comprised of as relevant here all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case.a.section gathers into the estate all such interests in property,wherever located and by whomever held.id.a.
to assemble the bankruptcy estate,section of the code requires that,during bankruptcy proceedings,an entity in possession,custody,or control of certain property in the estate shall deliver that property to the trustee,unless such property is of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate.a emphasis added.the property subject to this delivery obligation is property that the trustee may use,sell,or lease under section,which grants broad powers over the estate property to the trustee id.in a chapter bankruptcy,the debtor remain s in possession of all property of the estate acting in effect as trustee under section a unless the debtor reorganization plan provides otherwise.b the delivery obligation of section a thus contemplates the as the recipient of the property of the estate.
while bankruptcy proceedings are pending,the automatic stay provisions of section work with sections and to shelter the debtor estate from action by creditors,enabling the debtor to get the relief and fresh start that are among the goals of the bankruptcy regime thus,under section,filing a bankruptcy petition automatically effects a stay of any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate.a.those who violate section are liable for related damages and costs under section k,a debtor injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by section shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees,and,in appropriate circumstances,may recover punitive damages.id.k emphasis added.
we first consider whether sefcu refusal to return the vehicle to weber promptly upon learning of his chapter bankruptcy filing constituted an unlawful exercise of control over the property of his estate,in violation of the automatic stay.we then examine whether sefcu may be excused from promptly surrendering the vehicle because weber had not provided adequate protection for sefcu security interest in the vehicle.finally,because we conclude that sefcu actions did violate section,we then turn to the question whether,in light of its reliance on alberto,sefcu violation was nonetheless willful under section k,making it liable for weber actual damages,costs,and attorneys fees under that section.
as observed above,section a provides that a bankruptcy estate is comprised of all legal or equitable interests in property as of the commencement of the case.although sefcu repossession of the vehicle before weber filed his petition lawfully overrode weber immediate possessory rights,the parties agree that new york law afforded weber at least a continuing equitable interest in the vehicle.see wornick gaffney,cir whether the debtor has a legal or equitable interest in property such that it becomes property of the estate under section is determined by applicable state law.internal quotation marks omitted.that interest arose from weber right pursuant to the state uniform commercial code to redeem the vehicle before sale.see it was this right that sefcu acknowledged and identified for weber in its notice to him dated january.weber equitable interest thus constituted property of the bankruptcy estate under section.neither party seriously challenges the scope of that definition.
rather,weber and sefcu dispute whether,by failing to surrender the vehicle immediately upon receiving notice of the petition filing,sefcu exercise d control over weber equitable interest in the vehicle and thereby violated the stay imposed by section.the supreme court decision in united states whiting pools,d,provides important guidance for our resolution of this issue.
the dispute in whiting pools arose when,to satisfy a tax lien,the irs seized all of the tangible personal property of the corporation.one day after the seizure,the corporation filed for bankruptcy.the irs moved for relief from the automatic stay,wishing to be free to sell the personal property that it had seized in satisfaction of the tax debts owed.the debtor corporation counterclaimed and,in the bankruptcy court,successfully sought an order under section that required the irs to return the property to the estate.id.at.
the supreme court affirmed the bankruptcy court turnover order.characterizing the irs interest in the seized property as its lien not ownership and analogizing the service right to effect a seizure to the remedies available to private secured creditors,the court described the seizure as not determin ing the service rights to the seized property,but merely bring ing the property into the service legal custody.id.at.it explained that i n effect,a grants to the estate a possessory interest in certain property of the debtor that was not held by the debtor at the commencement of reorganization proceedings,id.at,and requires an entity holding any property of the debtor that the trustee can use under to turn that property over to the trustee.id.at.
the court underscored the congressional intent,in shaping the definition of property set forth in section a,to include a broad range of property in the estate,and indeed,to capture any property made available to the estate by other provisions of the bankruptcy code.id.at.section a is such a provision.it requires delivery to the trustee of any property of the debtor that the trustee can use under,including property repossessed by a secured creditor.id.at.any other interpretation of a,the court declared,would deprive the bankruptcy estate of the assets and property essential to its rehabilitation effort and thereby would frustrate the congressional purpose behind the reorganization provisions.id.at.
for these reasons,the court restricted the irs like any other creditor seizing property in which it held a security interest to seeking protection of its interests according to the congressionally established bankruptcy procedures,rather than by withholding the seized property from the debtor efforts to reorganize.id.at.
similarly,here,sefcu seized weber vehicle before weber filed for bankruptcy,but under new york law,weber retained at least an equitable interest in the property notwithstanding its repossession.sefcu did not automatically obtain an ownership interest in the vehicle its rights to seize and sell were subject to provisions of state law,including certain continuing rights held by weber,and also subject to the rights and remedies established by the bankruptcy code.whiting pools teaches that,upon weber filing of his bankruptcy petition,weber equitable interest under state law gave the bankruptcy estate a possessory right in the secured property,as property that the trustee could use under section.under section,that right took precedence over the state law possessory right of sefcu.see id.at.
it is true that whiting pools involved a chapter corporate reorganization,and that the supreme court expressly reserved judgment as to whether its analysis would also apply to chapter personal reorganizations like weber.at.but,like other courts to have addressed the issue,we observe that the language of sections,and applies to the estate,not just the reorganization estate.see austein schwartz in re gerwer,cir cited in in re velichko.we see no reason and the parties have presented none to restrict application of the reasoning of the whiting pools court to corporate reorganizations the same concerns apply fully in the chapter context as well.see,thompson general motors acceptance,cir applying whiting pools in chapter setting and observing that the purpose of reorganization bankruptcy,be it corporate or personal,is to allow the debtor to regain his financial foothold and repay his creditors emphasis added.as noted above,weber required his vehicle to conduct his construction business whiting pools required its equipment and other personal property to conduct its business.in each case,the reorganization chances for success would seem markedly improved if operations could be maintained during the pendency of the petition and formulation of the plan.
whiting pools does not resolve,however,whether by demanding a turnover order of the bankruptcy court or adequate protection as a condition of its relinquishment,sefcu exercise d control over the vehicle in contravention of the stay.in whiting pools,the irs unlike sefcu moved for relief from the stay,and did not simply wait for the debtor to initiate an adversary proceeding or seek a turnover order under section.id.at.thus,the court there held only that the bankruptcy court properly ordered the irs to return the seized property to the estate under section.id.at.
the district court decision in alberto,relied upon by sefcu here,directly addressed the question left unanswered by whiting pools.the alberto court concluded that a secured creditor did not violate the automatic stay when,after learning of the debtor bankruptcy,it failed immediately to return a debtor repossessed vehicle.at.rather,the court held that before such a secured creditor was obligated to surrender the collateral to the estate,the debtor must take an affirmative step,such as obtaining a turnover order under section.id.at.because as it found a repossessed vehicle was not part of the debtor estate until such an action had occurred,the court reasoned that a creditor that had taken possession of its security did not exercise control over property of the estate by declining to surrender the possessory interest to the estate.id.at.since the debtor no longer had a possessory interest,the court concluded,the creditor did not act to obtain possession or to exercise control of the vehicle in violation of the stay,since it already lawfully possessed and controlled the vehicle when the stay went into effect.id.at alteration in original quoting a.
we find the alberto court reasoning unpersuasive.section expressly provides that the property of weber estate includes equitable interests,and weber right to redeem and other rights catalogued above,together with his lingering claim to ownership of title,comprise such an interest.that sefcu had already effected a repossession does not alter the conclusion that the equitable interest is property of the estate section provides further that the estate is comprised of property wherever located and by whomever held.a.nor was weber obligated to initiate an additional proceeding.section requires that any entity in possession of property of the estate deliver it to the trustees,without condition or any further action the provision is.collier on bankruptcy ed.by its express terms,section is,and does not require that the trustee take any action or commence a proceeding or obtain a court order to compel the turnover.and whiting pools teaches that the filing of a petition will genera
