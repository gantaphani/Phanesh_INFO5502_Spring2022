this is a companion case to angiodynamics biolitec ag.in this appeal,defendants challenge the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction over certain defendants,the denial of their motions to dismiss,and the entry of default judgment and a damages award against them as a sanction for discovery violations.finding all arguments meritless,we affirm.
facts background 
this court previously set out the basic factual contours of this case in angiodynamics,biolitec ag,cir per curiam.plaintiff angiodynamics,adi obtained a million judgment in new york against defendant biolitec,bi,a new jersey corporation with its principal place of business in massachusetts,based on an indemnification clause in the supply and distribution agreement governing bi sale of medical equipment to adi.plaintiff sought to secure payment on that judgment by bringing suit in the district of massachusetts against bi president and ceo,wolfgang neuberger,and its corporate parents,biomed technology holdings biomed and biolitec ag bag collectively,defendants alleging that defendants had looted bi of over million in assets in order to render it.specifically,the complaint alleged tortious interference with contractual relations,fraudulent transfers of assets in violation of the massachusetts uniform fraudulent transfer act mufta.laws ch,and deceptive commercial acts or practices in violation of.laws ch,chapter.the complaint also demanded a declaratory judgment that neuberger,biomed,and bag were jointly and severally liable for adi judgment against bi in the underlying contract action under the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil.
we will recount only the portions of the procedural background of this case pertinent to the issues raised in this appeal.adi filed its amended complaint on march.bag filed a motion to dismiss,averring that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over the german company and that three counts of adi complaint failed to state a claim.the district court denied the motion in a lengthy memorandum and order.angiodynamics,biolitec ag,cv map,wl,at.july.four days later,biomed and neuberger filed their own motion to dismiss,raising substantially similar arguments as bag motion personal jurisdiction as to biomed,and failure to state a claim on three counts as to both biomed and neuberger.the district court denied this second motion on the same grounds as the first.
as the parties began discovery,defendants resisted adi efforts to depose neuberger and other key witnesses.adi served neuberger with a notice of deposition in july,but he indicated he would not attend.after adi filed a motion to compel his attendance at the deposition,neuberger agreed to come and adi withdrew its motion.neuberger attended the first day of the deposition in springfield,massachusetts,in january,but the parties were forced to postpone the remainder of the deposition until defendants produced various documents for adi review.in july,defendants filed a motion for a protective order to stay neuberger deposition.the magistrate judge assigned to this case denied the motion as,inter alia,untimely and unfairly prejudicial to adi.defendants refused to produce neuberger,and filed a second motion for a protective order seeking to continue the deposition by videolink the magistrate judge denied this motion as well.similar issues arose in relation to the depositions of three key bi corporate officers the parties agreed to suspend their depositions until defendants produced various documents.subsequently,defendants refused to produce any of the documents or the three witnesses.adi filed two motions for sanctions based on the defendants failure to turn over the key documents and refusal to produce either neuberger or the three managing agents.
during the discovery period,adi learned that defendants planned to merge bag with its austrian subsidiary.adi moved for a temporary restraining order and then for a preliminary injunction to prevent the merger,arguing that adi would be unable to enforce any judgment against bag in the austrian courts.the district court enjoined the merger and this court affirmed the issuance of the preliminary injunction.angiodynamics,at.while that appeal was pending,defendants effected the merger anyway.adi moved for contempt proceedings,and the district court ordered neuberger to appear in person to show cause why he should not be held in contempt.neuberger did not appear.on april,the district court held defendants in contempt for violating the preliminary injunction and ordered coercive penalties against defendants until they undid the merger.angiodynamics,biolitec ag,d.this contempt order is the subject of the companion case to this opinion,angiodynamics biolitec ag.
approximately a month later,on may,adi moved for default judgment based on defendants failure to comply with the contempt order.the district court denied the motion on august,but ordered defendants to file a status report detailing their plan for complying with the contempt decision and for producing neuberger to the district court to testify as to his actions in response to the injunction.angiodynamics,biolitec ag,d.defendants status report,dated october,stated definitively that they had no intention of complying with the contempt order.see angiodynamics,biolitec ag,d.on october,adi filed a renewed motion for default judgment based on defendants status report,which the district court heard along with adi two motions for sanctions for violations of various discovery orders.on january,the district court allowed the motions for sanctions and entered default judgment for adi id.at.on march,the court awarded approximately million to adi,which included chapter damages.angiodynamics,biolitec ag,d.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
personal jurisdiction 
defendants begin by positing that the default judgment is void as to bag,bi parent corporation,and biomed,bag primary shareholder,for lack of personal jurisdiction defendants aver that even if the court could impute bi contacts with the forum to bag and biomed for personal jurisdiction purposes,the district court was required to conduct an independent analysis of each of the defendants contacts with massachusetts.defendants argument relies on two recent supreme court cases,goodyear dunlop tires operations,brown,and daimler ag bauman.we need not reach this particular argument because jurisdiction is so clearly established in this case.
it is undisputed that the district of massachusetts could properly exercise personal jurisdiction over bi,a corporation with its principal place of business in massachusetts,making bi at home in this forum.see daimler.at.adi must make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction sufficient to overcome defendants rule b motion to dismiss.see phillips prairie eye,cir where the district court does not hold an evidentiary hearing on a jurisdictional question,this court reviews the proffered evidence to determine whether the plaintiff has established a prima facie showing of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.adi complaint alleged that defendants looted bi by fraudulently transferring its assets out of massachusetts,and thereby rendering bi unable either to perform its contractual duties owed to adi or to satisfy the judgment due to adi.this conduct gives rise to each of the counts in the complaint and was materially connected to the forum state because it occurred here,harlow children,cir citing united,radio mach.workers pleasant,cir.thus,as the district court discussed at length in its memorandum and order,adi allegations suffice to establish jurisdiction over bag and biomed,and the cases cited by defendants do not require a different result.angiodynamics,wl,at.
motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim 
defendants argue that the default judgment is void as to all defendants because adi complaint fails to state valid causes of action for tortious interference with contractual relations,veil piercing,and mufta violations the district court rejected defendants arguments when it denied their rule b motion to dismiss,angiodynamics,wl,at,denied their motion for partial judgment on the pleadings as to the mufta claims,an
