background 
plaintiffs are current and former northwest qsas.northwest created the qsa position in to perform a variety of functions such as escorting unaccompanied minors through airports and acting as meeters and greeters at northwest terminals.prior to,qsas were,employees.during this time,northwest set pay levels for qsas that varied based on employment location and specialized skills such as language abilities.raises were awarded on a system rather than a pay scale.qsas also enjoyed various employment benefits,including travel pass privileges,which allowed them to travel ahead of most other northwest employees.
defendants include the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam air transport district district robert depace in his capacity as president and directing general chair of district lodge and sandra weber in her capacity as general chair and lead negotiator for clerical,office,fleet and passenger service employees cofps of district.the iam is an international labor organization that represents,among many other individuals,northwest qsas.district is an intermediate level body within the iam.under the railway labor act rla,which governs labor relations in the airline industry,district has exclusive collective bargaining responsibility for various crafts or classes of employees at northwest,including qsas.
in,the iam attempted to unionize the qsas and led a campaign to collect authorization cards for a national mediation board nmb election.the nmb is the federal agency charged with determining representation disputes arising under the rla.u,ninth.on february,the iam decided to seek accretion of the qsas into the existing cofps craft or class rather than proceed with an election.northwest opposed this accretion proposal.on april,the nmb issued a final decision that northwest qsas should be accreted into the cofps craft or class because qsas and cofps employees share a community of interests in that their duties are exclusively passenger service.the nmb noted that the cofps craft or class was comprised of approximately employees,compared to qsas.in an effort to avoid fragmentation and instability,the nmb found that an election was unwarranted.
following the april,nmb decision,depace,the president and directing general chair of district lodge,requested that northwest meet to negotiate an interim collective bargaining agreement cba for the newly accreted qsas.the cofps cba in effect at the time did not expire until february.according to depace,northwest was not legally obligated to open this agreement prior to its expiration and was unwilling to do so because extending its benefits to qsas would be costly.on july,various qsas sent a letter to depace,expressing their discontent with the outcome of the accretion decision.district sent representatives to meet with qsas and established a number for qsas to contact the union with questions and concerns relating to the upcoming negotiations for an interim agreement.on august,depace issued a bulletin informing qsas that the interim agreement would not be voted upon,but was merely intended to cover the qsas until the expiration of the cofps cba on february.
on october,district and northwest entered into a letter of agreement pertaining to the qsas,commonly referred to as the accretion agreement.following the execution of the accretion agreement,qsas were required to pay union dues even though they had not voted for a contract.although district was unable to incorporate qsas into the existing cofps cba,the accretion agreement did secure several benefits.most importantly,qsas were able to maintain their passes until february.the agreement also established,among other things,a pay increase schedule,the accrual of vacation time,protection against discipline,a separate seniority district for qsas,and bidding on schedules.the accretion agreement,however,did not define qsa seniority in terms of pay factor that would become relevant during the bankruptcy negotiations.
following the negotiation and execution of the accretion agreement in late,qsas allege that depace and the iam leadership became openly hostile to qsas and their complaints.in particular,qsas claim that depace referred to them as whiners and wished he could give them back to northwest.qsas also allege that complaints made to iam leadership about the union poor representation were ignored.
shortly after the execution of the accretion agreement,the airline industry suffered a period of tremendous upheaval and substantial losses.from through,major american air carriers lost billion.northwest,in particular,lost billion between and the third quarter of.during this period,the cofps cba expired and became open for negotiation on february.sandra weber was elected as the cofps craft or class representative,and thomas roth,a labor economist,acted as the iam financial consultant during the negotiations.although a qsa employee failed to be elected as a cofps negotiation representative,the iam permitted two qsas to serve as negotiation liaisons.
after nearly two years of negotiations,no agreement was reached.on august,the iam and northwest signed a tentative agreement that extended most of the cofps cba provisions to qsas.the agreement,however,specified that qsa pay rates were still to be negotiated and seniority dates were still to be assigned.on september,less than one month after signing the tentative agreement,northwest filed for chapter bankruptcy.northwest proceeded to invoke section of the bankruptcy code,permitting an employer to reject a cba if rejection is found necessary for a successful reorganization.c.while northwest section motion was pending,the bankruptcy court approved an emergency pay cut for all employees.by september,northwest made it clear to the iam that its goal was to cut labor costs by million per year,including million in labor savings from employees.although northwest proposed a pay cut for most employees,including qsas,it ultimately granted the iam flexibility to determine how the labor savings should be achieved.
from january,to january,iam and northwest negotiators engaged in meetings in new york.if the negotiators failed to reach an agreement,northwest would be free to alter wages,work rules,and benefits at will.the two qsa liaisons were permitted to attend the january meetings but were asked to leave the room when the elected negotiators discussed qsa salaries.northwest chief negotiator,julie hagen showers,stated after the negotiations that the fairest solution was to impose an pay cut for all iam members.
once the percentage pay cut was set,patrick clay,northwest finance representative,and thomas roth,the iam financial consultant,worked together to create pay scales to reflect the pay cut for each employee group.operating under the general directive that all employees were to take an pay cut from current salaries,roth and clay encountered a challenge with the out of the employees.unlike other cofps employees,qsas did not have an existing pay scale.as noted previously,qsa salaries prior to joining the iam were and varied based on factors such as location and language skills.if qsas were transferred directly to a pay scale,it was possible for a qsa with significant seniority,but a low salary,to receive a pay raise rather than an pay cut.
as a result,roth and clay developed a new pay scale for the qsas.prior to the accretion agreement,qsas were paid an hourly rate,starting at per hour and topping out at per hour subject to increases.according to the new pay scale,a qsa would earn per hour,continuing up to for a qsa and thereafter.to determine a qsa position on the newly created scale,roth and clay first reduced the existing salary of every qsa by the same as all other cofps employees.they then took the resulting wages from all qsas after the pay cut and assigned each one to the corresponding level on the new pay scale.a qsa position on the new pay scale thus did not reflect his or her actual years of service,but rather his or her prior wage,which was a function of merit increases based on factors such as location and language abilities.
after each qsa had been assigned to a new pay level,roth persuaded northwest to place all qsas at the pay scale level,despite the fact that this rounding method meant that on average qsas experienced only an pay cut the new pay scale established a track for qsas to progress based on service,like all other cofps members,rather than on merit increases.the completed pay scales for all iam members,including qsas,were reviewed by lead negotiators showers and depace before they were submitted to the iam membership for a ratification vote.
on january,the iam posted northwest proposed bankruptcy agreement on the internet and mailed it to union members.many qsas saw the qsa pay scale and believed they would be placed on the scale according to their years of service even if it resulted in a pay increase.on february,david driscoll,a labor relations officer at northwest,issued an email clarifying the qsa pay scale.the email explained that all qsas would be subject to the same pay cut applicable to all iam employees.it was not the case that some qsas would receive a pay raise in certain cases up to.
on march,the iam announced that the cofps membership,including the qsas,ratified the bankruptcy agreement by a vote of to.those qsas who opposed the ratified agreement signed three different from each of the major northwest hubs detroit,minneapolis,and that they wished to resign their union membership and become.the letters were drafted by counsel and posted in work areas for signatures.qsas do not dispute the fact that the iam has a written policy covering dues objections,which is published to represented employees.the policy provides that requests must be in the form of a letter and include the objector signature and address.despite the assistance of legal counsel in preparing the letters,no addresses were included and in many cases the signatures were illegible.
during the course of litigation,defendants filed a motion for rule sanctions,alleging that plaintiffs counsel failed to sufficiently research the underlying facts and existing law before filing the complaint.this alleged failure resulted in the naming of plaintiffs who were never employed by northwest as qsas,who were not qsas during the relevant time periods,and who never made requests or were not paying dues at the time their requests were made.the district court granted in part and denied in part defendants rule motion,concluding that plaintiffs counsel failed to take minimal investigatory steps prior to filing the complaint.the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on counts i and ii,finding that plaintiffs failed to produce evidence that raised a genuine issue of material fact that defendants breached their duty of fair representation.
plaintiffs now appeal,claiming that the district judge erred by applying the deferential arbitrary standard to their claims that defendants conduct was unlawfully discriminatory and thereby breached their duty of fair representation.plaintiffs contend that this deferential standard does not apply to allegations of discrimination and,had the district court applied the appropriate standard,it would have found the existence of genuine issues of material fact on counts i and ii.plaintiffs also contest the grant of rule sanctions.

standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.allen highlands hosp,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the nonmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby.
a district court award of rule sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion.rentz dynasty apparel,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.brown raymond,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
duty of fair representation tripartite standard 
a union duty of fair representation to its members is judicially implied under the railway labor act.see generally steele louisville nashville.this duty is also applicable to air carriers.the duty of fair representation requires a union to serve the interests of all members without hostility or discrimination toward any,to exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty,and to avoid arbitrary conduct.vaca sipes,u,citations omitted.this duty applies in all contexts of union activity,including contract negotiation,administration,enforcement,and grievance processing.williams molpus,cir citing air line pilots ass n,int l.a breach of the duty of fair representation occurs only when a union conduct toward a member of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary,discriminatory,or in bad faith.vaca,at.
under this tripartite standard,a court should look to each element when determining whether a union violated its duty,at.therefore,the three separate levels of inquiry are as follows did the union act arbitrarily did the union act discriminatorily or did the union act in bad faith.griffin air line pilots ass n,int l,cir.in order to successfully defend against a motion for summary judgment on a duty of fair representation claim,the plaintiff must point the court to evidence in the record supporting at least one of these elements.e.
a union actions breach the duty of fair representation under the arbitrary prong if the union conduct can fairly be characterized as so far outside a wide range of reasonableness that it is wholly irrational.see,at internal citation omitted.a union acts in bad faith when it acts with an improper intent,purpose,or motive encompass ing fraud,dishonesty,and other intentionally misleading conduct.spellacy airline pilots ass l,cir citing baxter united paperworkers int l union,local,cir.although it is difficult to provide a precise definition of discriminatory conduct that breaches the duty of fair representation,the supreme court in amalgamated ass of street,electric railway motor coach employees of america lockridge,held that the duty carries with it the need to adduce substantial evidence of discrimination that is intentional,severe,and unrelated to legitimate union objectives.see also vaca,at noting that the duty of fair representation developed in a series of cases alleging racial discrimination that was irrelevant or invidious and served no legitimate union objectives.
without more,merely alleging that a union conduct favored one group over another does not constitute a breach of the duty of fair representation.the power of the union to exercise its discretion and to draw reasonable distinctions among groups of employees during the bargaining process was originally emphasized in ford motor huffman.in huffman,the supreme court upheld a union discretion to award generous seniority credit to military veterans.id.at.the court in huffman emphasized that a union authority to negotiate derives its principal strength from a delegation to the negotiators of a discretion to make such concessions and accept such advantages as,in the light of all relevant considerations,they believe will best serve the interests of the parties represented.id.at.the court continued 
inevitably differences arise in the manner and degree to which the terms of any negotiated agreement affect individual employees and classes of employees.the mere existence of such differences does not make them invalid.the complete satisfaction of all who are represented is hardly to be expected.a wide range of reasonableness must be allowed a statutory bargaining representative in serving the unit it represents,subject always to complete good faith and honesty of purpose in the exercise of its discretion.
following huffman,the supreme court in,in reversing the fifth circuit,emphasized that any substantive examination of a union performance must be highly deferential,recognizing the wide latitude that negotiators need for the effective performance of their bargaining responsibilities,at.the court noted that congress did not intend judicial review of a union performance to permit the court to substitute its own view of the proper bargain for that reached by the union.id.the court also observed that the approach of the court of appeals wa s particularly flawed because it fail ed to take into account either the strong policy favoring the peaceful settlement of labor disputes,or the importance of evaluating the rationality of a union decision in light of both the facts and the legal climate that confronted the negotiators at the time the decision was made.id.at.in,the union negotiators reached an agreement in the context of a bitter strike,and the supreme court determined that the settlement should be given a high level of deference.see id.at.
similarly,the sixth circuit has granted deference to a union collective bargaining decisions under the arbitrary prong of the tripartite analysis,but not the bad faith or discriminatory prongs.see ratkosky united transp.union,cir noting that unions are given broad discretion by the courts in their collective bargaining decisions because there are often a variety of legitimate options,and the courts should be careful not to substitute their judgments for those of the authorized labor organizations.ratkosky,which concerned a labor dispute involving the negotiation and establishment of a seniority system,noted that the mere fact that a seniority system in a collective bargaining agreement favors one group more than another does not in itself constitute a breach of the union duty of fair representation.id.bad faith or intentional discrimination must be shown.id.in particular,evidence of a bad faith motive or a hostile intent to discriminate against a portion of the union membership is an essential element necessary to impose a limitation on a union discretion in bargaining.see id.at quoting hardcastle greyhound lines,cir.
these cases demonstrate that a substantive examination of a union performance must be deferential under the arbitrary analysis prong,recognizing the wide latitude that negotiators require for the effective performance of their bargaining responsibilities.this deferential review,however,is no longer appropriate once allegations of bad faith or discriminatory conduct are made because such actions,if proven,would not be taken in the interest of all of the union members with good faith and honesty,nor can they be related to a union legitimate objectives.see ratkosky,at.
genuine issues of material fact 
even without deferential review of the iam conduct,qsas have failed to assert sufficient allegations of discriminatory conduct under counts i and ii,rising to the level of being intentional,severe,and unrelated to legitimate union objectives.amalgamated ass of street,ry.motor coach employees of,at.whether a bargaining representative has acted fairly,impartially,and without hostile discrimination depends on the facts of each case.balowski int l union,united,aerospace and agric.implement workers of,f d,cir.the qsas primary allegation of discriminatory conduct is that the iam created a pay scale that failed to take into account a qsa actual years of service,making it unlike the scale applicable to all other cofps members.according to the qsas,this action reflects the iam hostile and discriminatory conduct towards them.the undisputed facts,however,establish a legitimate reason for the distinction.without evidence of intentional and severe discrimination unrelated to legitimate iam objectives,this difference in treatment is an inevitable and part of the negotiation process.
in ratkosky,the court found that a union had not breached its duty of fair representation when it negotiated a bargaining agreement with a railroad for establishing seniority rights that negatively impacted a small group of railroad workers.see ratkosky,at.the court found that nothing in the record showed that the union negotiation of the system or its subsequent refusal to renegotiate the system was done in bad faith or with a hostile intent toward plaintiffs.id.the mere fact that plaintiffs were a minority group within their union organization and that they were adversely affected by the actions of the union did not establish that the union acted with hostile or discriminatory intent.id.
in contrast,in williams molpus,this court found that the plaintiffs had presented evidence from which a jury could find that the union acted in bad faith or with discriminatory intent.at.molpus involved the negotiation of a rider to a collective bargaining agreement between a parent company and its two subsidiaries.the plaintiffs put forth evidence that seniority status was rarely and the union offered contradictory reasons to support the legitimacy of endtailing the endtailing was proposed by the union itself,not demanded by the parent company the ratification of the agreement was likely based upon a misrepresentation by the union as to who had approved the agreement the union made a material misrepresentation to the plaintiffs about the party that demanded the endtail provision the agreement favored nine employees to the detriment of and one of the nine employees benefitted by the agreement was the union representative son.id.at.in the instant case,although certain qsas may have been negatively impacted by the interpretation and implementation of the pay scale in the august,bankruptcy agreement,the record lacks facts similar to molpus from which a jury could reasonably find evidence of discriminatory intent.
october,accretion agreement 
with regard to the october,accretion agreement,the qsas contend that the iam acted discriminatorily by executing the accretion agreement with northwest without a qsa vote.it is undisputed that the iam originally prepared an application for an election.on february,rather than continuing the application process,the iam requested that the qsas be accreted into the existing cofps craft or class.northwest submitted arguments to the nmb contesting this accretion.although the exact reason for the change in unionization strategy is unknown,the qsas presented no evidence that the decision was motivated by bad faith or a discriminatory intent.moreover,the final decision to accrete the qsas into the cofps craft or class,which negated the need for an election,was made by the nmb,a federal agency beyond the control of the iam.
the qsas direct the court only to minimal,inconclusive,and isolated evidence of iam hostility,none of which rises to the level of discriminatory conduct that is intentional,severe,and unrelated to legitimate union objectives.arden cody,an iam negotiator,stated in her deposition that depace referred to qsas as a bunch of whiners,said they were a lot of trouble,and that he would like to give them back to northwest.from cody deposition it appears that these were isolated comments,made after the execution of the accretion agreement,and made over the course of a period.even taking these statements as true,they still fail to support allegations of intentional and severe discriminatory conduct sufficient to support a claim for breach of duty of fair representation.
moreover,depace testified in his deposition,and the qsas offered no facts to contradict his testimony,that northwest did not want,nor was it legally obligated,to open the cofps cba prior to its expiration because doing so would be costly.during the accretion agreement negotiations from spring to fall,the union established a number to address qsa concerns and met with various qsas to discuss their concerns.in the accretion agreement,the iam was able to preserve the qsas passes until february,even though northwest had threatened to revoke the passes in prior years.additionally,the agreement established a schedule,the accrual of vacation time,protection against discipline,and a separate seniority district for qsas and bidding on schedules.
the qsas nevertheless contend that the iam acted discriminatorily by failing to define seniority or a pay scale for the qsas in the accretion agreement like other members of the cofps craft or class.it is undisputed,however,that at the time the accretion agreement was executed in,qsa salaries were based on merit increases rather than seniority.the omission of a seniority definition or pay scale therefore was not discriminatory because it was consistent with qsas prior employment history.the accretion agreement was only an interim agreement to maintain and potentially improve qsa benefits until the cofps cba opened for renegotiation in.there would have been no way for the iam to anticipate that failing to define seniority or create a pay scale in would cause a dispute in future cba negotiations that would be complicated by turmoil and northwest bankruptcy.
august,bankruptcy agreement 
with regard to the negotiation and administration of the august,bankruptcy agreement,the qsas advance three facts as supporting their discrimination claim no qsa representative was included in qsa salary negotiations qsa complaints were ignored and the creation and interpretation of the qsa pay scale was inconsistent with the historical method of applying pay scales,making qsas the only unit of iam employees whose years of service did not count toward their pay rates in the agreement.each argument is addressed in turn.
it is undisputed that a qsa was not elected to be a lead negotiator for the cofps craft or class when the cofps cba expired in despite promises in that such action would occur.although a qsa failed to be elected by the entire cofps membership,the iam permitted qsas to elect two representatives to serve as negotiation liaisons.qsas contend that the union booted the liaisons out of specific negotiation sessions during the january meetings relating to qsa pay.in response,defendants assert that only elected cofps representatives were permitted to be present during private negotiation sessions and the qsa liaisons were not the only special interest group prohibited from attending these sessions.the record contains no facts indicating that the qsa liaisons were treated differently than all other representatives.therefore,plaintiffs claim of discrimination based on the exclusion of qsa representatives from qsa salary negotiations must fail.
the qsas next assert that the iam ignored qsa complaints regarding the union representation.the record,however,does not include attachments of these complaints or any other means for determining if the complaints were meritorious and ignored in bad faith or processed differently from other union member complaints.thus the plaintiffs second assertion fails for lack of support in the record before the court.
the qsas third and primary allegation of discriminatory conduct is that the creation and interpretation of the bankruptcy agreement pay scale was inconsistent with the historical method of applying pay scales,leaving qsas as the only unit of iam employees whose years of service did not count toward their pay rates.the qsas claim that this is direct evidence that defendants acted with a discriminatory intent.the deposition testimony from roth,depace,and showers,however,supports a legitimate rationale for the differing treatment.northwest made it clear it had to receive million in labor savings or it would seek to void existing cbas in its chapter bankruptcy proceedings.the qsas argue that it is significant that the iam,not northwest,proposed the qsa pay scale,but this factor must be evaluated in the context of the entire negotiations.the fact that the iam had a degree of flexibility in achieving northwest goals and did not award qsas pay raises during bankruptcy negotiations does not establish evidence of discriminatory conduct.moreover,it is undisputed that nearly every other cofps member received a pay cut as a result of the bankruptcy negotiations.
the creation of and conversion to a pay scale reflected the need to implement an pay cut while compensating for the varied salaries caused by the qsas pay system.had the iam created a pay scale and assigned each qsa a salary based on that qsa actual years of service,it risked giving pay raises to a handful of iam employees,while the remaining iam employees incurred pay cuts.such a result could have lent itself to a discriminatory inference.additionally,not all qsas were negatively impacted by the new pay scale.qsas working for fewer years,but receiving higher pay rates due to raises,would have received a disproportionate pay reduction if the new pay scale was based solely on actual years of service.moreover,depace,the individual singled out as being most hostile toward qsas,was not responsible for the creation or interpretation of the disputed pay scales.although depace reviewed the final pay scales,the creation of the scales was assigned to thomas roth,the iam financial representative,and patrick clay,northwest financial representative.there is no evidence that depace exerted any improper influence or pressure over roth and clay while implementing the qsa pay scale.
finally,any possible misinterpretation of the proposed qsa pay scale was corrected by david driscoll february,email stating that all qsas would be subject to an pay cut.the email emphasized that it is not the case as apparently many qsas believe that an qsa who is currently making hr will go,on date of signing,to the year pay step and,in effect receive a raise no employee group is coming out of this with a pay raise.on march,qsas had an opportunity to vote on the proposed agreement along with the rest of the cofps members,and it was ratified by a vote of to.as noted in ratkosky,the mere fact that plaintiffs were a minority group within their union organization and were adversely affected by the actions of the union does not establish that the union acted with hostile or discriminatory intent.ratkosky,at.
based on these reasons,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on count i of plaintiff duty of fair representation claim regarding the negotiation and administration of the october,accretion agreement and the bankruptcy agreement.
status requests 
the qsas next contest the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on count ii regarding the processing of qsa status requests in.the qsas argue that the iam was on notice for many years that it is unlawful for unions to place arbitrary limitations on members seeking status.without identifying specific union action,the qsas allege that the iam made them jump through unlawful procedural hoops to make their march requests.
employees may be required,as a condition of their employment,to pay a fair share of the union cost of negotiating and administering a collective bargaining agreement.chicago teachers union,local hudson.at the same time,employees do have a constitutional right to prevent the union from spending a part of their required service fee to contribute to political activities unrelated to its duties as an exclusive bargaining representative.id.at.in hudson,the supreme court established three requirements for the procedures unions put in place to handle objections to fee allocations,with the intent to minimize the risk that objectors first amendment rights will be burdened.first,the procedures must minimize the risk that employees contributions might be used for impermissible
