texas follows a fair notice standard for pleading,in which courts assess the sufficiency of pleadings by determining whether an opposing party can ascertain from the pleading the nature,basic issues,and the type of evidence that might be relevant to the controversy.see.dep t of parks wildlife miranda,healthcare auld,boyles kerr,see also civ.a.however,the actual facts and evidence of a specific case limit this relatively liberal standard.chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies code requires a pleading signatory to certify that he or she conducted a reasonable inquiry into the allegations and concluded that each allegation or other factual contention in the pleading has or is likely to have evidentiary support.because the attorney who filed the petition in this case obtained and directed the review of evidence that disproved some of the allegations pled against some of the defendants,the trial court correctly found that the attorney violated chapter.however,we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in not providing a sufficient basis to support the imposition of a penalty.we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand the case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
on november,henry white was admitted to columbia north bay hospital after suffering a stroke.stephen smith treated white in the emergency room for less than one hour.robert low cared for him for four days before white was transferred to another hospital.white was comatose at the time of the transfer.he died in december.
on january,joyce white both individually and as representative of her husband henry white estate sued the alleged manufacturers,designers,and distributors of the drug known as propulsid coastal bend hospital,columbia north bay hospital,eight physicians and nurse donna mcmahon for damages flowing from henry white death.although most of the claims involved the drug propulsid,some alleged that the physicians and hospital were negligent in henry white medical treatment.
attorney thomas henry represented joyce white when he filed the petition.his office received copies of henry white medical records months before he filed the petition.henry filed a motion to withdraw as counsel on the same day he filed the petition.henry continued to represent joyce white until the trial court granted the motion to withdraw on may.
on may,smith filed a motion for sanctions against joyce white and henry for alleged violations of texas rule of civil procedure and chapters and of the texas civil practice and remedies code.low filed the same motion both physicians argued that none of the medical records from the hospital at which the physicians treated white contained any reference to either doctor having prescribed or provided propulsid to white.on june,joyce white nonsuited the case.the physicians motions for sanctions remained pending.
the trial court held a hearing on the physicians motions on july.henry did not attend or testify but appeared through counsel.on july,the trial court granted the motions and ordered henry to pay in sanctions on each motion,for a total of.on august,the trial court entered a revised judgment that incorporated findings of fact and conclusions of law.on august,henry filed a motion for new trial and a motion to vacate,modify,correct,or reform the sanctions order.on september,henry filed a supplemental motion.on october,the trial court held a hearing on henry motions.after hearing more testimony,including henry,the trial court ultimately denied admission of all additional evidence and denied henry motion to modify the judgment.henry filed a motion to reconsider,challenging the adequacy of the trial court findings of fact and conclusions of law for the first time.the trial court denied this motion and rejected as untimely all arguments not contained in the original motion for new trial and motion to vacate,modify,correct or reform the judgment as untimely.henry appealed.
an en banc court of appeals reversed,holding that because the allegations against the physicians were made in the alternative,sanctions under chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies code were inappropriate.the court also held that the physicians motions did not support sanctions under chapter for unrelated prior litigation and that the trial court order failed to meet the specificity requirements of chapter.id.at.the dissenting justices argued that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that henry waived his other complaints.id.at.the physicians petitioned this court for review.
ii.applicable law and standard of review 
we review the imposition of sanctions here under the same standard we review sanctions under rule of discretion.see am.flood research,jones,cire cummings.an appellate court may reverse the trial court ruling only if the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules and principles,such that its ruling was arbitrary or unreasonable.cire,at.to determine if the sanctions were appropriate or just,the appellate court must ensure there is a direct nexus between the improper conduct and the sanction imposed.spohn hosp.mayer,citing transamerican natural gas powell.generally,courts presume that pleadings and other papers are filed in good faith.gte commc ns.tanner.the party seeking sanctions bears the burden of overcoming this presumption of good faith.id.at.
chapters and of the texas civil practice and remedies code and rule of the texas rules of civil procedure allow a trial court to sanction an attorney or a party for filing motions or pleadings that lack a reasonable basis in fact or law.chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies code only applies in proceedings in which neither rule nor chapter applies.civ.prac.h.rule authorizes the imposition of the sanctions listed in rule b,which only provides for a monetary penalty based on expenses,court costs,or attorney fees.because the trial court ordered henry to pay in penalties not based on expenses,court costs,or attorney fees,and because the trial court written order specifically orders the penalty pursuant to chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies code,we review the trial court order in light of chapter.chapter provides that 
the signing of a pleading or motion as required by the texas rules of civil procedure constitutes a certificate by the signatory that to the signatory best knowledge,information,and belief,formed after reasonable inquiry 
the pleading or motion is not being presented for any improper purpose,including to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation 
each claim,defense,or other legal contention in the pleading or motion is warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law 
each allegation or other factual contention in the pleading or motion has evidentiary support or,for a specifically identified allegation or factual contention,is likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery and 
each denial in the pleading or motion of a factual contention is warranted on the evidence or,for a specifically identified denial,is reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.
civ.prac.under section,the signer of a pleading or motion certifies that each claim,each allegation,and each denial is based on the signatory best knowledge,information,and belief,formed after reasonable inquiry.the statute dictates that each claim and each allegation be individually evaluated for support.id.the fact that an allegation or claim is alleged against several group pleadings does not relieve the party from meeting the express requirements of chapter.each claim against each defendant must satisfy chapter.
likewise,alternative pleading under texas rule of civil procedure does not excuse noncompliance with chapter.pleading in the alternative allows multiple allegations,which may even conflict,to be alleged against a defendant,but there still must be a reasonable basis for each alternative allegation.pleading in the alternative does not permit alleging a claim with no reasonable basis in fact or law in the alternative of a claim that does have support.that is simply not permitted by texas law.see.civ.prac.each allegation and factual contention in a pleading or motion must have,or be likely to have,evidentiary support after a reasonable investigation.id.
the language of section of the texas civil practice and remedies code tracks much of the language in federal rule of civil procedure b 
representations to court.by presenting to the court whether by signing,filing,submitting,or later advocating a pleading,written motion,or other paper,an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person knowledge,information,and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,
it is not being presented for any improper purpose,such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation 
the claims,defenses,and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law 
the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or,if specifically so identified,are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery and 
the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or,if specifically so identified,are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.
although the text of rule does not specify that each claim,allegation,and denial be based on the signatory best knowledge,information,and belief,formed after reasonable inquiry,federal rule of civil procedure e,which allows pleading in the alternative,specifically subjects all such pleadings to the requirements of rule.see osborn haley,d noting that subject to rule obligations,parties may plead claims or defense sic alternately or hypothetically.neither rule nor rule permits a plaintiff to intentionally ignore relevant evidence in order to assert unfounded claims.tibor mach.
the physicians argue that by filing the pleading in this case,henry certified that to the best of his knowledge,information,and belief,the factual contentions in the pleading had or were likely to have evidentiary support.a reasonable inquiry into the allegations would have proven otherwise.see.civ.prac.white medical records,which were in henry possession before he filed the lawsuit,indicated that neither physician ever prescribed or administered the drug to white.the physicians argue that henry violated chapter by alleging that they prescribed and administered propulsid in spite of the information to the contrary in white medical records.we agree with the physicians.
undeniably,the petition focuses on propulsid,a drug used to treat gastric reflux.the first sentence of the fact section of the petition summarizes,the plaintiffs are victims of the defendants decision to manufacture,market,design,promote,distribute propulsid.the petition claims that johnson johnson,janssen pharmaceutica,and janssen research foundation were negligent,negligent per se,and strictly liable for the defective design,marketing,manufacture,and distribution of the drug and for the violation of specified statutes and regulations.the petition also includes fraud and misrepresentation claims against johnson johnson,janssen pharmaceutica,and janssen research foundation regarding the safety and efficacy of the drug.the petition further alleges that collectively the defendants breached implied and express warranties.finally,the petition makes the following sixteen allegations of negligence against the defendant physicians and hospital eight physicians and a hospital 
a.in failing to weigh the substantial risks involved in prescribing the drug against its potential benefits,if any 
b.in failing to try alternate treatments such as antacids and gastric acid reducing agents before prescribing the drug 
c.in failing to advise the plaintiffs about changes in lifestyle before prescribing the drug 
d.in failing to obtain a careful history of the plaintiffs and in prescribing the drug in the presence of underlying cardiac conditions and other conditions or family history that would preclude the use of the drug 
e.in failing to determine the plaintiffs medications and in prescribing the drug along with contraindicated medications 
f.in failing to perform ecg monitoring at baseline and in failing to refer to prior ecgs performed on the plaintiffs 
g.in failing to warn or adequately warn the plaintiffs concerning the contraindications,warnings precautions,adverse reactions,and drug interactions associated with the use f sic the drug 
h.in failing to advise the plaintiffs concerning any significant changes in the patient package inserts and physicians desk reference 
i.in failing to advise the plaintiffs concerning the contents of fda warnings and dear doctor letters 
j.in failing to advise the plaintiffs concerning the reasons for withdrawal of the drug from the market 
k.in failing to warn the plaintiffs concerning abnormal eggs sic and prolonged qtc intervals 
l.in failing to properly diagnose the cardiac conditions caused by the drug 
m.in failing to properly read and interpret the plaintiffs ecgs 
n.in failing to administer the proper treatment for the cardiac conditions caused by the drug 
o.in failing to discontinue the drug or 
p.in failing to continue to monitor the plaintiffs,including ecg monitoring,electrolyte monitoring,prescription drug monitoring,and cardiac condition monitoring.
in six a,b,c,d,e,and petition alleges that low and smith provided or prescribed the drug to white.the other paragraphs allege negligent conduct other than prescribing or providing propulsid to white.
however,low and smith presented undisputed evidence at the trial court that neither doctor ever prescribed or administered propulsid to white and that a review of white medical records would have confirmed that fact.low filed an affidavit with his motion for sanctions swearing that a t no time during his involvement with this patient did he ever prescribe,provide,administer or order propulsid for white.smith filed an affidavit making the same statement with his motion.at the july,hearing on the motions,the physicians again testified that they did not administer or prescribe propulsid.the testimony established that smith was white doctor for less than an hour in the emergency room,and low,an internal medicine doctor at columbia north bay,provided care to white for four days after he arrived at columbia north bay and before his transfer to a facility in corpus christi.low also confirmed that anyone familiar with reviewing a medical record could easily have confirmed low testimony and the fact that low had nothing to do with propulsid had they simply reviewed the record.smith testified that white medical record contains no reference to smith ever prescribing or administering propulsid to white.in fact,henry does not dispute low testimony that white had not been taking propulsid approximately two weeks before his treatment by the physicians.smith similarly testified that he was informed that white had not been taking propulsid for some time before his arrival at the columbia north bay emergency room and his subsequent treatment by low and smith.
the evidence at the hearing supports the trial court conclusion that 
based upon the totality of the evidence admitted during the hearing on the motions for sanctions,each and all of the allegations brought against low and smith,and therefore the lawsuit brought against these physicians,did not,on january,and do not now,have evidentiary support nor were they on january,likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation 
under chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies code,the physicians were not required to specifically show bad faith or malicious intent,just that henry certified he made a reasonable inquiry into all of the allegations when he did not and that he certified that all the allegations in the petition had evidentiary support,or were likely
