peter cefalu was terminated from his position as a truck driver with roadway express,roadway on february.that happened to be the same day on which he provided testimony in support of a fellow employee grievance hearing against roadway.on august,cefalu filed a complaint with the occupational safety and health administration osha,an agency within the department of labor dol,alleging that he had been fired in retaliation for his support of his in the grievance hearing and that this activity was protected under the surface transportation assistance act of staa.
roadway responded that cefalu termination had nothing to do with his testimony.instead,the company asserted,he was fired because he had lied on his employment application when he failed to report previous serious truck driving accidents and the fact that he had lost his earlier job after those accidents.for reasons that are unclear,however,roadway refused to comply with discovery orders in the dol proceedings one of the orders it flouted asked who first alerted the company to cefalu driving history.as a sanction,the dol administrative law judge alj ruled that roadway could not present evidence that it had learned from its undisclosed informant.this sanction prevented roadway from defending the termination of cefalu by using his driving record.the administrative review board approved the alj ultimate decision in cefalu favor.in its petition to this court,roadway contests the discovery sanction as well as the substantive ruling in cefalu favor.
in,congress enacted the staa to combat the increasing number of deaths,injuries and property damage resulting from commercial trucking accidents.brock roadway express,d quoting cong.rec.one measure the statute adopted to further its goals was a provision forbidding an employer from discharging or discriminating against an employee for taking actions such as filing a complaint or testifying in a proceeding that point out an employer safety violations.a.
cefalu worked as a commercial truck driver for roadway from november,to february.he belonged to teamsters local,as did jonathan gomaz,another roadway driver.after roadway discharged gomaz for allegedly falsifying his driving log,gomaz filed a grievance.in the ensuing proceedings,cefalu provided a written,notarized statement asserting that a roadway supervisor had asked cefalu to falsify his driving log.the grievance panel reinstated gomaz.
thomas forrest,roadway manager for labor relations,attended the grievance hearing.after it was over,he telephoned robert schauer,the assistant terminal manager at roadway milwaukee facility,to inform him of the reinstatement.forrest claimed that he did not tell schauer about cefalu statements.later that same afternoon,february,however,schauer participated in a conference call with phillip stanoch,roadway for labor relations,and mike jones,roadway relay manager.after the call,jones called in a union representative,telephoned cefalu,and then fired cefalu for falsifying his employment application.cefalu filed a complaint with osha on august,alleging that roadway had violated the staa when it discharged him.after osha dismissed his complaint for lack of merit,cefalu appealed and his case was assigned to an alj.
at that point,cefalu served interrogatories on roadway,including one asking the company to identify all persons who provided information relevant to his discharge.roadway refused to furnish the name of the confidential source who first informed the company about cefalu driving record.roadway claimed that revealing its source would put the informant at risk of retaliation and hurt its business operations.the alj rejected this argument and granted cefalu motion to compel the information.the judge noted that roadway had not invoked any recognized privilege for withholding the information,and that it had even acknowledged that its stance warranted a sanction.cefalu requested an entry of default judgment,but the alj instead chose the lesser sanction of precluding roadway from presenting any evidence that arose from the confidential source.
as a practical matter,this sanction spelled the end to roadway defense,since roadway had no other independent evidence indicating that the termination was not retaliatory.the alj therefore concluded that cefalu had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he was fired for engaging in the protected activity of providing testimony at the gomaz grievance hearing.the board affirmed the alj decision.
roadway has petitioned for review of the board order requiring reinstatement an automatic remedy for an staa violation,back pay,and attorney fees and expenses for cefalu.it argues first that the alj deprived it of its fundamental right to due process by imposing the evidentiary sanction on the merits,it argues that cefalu discharge did not violate the staa and finally,it urges that it would violate public policy to reinstate cefalu.
we find it preferable first to take up roadway argument that cefalu failed to make out a prima facie case that the company discharge of cefalu violated the staa.if this were correct,we would not need to evaluate the discovery sanction imposed on roadway because its effect did not come into play until the point at which roadway was obliged to offer a legitimate reason for the adverse action against the employee.
this circuit allows a wide variety of retaliation claims to be approached for purposes of summary judgment motions either through a direct or an indirect approach.rogers city of chicago,cir.the parties seem confused about which was used here,but the dispute is beside the point.in this case,as in any in which the decisionmaker ruled on the ultimate question,the taxonomy loses its importance.we review the method that the alj seems to have used only to highlight the questions he was asking.it was similar to the familiar one launched by mcdonnell douglas green,d.the employee has the initial burden of showing that he engaged in protected activity under the staa that he was the subject of adverse employment action and that there was a causal link between his protected activity and the adverse action of his employer.moon transport drivers,cir.once he has done so,the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employee rejection.then the employee has an opportunity to show that the employer stated reason for the adverse action was pretextual and that intentional discrimination was at work.buie,cir.in retaliation cases,this court has observed that t he fact that the defendant may be able to produce evidence that the plaintiff was fired for a lawful reason just creates an issue of fact what was the true cause of the discharge.stone city of indianapolis,cir.
but,as we said earlier,the tests are normally used to decide whether summary judgment is proper.here,the alj reached a final decision on the merits of cefalu claim.we thus look at the various steps along the way to the judge result only for whatever light they throw on the ultimate conclusion.
roadway contends that the gomaz hearing was not an activity protected under the staa because it was not a proceeding relating to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety rule,regulation,standard,or order.a staa.roadway is therefore arguing that the alleged falsification of driving logs,the misconduct gomaz had allegedly committed,is unrelated to vehicle safety.dol sees matters differently it takes the position that driving logs serve important safety purposes of ascertaining whether a driver has reached his maximum hours.
even apart from any deference we might owe to the department views,dol has the better of this argument.at least two of our fellow circuits have characterized driving logs as a measure of safety compliance,and rules as safety regulations.see united states anderson,cir labeling an incomplete driving log as a violation of a safety regulation darrell andrews trucking,fed.motor carrier safety,identifying the underlying purpose of mandatory driving logs as ensur ing that truck drivers are awake and alert on the road.the same message is conveyed by the applicable transportation regulations,which desc
