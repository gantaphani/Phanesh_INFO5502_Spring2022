we are presented with a variation on the riddle of the tree that falls in the forest when there is no one around to hear it it is well settled that in opposing a slapp motion the plaintiff must show a probability of prevailing on his cause of action and the showing must be based on admissible evidence this appeal poses the question if the plaintiff submits in admissible evidence but no one objects to it is the evidence admissible for purposes of showing a probability of success on the merits in light of the principle that evidentiary objections are waived if not properly made and the policy and procedures underlying california statute we conclude the evidence can be considered in determining whether the plaintiff met his burden of proof.for this and other reasons discussed below we affirm the trial court order denying the defendant slapp motion.
facts and proceedings below 
this case arises from a controversy over who should be the beneficiary of the trust of anne petone,a widow with a estate.
in petone placed most of her assets in a living trust.several individuals and charities were named as beneficiaries.petone named ann connell,a neighbor,as the beneficiary of a certificate of deposit in the amount of.several years later petone asked her pastor,father patrick gallagher,a roman catholic priest,to assist her with her financial affairs.gallagher did so.his evidence shows he collected petone rental income and placed it in her bank account and hired a professional management company to manage her rental property.in addition gallagher frequently visited petone to make sure her personal needs were being met.he made sure she had enough to eat,caused necessary repairs to be made on her home and,when he went on vacations,he arranged for his sister,a nun,to stay with petone and look after her.
after gallagher had been assisting petone with her personal and business affairs for approximately a year and a half,petone made a significant change in her trust,bequeathing the bulk of her estate to gallagher and naming him the successor trustee of her trust.connell ceased to be a beneficiary of the trust.
in two individuals,jean wren and jean wren,filed petitions on behalf of petone seeking among other things to have the court appoint them conservators of petone person and estate,to remove gallagher as successor trustee of the petone trust and to have the amended trust declared invalid.how the wrens became involved in petone affairs is not clear from the record but is not relevant to the issues before us.the wrens petitions alleged petone friends and neighbors were concerned for her well being.as examples of the bases for this concern the petitions alleged gallagher had isolated petone,failed to provide her sufficient money for food and other routine needs and had not used the assets of her trust for her maintenance and support.
connell and several other neighbors attended the first hearing on the wrens petitions.the next day the daily breeze newspaper published an article about the controversy over petone conservatorship.the article quoted connell as stating,with reference to gallagher,we thought he was there to help her,but he was there to help himself.
gallagher sued connell for slander,libel and other torts connell moved to strike the complaint under the statute the trial court denied the motion and connell filed a timely appeal 
discussion 
the parties agree for purposes of the slapp motion connell alleged statement arose from constitutionally protected activity.thus the only issue is whether the trial court was correct in concluding gallagher established a reasonable probability of success on the merits of his slander claim to establish such a probability,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.our review of this issue is de novo 
connell contends gallagher failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability of success on the merits because he did not make a sufficient showing connell made the statement attributed to her the statement was one of fact as opposed to opinion connell made the statement with malice and the statement is false.we address each of these contentions below 
connell did not raise a hearsay objection to the evidence she made the allegedly defamatory statement.therefore the trial court could properly consider such evidence in determining gallagher probability of success on the merits.
the plaintiff first task in a slander suit is to show the defendant made the allegedly defamatory statement.the only evidence gallagher presented on this issue was a copy of the daily breeze article containing the allegedly defamatory statement and attributing the statement to connell.
when offered in this context the newspaper article is hearsay because it is an statement by the reporter offered to prove connell made the remark attributed to her in the article.no exception to the hearsay rule is applicable to this statement.therefore,the statement is not admissible evidence connell,however,did not object to the article on the ground it is hearsay.she objected on the grounds the article was no t admissible and lack s authentication.in her brief on appeal she argues the article was not competent admissible evidence.
thus we are faced with this question does the plaintiff meet the requirement of showing a probability of success on the merits if he bases his probability of success on evidence which is inadmissible but not properly objected to 
we explored the statute requirement in detail in fashion.there we explained 
it is well settled that in opposing a slapp motion the plaintiff showing of a probability of prevailing on its claim must be based on admissible evidence.in wilcox superior court we held the requirement of establishing a probability of success means the plaintiff must demonstrate the complaint is legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citation.we went on to explain this test implicitly assumes the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff is admissible,otherwise there would be nothing for the trier of fact to credit.citation.in roberts los angeles county bar th,d we held in order to demonstrate a probability of success a plaintiff must adduce competent admissible evidence.citation.our supreme court has not spoken directly on this issue.however,in construing a statute which it described as closely related to the slapp statute,the court held a plaintiff seeking punitive damages against certain health care providers must demonstrate that he possesses a legally sufficient claim which is substantiated,that is,supported by competent,admissible evidence.citation.
we went on to distinguish evidence which is substantively inadmissible from evidence which is only inadmissible because it fails to meet some collateral requirement for admissibility such as authentication.we observed 
t he proper view of admissible evidence for purposes of the slapp statute is evidence which,by its nature,is capable of being admitted at trial,evidence which is competent,relevant and not barred by a substantive rule.courts have thus excluded evidence which would be barred at trial by the hearsay rule,citation or because it is speculative,not based on personal knowledge or consists of impermissible opinion testimony.citation.this type of evidence can not be used by the plaintiff to establish a probability of success on the merits because it could never be introduced at trial.on a slapp motion a n assessment of the probability of prevailing on the claim looks to trial,and the evidence that will be presented at that time.citation.
at first it would appear that under our decisions in fashion and wilcox superior court,we should hold gallagher failed to establish a probability of success on the merits of his slander cause of action.his probability of success depends at least in part on evidence which suffers from an incurable substantive of the hearsay therefore could never be introduced at trial.furthermore,in wilcox we rejected the argument the plaintiff can satisfy its burden of proof merely by demonstrating the existence of sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case and need not actually produce such evidence at the hearing on the motion 
but the present case is different from fashion,wilcox and other cases which have held the plaintiff could not establish a probability of success by relying on inadmissible evidence.in those cases,the defendants lodged proper objections to the inadmissible evidence in the present case,the defendant did not.evidence code section provides the admission of inadmissible evidence is harmless error unless t here appears of record an objection to or a motion to strike the evidence that was timely made and so stated as to make clear the specific ground of the objection or motion.
it has long been the rule an objection the evidence is not admissible or not competent is too general to include the objection it calls for hearsay therefore,in the case before us the hearsay objection was waived in the trial court and on appeal.under another rule,incompetent hearsay admitted without objection is sufficient to sustain a finding or judgment.the reporter attribution of the allegedly defamatory statement to connell was admitted without objection.it is direct evidence connell made the statement and thus it is sufficient to sustain a finding of a reasonable probability gallagher can satisfy the first element of his slander cause of action.
we recognize an argument could be made a court,in ruling on a slapp motion,should determine the admissibility of the plaintiff proffered evidence if the defendant at least raises the issue of admissibility even if he or she has not composed a technically sufficient objection.allowing the plaintiff to defeat a slapp motion with evidence which supports the plaintiff cause of action but which would be inadmissible at trial defeats the purpose of the statute to provide a fast and inexpensive unmasking and dismissal of meritless lawsuits in the present case for example it is highly unlikely connell counsel,after reading this opinion,would miss another opportunity to object to the newspaper article on the ground of hearsay.until that opportunity arises,however,this lawsuit will continue to hang over connell head and she will continue to incur legal fees and costs in defending against it.
we do not find this argument persuasive.we do not quarrel with the proposition the legislature intended to prevent slapps by ending them early and without great cost to the slapp target.but the legislature also intended to avoid jeopardizing meritorious lawsuits.requiring the defendant to clearly state the specific ground of her objection to the plaintiff evidence maintains this balance between the interests of the defendant and the plaintiff.if connell had objected to the newspaper article as hearsay when offered to prove she made the statement attributed to her,gallagher would have had the opportunity to cure the defect in his evidence.he could have obtained a declaration from the reporter or another witness testifying connell made the statement.alternatively he could have asked the trial court to continue the hearing on the motion and lift the stay on discovery so he could take the reporter deposition if gallagher cured the defect with nonobjectionable evidence the trial court could proceed to determine other issues raised in the motion.if,however,gallagher did not cure the defect after having been given the opportunity to do so,the trial court could properly grant the defendant motion and strike the complaint.we also observe it is entirely possible if not probable gallagher will introduce the reporter testimony at trial,or at least other evidence proving connell indeed did make these statements during her interview for the newspaper article.in other words,this is not the sort of evidentiary problem a plaintiff will be incapable of curing by the time of trial.
for these reasons we conclude the trial court properly considered the newspaper article as evidence connell made the allegedly defamatory statement and this evidence established a reasonable probability gallagher could satisfy his burden of proving connell made the statement.
ii.under the circumstances of this case a reasonable trier of fact could find the statement he came to help himself to be defamatory.
connell argues even if gallagher could show she made the statement attributed to her in the article that statement was not defamatory as a matter of law.rather,the statement was an expression of opinion or hyperbole uttered in the heat of the court proceedings involving gallagher and her friend and neighbor,petone.we reject this argument and conclude a reasonable trier of fact could find the statement defamatory 
a reasonable person reading the statement at issue in the context of the entire article would conclude the speaker is stating gallagher pretended he was interested in helping petone but his real interest was in getting his hands on her money if this is a false statement of fact it is slander.clearly the statement would injure gallagher in respect to his occupation as a priest because it reflects adversely on his moral behavior,his trustworthiness and his commitment to the welfare of the members of his flock 
the essential difference between a statement of fact and a statement of opinion is that a statement of fact implies a provably false factual assertion while a statement of opinion does not for example,the daily breeze article quotes the petition for conservatorship as stating gallagher is extremely rude when petone friends come to visit.this statement is not defamatory because it does not make a factual assertion capable of being proven true or false.whether someone is extremely rude is a subjective judgment of the person making the statement in contrast it has been held a statement the members of a priestly society,placed the property belonging to the society in their own names might well be construed as an assertion of fact,rather than opinion and is susceptible of a libelous meaning.the court reached this conclusion despite acknowledging the statement was made in the context of a highly charged and theological debate.
in the case before us,the assertion gallagher was not there to help petone but he was there to help himself,implying deceit,chicanery,fraud and undue influence on gallagher part,is capable of being proven true or false.relevant evidence could include the increase or decrease in petone care and maintenance after gallagher became involved in her life the improvement or deterioration in petone financial affairs whether gallagher was aware petone intended to make him the sole beneficiary of her trust the extent to which gallagher actively participated in bringing about the changes in the trust benefiting him petone mental and physical condition at the time she made the changes and whether petone past involvement with the church was such that the church or one of its priests would be a normal object of petone bounty.
we thus conclude it is reasonably probable a trier of fact would find the statement at issue a defamatory statement of fact.
iii.gallagher was not a public figure and therefore does not have to show connell acted with malice in making the statement at issue.
we reject connell claim gallagher was a public figure and therefore had to establish he could prove she made the statement at issue with actual malice 
gallagher declaration states he is a priest and the pastor of mary star of the sea parish in san pedro.mary star is one of three catholic parishes in the san pedro community.when gallagher first came to mary star approximately years ago the local newspaper ran a small human interest article about him.he states he may have been mentioned in a newspaper story about a pregnant student a few years ago.other than that,gallagher declared,he has not been the subject of media attention until the daily breeze article which is the subject of this lawsuit.he also states he has not been involved in local politics or civic affairs.
