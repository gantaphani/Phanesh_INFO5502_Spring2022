background 
on june,plaintiff joan schmude filed suit in the circuit court of cook county,illinois,against cook county sheriff michael sheahan,claiming that he was liable under and various state law theories for the death of her husband,louis schmude,while he was in the sheriff custody.two days later,three sheriff spatz,patricia pultz,and lawrence indicted and charged with murder in connection with schmude death.schmude amended her complaint to name the three sheriff deputies.on july,the sheriff removed the case to federal court.
on december,attorneys theobald and brunell filed appearances in federal court.theobald also filed a motion with the district court for appointment as special state attorney under.comp.stat.to represent defendant spatz in the civil case brunell filed a similar motion with respect to defendant koscianski.several days later,attorney ficaro filed an appearance and a motion to be appointed to represent defendant pultz.the motions were taken under advisement.on december,the court ordered a stay of all proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal prosecution.in connection with the stay,the district court struck the three aforementioned with a motion theobald had made to remand the case to state case control purposes.the court allowed for reinstatement of the motions within days of the lifting of the stay order.
the criminal case concluded on march.directly thereafter,attorney theobald filed another motion with the district court to remand the civil case to state court.at the march,hearing on the motion,the district judge stated that before he lifted the stay and ruled on theobald motion to remand,he wanted to determine who would represent the defendants in the case.he explained that he had concerns about appointing theobald,brunell,and ficaro as special state attorneys,since their prior experience with the state attorneys office could,in his opinion,create a conflict of interest.the attorneys responded that they were not presently seeking appointment as special state attorneys and urged the court to decide the remand motion instead.the district judge asked if that meant they were withdrawing their motions to be appointed special state attorneys.the attorneys indicated that if there were motions for appointment pending,they were withdrawing them.the district court then vacated the stay.
on april,the district court denied the motion to remand the case to state court.on april,attorneys theobald,brunell,ficaro,and pinelli filed petitions in the circuit court of cook county,seeking appointment as special state attorneys in the federal action.the petition also sought the appointment of pinelli as additional counsel for defendant pultz.the attorneys stated in their petition that the underlying case had been removed to federal court,but they did not disclose to the state court their previous discussion with the district judge about appointments.on may,the state court granted their motion.the state court order indicated that it retained jurisdiction over the appointments for the purposes of awarding the above special state attorneys expenses and attorney fees on a regular basis.
attorneys theobald and brunell periodically sought and obtained fees in the state court during the year that followed.they never discussed their appointments with the district court,though they did advert to the matter in passing.for example,at a hearing held on march,theobald told the district judge,i am a special state attorney,and so is brunell.theobald made other similar statements at hearings held on april,and may.
it was over a year before the issue of appointments was fully discussed again in the district court.on may,the court held a hearing on attorney ficaro motion to withdraw as counsel,during which the judge asked who would replace him.attorney pinelli responded that he would take over defendant pultz representation and explained that he had already filed an appearance as.the judge asked pinelli if he was pultz private attorney.pinelli responded,no,he had been appointed by the state court.the judge was surprised to hear that and stated that counsel were not permitted to pursue any proceedings related to appointment as special state attorneys in state court 
you are not special attorneys appointed in this case.once this case was removed,it was removed,and no attorney,once removed,could go before any state judge and file a motion.and any order that would be entered under those circumstances would be an improper order and unenforceable.once the case is removed,just this court makes the decisions if you are here,it is because you are employed by individuals.
theobald,speaking on his own behalf and that of the other attorneys,revealed that the state court had appointed all of them the judge responded,y ou can be here as private attorneys.but you are not special state attorneys as far as this court is concerned.the judge then asked pinelli whether he would be proceeding as pultz private attorney.pinelli answered that he needed time to consider what he had heard,to which the judge responded well,you are here only as private counsel.the judge characterized his view as an order.
several months passed before the issue of appointments arose again.in september,the parties reached a settlement.the district judge shortly thereafter learned that the attorneys had continued to obtain attorney fees from the state court,despite his warning that such conduct was improper.on october,the court notified the attorneys that it planned to proceed on a rule to show cause as to why it should not impose sanctions.on october,the court issued the rule,stating for its basis counsel disregard of court orders,improper actions in returning to state court for appointment and fees after removal,and violation of their duty of candor.the underlying case was dismissed on october,but proceedings concerning the court rule continued.
the attorneys responded to the rule by filing motions,answers,and other pleadings,including a motion to recuse the judge from the case.the district court denied the attorneys motions and found their conduct sanctionable.on may,the court issued its final judgment imposing sanctions on the attorneys.each counsel was ordered to disgorge all of the fees he had received.accordingly,theobald was ordered to disgorge,brunell was ordered to disgorge,and pinelli was ordered to disgorge.the court also observed that theobald had sought in state court to have a special state attorney appointed to defend him in the sanctions proceedings,and enjoined all three counsel from seeking attorney fees or receiving remuneration from cook county for their representation of their clients in this case or for defending against the rule to show cause and resultant proceedings.finally,each counsel was ordered to pay a fine directly to the court.the attorneys timely appealed the court may order.
ii.discussion 
the appellants argue that the district court improperly invoked its inherent power to impose sanctions.amicus curiae appointed to represent the district court maintains that the court sanctions were valid for primarily two reasons.first,amicus contends that counsel were never properly appointed special state attorneys because removal of the case to federal court had stripped the state court of jurisdiction.second,amicus claims that even if the district court was wrong about the propriety of the state court appointments,its sanctions were appropriate nonetheless in light of counsel conduct.
the supreme court has recognized that all courts are vested with an inherent power to impose silence,respect,and decorum,in their presence,and submission to their lawful mandates.chambers nasco,d see also dale
