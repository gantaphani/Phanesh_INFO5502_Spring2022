it is a general rule that,outside of a contempt proceeding,trial courts lack inherent power to impose a monetary sanction against an attorney for misconduct in court.the authority to impose such a sanction must be found in a statute.this has been the declared law in california for at least the past years.see bauguess paine cal d.we apply it here in the context of a monetary fine levied against a prosecutor for exercising jury peremptory challenges in violation of the constitutional principles laid down in people wheeler cal d,and other cases.
in this case,the court found that the prosecutor had improperly exercised peremptory challenges,leading to a mistrial and dismissal of the venire panel.acting under code of civil procedure section,the court assessed a sanction against her.all statutory references are to the code of civil procedure unless otherwise stated.the people and the prosecutor seek appellate review of the finding and the order.we find sufficient support in the record for the finding.but it is a requisite to application of the statute that a court order be violated,and we find no such court order in this case.since the statute does not apply and the trial court lacks inherent power to impose the fine,the order imposing it must be reversed.
procedural and factual summary 
the defendant was charged with murder.the present appeal arises out of her third trial,the first two having ended in mistrial due to the jury inability to reach a verdict.
following the court voir dire of prospective jurors,the court discussed attorney voir dire at sidebar.the court made it clear that it would only allow questions going to a challenge for cause.on that basis,it rejected defense counsel request to ask prospective jurors how they would evaluate testimony,although the court indicated that it would allow questions as to whether they would apply the same standard to all witnesses.the prosecutor said she wanted to ask questions about employment,but acknowledged that not generally cause.the court agreed that it was not,and the prosecutor said she had no questions related to cause.the trial court admonished both sides to keep their voir dire tight.
the attorneys then proceeded to exercise peremptory challenges to prospective jurors and to briefly ask questions of prospective jurors seated in place of those who had been excused.when the prosecutor had excused nine prospective jurors,defense counsel presented a wheeler challenge,arguing that the prosecutor had engaged in a systematic exclusion of prospective jurors based on ethnicity.addressing the prosecutor,the court stated indeed,there been appears to be a systematic exclusion of minorities by you.the court recounted the challenges she had made.a white male was understandably excluded because he had indicated a dislike of lawyers.the balance was made up of two asians three one hispanic a female caucasian and one person whose ethnicity was difficult to categorize.the court concluded,i think you have some explaining to do.
the court effectively having found a prima facie showing of prohibited group bias see people turner cal d,fn,trial court inquiry,on complaint by defense counsel,implies finding of group discrimination,shifting burden of justification to prosecutor,the prosecutor proceeded to explain her strikes.the asians,she said,each had exhibited difficulty with the english language.the court agreed with respect to one of them i can accept that.for several of the other ethnic minority prospective jurors,the explanation was that the trial would involve technical evidence,especially from the coroner,and,based on their occupations,the prosecutor did not believe the prospective jurors were up to understanding the case.one was a janitor or a tailor,two others were janitors and one a custodian,which was the reason for excusing her.another prospective juror,a hispanic female,was a clerk with a public health agency,and the prosecutor could only assume as a county employee she much like our clerks,she basically a filing individual.based on that,again,i did believe she could comprehend the testimony.still another dismissed prospective juror,a female,was a customer service representative,they the individuals that you call when you want your phone company service based on technical,but a background in whether or not they could comprehend the testimony,i just base on a calculated assumption or guess as to what their level of comprehension going to be.
the trial court found a clear violation of the wheeler statute.none of these reasons do i find a convincing reason for excusing them.the court asked defense counsel what he wanted to do.counsel moved for a mistrial.the court granted the motion.after dismissing the remaining members of the venire,the court addressed the prosecutor i find what you have done is not only illegal,but immoral and unethical,lopez.what sanctions should i impose my inclination is to impose sanctions in terms of monetary sanctions in the amount of pursuant to section.my further inclination is to deny you the right to use peremptory challenges during jury selection tomorrow.the court responded to the prosecutor statement that defense counsel had used all of his peremptories against white prospective jurors with the observation that it was defense counsel who laid the challenge,and i listened to your reasons and your reasons were simply unacceptable,they not credible reasons for excusing the people that you excused.the prosecutor asked the court to note that there were prospective jurors with clearly english comprehension difficulties.the court agreed that was the case with respect to a couple of them,but you kicking off a perfectly capable confident and intelligent woman in your last peremptory,juror,your peremptory and some of the other reasons simply do quash sic wash.the technicalities of your case are so technical that these people could listen to the case and i do buy it.
the court issued an order to show cause why the prosecutor should not be sanctioned under section and,after further colloquy,set the hearing for the following day.
on that day the prosecutor was present together with another deputy district attorney,who appeared on her behalf.that deputy argued that section does not apply to an advocacy situation such as jury selection,that there had been no warning from the trial court that the prosecutor conduct might be sanctionable,nor had she violated a court order.counsel also disputed whether a wheeler violation had occurred at all.he concluded with a suggestion that the court treat the entire matter as a warning and proceed with the case.the trial court declined to do that,and ordered that the sanction stand in the amount of,which it stayed.
there was no fourth trial.on the following day,following appropriate waivers,the defendant entered a guilty plea to the amended charge of voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to state prison.the people filed an appeal from the sanction order.the appeal shows the prosecutor both as appellant and real party in interest.the people also sought our intervention by writ to overturn the sanction order.we denied the petition because the people had an adequate remedy at law through its pending appeal.
discussion 
the appeal is authorized by section,subdivision b,which permits an appeal after final judgment from a sanction order where the amount is less than.
technically,the respondent in the case,if there is one,is the defendant,sarina lenee muhammad.having accepted a plea bargain and having been sentenced accordingly,she obviously has no interest in the present dispute,and has not made an appearance on appeal.we are in receipt of a respondent brief filed on behalf of the superior court.since the briefing did not raise an issue about the authority of the trial court to participate as a party in the appeal,we sent a government code section letter to counsel,inviting them to advise the court by letter brief of their position with respect to whether the superior court could appear,brief,and argue as respondent in the case and,if not,what procedure we should follow.
the superior court letter in response argues that this is the unusual case in which the trial court itself has sufficient standing and interest to appear as a party on appeal.in their response,the people agree that the trial court is entitled to recognition as a party.
the superior court letter cites a number of cases in which trial courts have appeared as a responding party in an appellate review of a sanction order.the cited cases are kane hurley th,d people tabb d.bergman rifkind sterling,d.caldwell samuels jewelers d.and seykora superior court d.the observation is correct,although none of these cases discussed the propriety of the trial court participation.one seykora was a writ proceeding,and in another caldwell,the opinion simply noted an argument of the county counsel representing the trial court.caldwell,at,fn.
as a general rule,the role of a trial court is to decide cases,not to participate as a litigant in their resolution.the latter role is for the parties,not the court.see discussion in municipal court superior court gonzalez cal th,d.nevertheless,there are rare and limited situations in which the trial court itself may participate in the appellate process.see discussion in ng superior court th,d,disapproved in part in curle superior court cal th,fn,d,disapproving anything in ng in conflict with the supreme court ruling on the issue of whether a judge,disqualified in code of civil procedure section proceedings,may participate as a party in an appellate review of the disqualification james superior court th,d and cases collected in justice kennard dissent in gonzalez,supra,cal th at,d.we note that even in these rare cases,the judge is not a proper party on appeal curle superior court,supra,cal th,d,and that there is authority that the trial court may only defend itself in a writ proceeding,rather than initiate such a proceeding.james superior court,supra,th at,d curle,at fn,d.
these unusual exceptions typically occur when a question is presented involving important issues about the trial court authority to control proceedings before it,which none of the litigating parties has an interest in pursuing.see ng.superior court,supra,th at,d.
that fits this case.as we have discussed,the defendant has no interest in whether the trial court was correct in imposing a monetary sanction against the prosecutor.and the county of los angeles,to which the sanction was payable,has not sought to intervene in any capacity.the trial court,as a court,has a legitimate interest in its authority to impose a monetary sanction against an attorney for courtroom misconduct.no one other than the court has any interest in defending the court position.
nevertheless,the trial court is not and can not be a party in a direct appeal from a case it has tried.the few cases that have treated the question have allowed the court to participate in writ proceedings in which the court is named albeit nominally in most cases as the respondent.that is not our case,and we decline to convert this appeal into a writ proceeding at this point.
there is an alternative,suggested by the trial court in its letter responding to our request for briefing on this issue.it is that we treat the trial court responding brief as a brief amicus curiae.the court briefing has been helpful in our analysis of the issues,and we believe this to be a proper request.see grant superior court th,fn,d,where this was done.we shall proceed on that basis.
we granted the request of the los angeles county public defender to file a brief amicus curiae.it has done so,arguing that the sanction order should be reversed.
the rule of the wheeler case is that the use of peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors on the sole ground of group bias violates the right to trial by a jury drawn from a representative of the community under article i,section of the california constitution.people wheeler,supra,cal d at.the federal rule is the same,although based on the equal protection clause.batson kentucky,d people burgener cal th,d.these cases have been followed and applied by hundreds of others,and the rule they announce is among the best known principles of trial court procedure.while peremptory challenges based on group bias are unconstitutional,challenges on virtually any other bona fide ground are permissible.t he law recognizes that a peremptory challenge may be predicated on a broad spectrum of evidence suggestive of juror partiality.the evidence may range from the obviously serious to the apparently trivial,from the virtually certain to the highly speculative.people wheeler,supra,cal d at.
if a party brings a wheeler challenge,raising the issue of whether one or more jury peremptories by another side was exercised on the basis of group bias,and the trial court explicitly or implicitly finds that the challenging party has made a prima facie showing of that impropriety,the burden shifts to the other side to justify its strikes.it is then up to the trial judge to decide whether the reason offered is truth or pretext.s uch a ruling requires trial judges to make difficult and often close judgments.they are in a good position to make such determinations,however,on the basis of their knowledge of local conditions and of local prosecutors.citation.they are also well situated to bring to bear on this question their powers of observation,their understanding of trial techniques,and their broad judicial experience.we are confident of their ability to distinguish a true case of group discrimination by peremptory challenges from a spurious claim interposed simply for purposes of harassment or delay.people wheeler,supra,cal d at.
a few years after wheeler was decided,the supreme court overturned a trial court ruling denying a wheeler challenge,in part because it rejected the prosecutor explanation that some challenges were based on the prospective juror body language and mode of answering certain questions.people trevino cal d.justice kaus filed an eloquent dissent.he noted his own hunch that what is really behind the majority rejection of hunches,and body language is a fear that prosecutors will insincerely attempt to justify group bias with such reasons and that trial judges,some of whom are perceived as being unsympathetic toward the wheeler rule,will their explanations.i submit that if we can not trust trial courts to do their job fairly,we might as well close up shop and that we,ourselves,were insincere when,in wheeler,we professed our faith in the good judgment of the trial bench.trevino,at,fn.
this passage from justice kaus dissent was quoted with approval in people johnson cal d,which overruled trevino as extending wheeler beyond its logical limits.it guides our discussion here.
these decisions and others tell us that the trial court judgment is entitled to considerable deference.this is especially true when the bench officer is an experienced trial judge.thus,in johnson,the court noted that when that case was tried,the judge had almost years of judicial experience in supervising jury trials,and that trial judges know the local prosecutors assigned to their courts and are in a better position than appellate courts to evaluate the credibility and the genuineness of reasons given for peremptory challenges.people johnson,supra,cal d at,fn.we take judicial notice that,when this case was tried,the trial judge had over years of trial experience,and years of experience before that as a prosecutor.see bogen,cal.courts and judges ed.
the trial judge listened to the prosecutor explanations for her peremptory challenges.he agreed that two of them were justified by her explanations.the prospective juror who had demonstrated a dislike of attorneys,and one who had particular difficulty with the english language.but he rejected her explanations that ethnic minority prospective jurors she challenged were not up to understanding the case to be tried.as a general proposition,an honestly held belief that a prospective juror will be unable to understand the case is a legitimate basis for a peremptory challenge.and a prosecutor peremptory challenges are presumed to be exercised in a constitutional manner.people turner cal th,d.but the presumption is rebutable the trial judge implicitly found that it was rebutt
