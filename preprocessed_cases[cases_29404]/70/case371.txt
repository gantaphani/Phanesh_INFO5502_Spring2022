the appellant has been subpoenaed as a witness before the april special grand jury hereafter the special grand jury and has refused to answer any questions beyond his name,address and occupation.the government petitioned the district court to hold the appellant in contempt and the appellant moved to quash the subpoena.the district court granted the petition for contempt and effectively denied the motion to quash after the appellant persisted in his refusal to comply with the subpoena following a grant of use immunity pursuant to.the appellant is currently incarcerated pursuant to the district court civil contempt order.under that order,he will remain incarcerated until he complies with the subpoena,or the special grand jury expires,or the district court determines that continued confinement would not coerce him to testify and would instead become punitive the appellant timely filed a notice of appeal,and we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to b,the recalcitrant witness statute 
this is not the first time the appellant finds himself in civil contempt for refusing to comply with a subpoena.five years ago in a different jurisdiction,the appellant was subpoenaed to testify before a different grand jury.at that time,the appellant refused to answer any question beyond his name,address and occupation on the grounds that to do so would violate his long held and unshakeable religious,political and personal beliefs and because he feared his answers would be used against his friends,relatives and colleagues.the district court held him in civil contempt and incarcerated him for days.the appellant began a hunger strike on the first day of his imprisonment that continued until his release.he was while in prison and claims to have suffered a number of medical problems due to his hunger strike.the district court ultimately released him after finding that continued confinement would not coerce the appellant to testify and would instead become punitive,although the court was careful to note that the appellant suffering played no part in the decision to release him.
now the has been served with another subpoena in the northern district of illinois to appear before a different grand jury conducting a different investigation than was at issue five years ago.at his first appearance before the special grand jury,the witness again refused to answer any question beyond his name,address and occupation.the district court granted the witness use immunity pursuant to,and other adequate safeguards were in place.at his second appearance before the special grand jury,the witness continued to refuse to answer any question beyond his name,address and occupation.as the grounds for his refusal,the witness again cited his and unshakeable religious,political and personal beliefs.he also objected on the ground that he believed his answers would be used against him in unfair,illegal and politically motivated prosecutions.moreover,he believed he would be persecuted as a result of his testimony.the witness further refused to answer any questions claiming that the united states government had subjected him to illegal and extensive electronic surveillance that was being used to question him before the special grand jury.
the government petitioned the district court under to hold the witness in contempt for his refusal to answer the questions posed to him before the special grand jury.the witness moved to quash the subpoena.before the district court,he argued that collateral estoppel should prevent the government from petitioning the court for contempt.in essence,he maintained that a different district court finding five years ago that continued incarceration would not coerce him to testify but rather would be punitive was binding on the district court here.he also argued that the government was abusing the grand jury process,that the subpoena and questions posed stemmed from illegal foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa surveillance,and that his religious and political beliefs as well as his fear of retaliation constituted just cause for his refusal to testify.
the district court found collateral estoppel inapplicable to the government petition for contempt because of factual differences between the two cases.first,the subject matter of the prior grand jury investigation differed from that of the current investigation.second,the court found that the witness personal convictions,desires and future plans might have shifted over a period in a manner that would lead to his eventual cooperation with the current investigation.third,the court declined the witness invitation to create a presumption that a witness who has previously staunchly refused to testify will refuse again at a later time in a different proceeding.
the court then proceeded to reject each of the reasons the witness had cited as bases for his refusal to testify.the court rejected for lack of evidence the witness claim that,because the government was well aware when it subpoenaed him that he would refuse to testify and would be held in contempt,the government was abusing the grand jury process as a means to incarcerate him.a witness personal beliefs provided no relief from contempt,the district court found.the court discounted the witness fear of retaliation because the court had granted him immunity and adequate safeguards were in place.as for retaliation by others,the court found that fear of prosecution was not a defense to contempt unless the united states collaborated in any prosecution.the court accepted the government assertion that it had no intention of sharing information garnered in the special grand jury proceedings.
the court then turned to the ultimate question,whether incarceration under civil contempt would be coercive or punitive given all of the circumstances surrounding the witness refusal to testify.the court found that confinement might have the effect of causing the witness to testify in light of his familiarity with the hardships of prison life,the new subject matter of the investigation,and the increased difficulty of bearing the burdens of prison after the passing of years,among other things.
after a joint motion for clarification on the fisa issue,the district court found that none of the witness fisa arguments had any bearing on the contempt proceedings because the witness refused to answer any question at all,including those that clearly did not arise from any surveillance.even if the fisa surveillance was illegal or unconstitutional,the court ruled,the witness was not relieved from his obligation to respond to related questions and was thus in contempt.
the court therefore ordered the witness confinement.on september,the witness turned himself in to the united states marshal for incarceration pursuant to the court order.under the order,the witness will be confined until he testifies,or until the expiration of the special grand jury including extensions,or until the district court determines that confinement is punitive rather than coercive.he appeals.
on appeal,the appellant maintains that the district court abused its discretion in finding him in contempt because the government should be collaterally estopped from bringing contempt proceedings against him when the issue of his willingness to testify under threat of incarceration was already litigated five years ago in another jurisdiction the subpoena and the questions posed in the special grand jury proceedings were the result of illegal and unconstitutional surveillance,according him a complete defense to contempt under gelbard united states,d there is no realistic possibility that the appellant will ever testify and the appellant has a fear of retaliation against himself and his family which fear entitled him to a hearing on both his apprehensions and the adequacy of the safeguards offered.
we turn first to the issue of collateral estoppel.the appellant contends that the government should have been collaterally estopped from seeking contempt for his failure to testify before the special grand jury given another court decision five years ago that incarceration would not coerce the appellant into testifying at that time before a different grand jury.in order for collateral estoppel to apply the issue sought to be precluded must be the same as that involved in the prior action,the issue must have been actually litigated,the determination of the issue must have been essential to the final judgment,and the party against whom estoppel is invoked must be fully represented in the prior action.people who care rockford bd.of,cir.see also loeb,sumitomo,cir,cert.denied.the government maintains that the appellant failed to meet the first and,therefore necessarily,the second elements of collateral estoppel.
the appellant notes that the district court in the earlier action found after days of imprisonment that there was no realistic possibility that further confinement would cause the appellant to testify.the appellant maintains that nothing has changed during the intervening five years.he opines that the special grand jury is investigating the same matters that were under investigation five years ago and that his beliefs,experiences and character have remained static.as before,he has been granted immunity.he argues in the strongest terms that confinement will not result in his cooperation any more today than it did five years ago.having fully litigated the effect of confinement on his willingness to comply with a grand jury subpoena five years ago,he contends the government may not relitigate that issue now.
the salient question then is whether another court finding five years ago that continued imprisonment would not result in the appellant compliance with a subpoena requires the same finding now,after the passage of five years,a change of jurisdiction,a change of grand juries and a change of the subject of investigation the question almost answers itself.collateral estoppel does not apply because an adjudication that he would not testify under the coercion of imprisonment five years ago is by no means dispositive of his present state of mind.indeed,one need only review the statements the appellant made to the grand juries on each occasion to see that his state of mind was influenced by significantly different factors five years ago.at that time,the appellant refused to testify because of his religious,political and personal beliefs and because he feared his answers would be used against his friends,relatives and colleagues.this time,he again cited his religious,personal and political beliefs but also listed a fear of prosecution and persecution by certain third parties,and the use of purportedly illegal surveillance in procuring his testimony.in addition to a grant of immunity from the court,safeguards were in place that addressed the new concerns he identified as motivating his refusal to testify.as the district court noted,the appellant is now older,more familiar with the burdens of confinement,and is being offered adequate safeguards.the court was entitled to find that circumstances have changed in the last five years and the appellant present state of mind differs from his state of mind five years ago.the prior adjudication thus can not act as a bar to the government current petition for contempt.
the appellant next contends that his presence before the special grand jury was procured through information gained in illegal fisa surveillance and that the questions posed to him were the fruit of that poisonous tree.he maintains that the government failed to comply with the conditions that fisa imposes on surveillance of a foreign person,and that the illegality of the surveillance provides a complete defense to contempt.he requests discovery and a hearing on the legality of the surveillance so that he can litigate the adequacy of the fisa applications.the record does not reveal whether the district court reviewed the fisa applications,but this court may rectify any omission in that regard through independent in camera,ex parte review.indeed,both the government and the appellant encouraged us at oral argument to review the fisa materials as a means of resolving this dispute.we have done so and conclude that there is no need to disclose any of the fisa materials to the appellant and that the fisa orders were properly issued.
when the attorney general files,as in this case,a sworn affidavit stating that disclosure or an adversarial hearing would compromise the national security of the united states,a review of fisa wiretaps must be conducted in camera and ex parte.in re grand jury proceedings,grand jury,empaneled september,cir hereafter september,grand jury.see also f.indeed,the appellant was unable to cite any case in which classified or otherwise sealed fisa applications or orders were released to the subject of the investigation for review,even after indictment.at the time that the fourth circuit ruled in september,grand jury,every fisa wiretap review had been conducted in camera and ex parte.at.we have found no cases since that time where the review was conducted in any other fashion.see united states sattar,cr,wl,at,collecting cases finding that no court has ever ordered disclosure of fisa materials rather than conducting in camera,ex parte review and cases holding in camera,ex parte review constitutionally sufficient.the appellant suggested at oral argument that this is that case where disclosure is necessary.nothing we have found in our review of the record supports his suggestion.we therefore have reviewed the materials ex parte and in camera.
a federal officer,with the approval of the attorney general,may apply for an order approving electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information.the application is made to a court specially designated for this purpose hereafter the fisa court.see.the attorney general approval of the application is conditioned on his finding that it satisfies the criteria set forth in a.there are numerous requirements for the applications,all of which we have reviewed for facial validity,but we will focus here on the factors contested by the appellant he challenges the legality of the fisa surveillance on the grounds that he is not an agent of a foreign power,that the facilities at which the surveillance was directed were not being used by an agent of a foreign power,that the information obtained in the surveillance was not properly minimized,and that the information sought by the government could have been reasonably obtained by normal investigative techniques.he also contends that the motivation and intent of the attorney general in obtaining the surveillance was not to gather foreign intelligence information but rather was to circumvent the more stringent probable cause requirements of title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,and to criminalize those participating in a particular political movement.moreover,he asserts that the attorney general and his agents improperly used their fisa authority to gather information for criminal indictments and to incarcerate the appellant without any evidence that he violated any criminal law.
in examining the adequacy of the fisa applications,we conduct the same review that the fisa court conducted and that the district court may have conducted,which,as we noted earlier,is not indicated either way in the record.the fisa court,in reviewing the application,is not to the executive branch official certifications.united states duggan,cir.further,congress intended that,when a person affected by a fisa surveillance challenges the fisa court order,a reviewing court is to have no greater authority to the executive branch certifications than has the fisa judge.duggan,at.we turn then to the fisa court role in reviewing an application for surveillance.the fisa court is authorized to enter an ex parte order approving a request for electronic surveillance if it finds that
