elmer robert keach,iii,appeals from a decision of the united states district court for the northern district of new york gary sharpe,judge denying a motion for recusal and declining to impose sanctions on keach.keach argues that judge sharpe should have recused himself from further proceedings on his sua sponte order to show cause as to why keach should not be sanctioned,and in any event erred in making several erroneous findings that keach engaged in professional misconduct.we conclude that because the district court decision was limited to routine judicial commentary and criticism,without any specific findings of professional misconduct,we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.because we can not review,at keach behest,the judgment denying sanctions against him,neither can we review preliminary procedural rulings such as the denial of the recusal motion in the proceedings leading to that judgment.
background 
i.the underlying conduct 
keach was lead counsel in a class action lawsuit,eventually settled for million,against the county of schenectady and a number of its officials.following the settlement,the district court awarded an attorney fee that was significantly less than keach had requested keach appeal of the fee decision set off a series of events that led the district court to consider whether keach should be sanctioned for his behavior,and,ultimately,to this appeal.
during the settlement negotiations,the defendants attorney had requested that the implementation of the settlement be delayed until after the campaign of the county sheriff,a defendant,was over.not surprisingly,this request,while copied to opposing counsel,was meant to be kept secret,and the letters discussing this proposition were titled confidential for settlement purposes only and for settlement purposes to be filed on the docket.the letters regarding the proposed delay of the settlement were therefore treated as sealed,under the apparent rationale that they were part of settlement negotiations and should remain confidential keach declined the defendants proposal to postpone the settlement implementation,and the settlement was announced prior to the sheriff election.following approval of the settlement,the district court granted a smaller attorney fee than keach had requested,a decision that keach has appealed separately.according to keach,as retaliation for his refusal to postpone the settlement,defendants counsel has opposed his fee appeal.
after filing his notice of appeal,keach wrote to the district court asking that the documents relating to the request to postpone the settlement negotiation be unsealed.the letter revealed the content of the sealed letters,describing them as addressing settlement negotiations and the request of the defendants to delay the settlement of this class action until after the november schenectady county sheriff election.the stated reason for the request to unseal the correspondence was that class counsel plans to include these documents in their joint appendix regarding the pending appeal on attorneys fees.class counsel does not believe there is any present basis to have these items filed with the court under seal,nor should they have to be filed under seal with the second circuit,given that the settlement had been approved and a judgment entered.the district court denied the request,reasoning that t he second circuit has full access to the district court sealed documents.
the request and its denial,both published on the district court docket sheet,had the effect of publicly disclosing the contents of the letters.the same day the district court denied keach request,keach gave the district court order,and his underlying,to the albany times union newspaper,which reported that the sealed documents contained defendants request to postpone the settlement until after the election.keach was quoted in the paper as saying that t here is certainly a story to be told here and i am going to make sure that those documents reach the light of day.soon after,the defendants attorney,william greagan,filed an affidavit asking the court to bar keach from practicing law in the northern district of new york for,inter alia,willfully disregard ing court orders regarding confidential matters thus impairing the power of the court,the rights of the litigants,and the confidence of the litigants in the judicial process.accompanying this affidavit was a letter from greagan to the district court stating that he had submitted the affidavit as a result of a discussion that occurred when he contacted judge sharpe chambers for guidance regarding keach disclosure of privileged information.
upon receiving greagan letter,keach telephoned the judge deputy clerk,john law,to inquire about the guidance greagan had received.law apparently informed keach that the only guidance greagan received was that he should address any concerns to the court in writing.what keach said to law is disputed.but,law was apparently left with the impression that keach had accused the court of improper ex parte communication with greagan.following this conversation,keach again wrote to the district court asking that it publish greagan letter and affidavit which greagan had requested be filed under seal,require greagan to make a formal motion for disbarment,and order that any further communication between greagan and the court be conducted in writing and filed on the public docket.following the last request,kreach added a footnote stating that 
i want to make clear that,by making this request,i am not implying that either the court,or its staff,engaged in any impermissible ex parte communication with greagan about the substance of his application to have me disbarred i also want to make clear that i do not believe that the court provided greagan with guidance to file his application under seal.
ii.the conference 
following receipt of this correspondence,judge sharpe scheduled an conference.judge sharpe began the conference by remarking that greagan application to the court to have keach disbarred was improper,because under the local rules of the northern district of new york such an application would have to be filed with the chief judge of the court.judge sharpe then moved on to discuss whether sanctions should be imposed on keach.
after keach admitted that he had given the district court order declining his request to unseal the documents to the newspaper,judge sharpe questioned whether keach had lied to the court or engaged in subterfuge by writing that he wanted to have the documents unsealed to aid in his second circuit appeal,when his real motivation was to be able to release them to the news media in my view that letter is disingenuous with the court.you had your own ulterior motives for doing it.it had nothing to do with the legal authority of the second circuit to review sealed documents before the district court and i believe it may be grounds for a disciplinary proceeding 
judge sharpe then discussed keach phone conversation with law.judge sharpe noted that an internal chambers record of communications with parties and litigants contained an entry stating that keach had made a bald accusation to my courtroom deputy that i had engaged in illegal ex parte communications with greagan.judge sharpe noted that this was followed by keach letter containing the footnote stressing that he was not accusing the court of any improper ex parte contact in my view that is a specific,hang up the phone,oh,my g od,what did i just say to the court.let me do what i have a history of doing,denying that i meant what i said and i document it in a letter so that later on i got plausible deniability over the fact that i just accused the court of illegal ex parte communications.
following this,judge sharpe recited a string of previous incidents in which keach had been criticized or warned by other northern district of new york judges in a variety of matters.the court concluded that y ou have been dancing on a thin wire for a long time in this district,keach.and you ought to be mindful that these kinds of proceedings have a dramatic impact on your ability to earn a living in a variety of courts in a variety of juris
