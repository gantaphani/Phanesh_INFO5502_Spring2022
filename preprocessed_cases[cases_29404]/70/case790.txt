the issue in this case is when,if ever,a trial court may strike a plaintiff pleadings as a sanction without first testing the effectiveness of lesser sanctions.we conclude that in this case,the trial court did not abuse its discretion by striking the plaintiff pleadings and imposing death penalty sanctions when the plaintiff violated the trial court orders by deliberately destroying dispositive evidence sought by the defendant in discovery.thus,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and accordingly,render a judgment against cummings.
attorneys george cire and martha adams and the law firm of taylor cire collectively cire represented carla cummings cummings in a suit against texas utilities fuel company tufco.after the tufco litigation settled,cummings filed a legal malpractice fee forfeiture suit against cire,claiming that cire told her the settlement would be tax free and that cire did not explain how the settlement or the resulting attorney fees would be structured and paid.
during pretrial discovery of the malpractice suit,cummings testified that she had several conversations with cire during the tufco litigation,including discussions of the settlement negotiations.specifically,the record reflects that cummings made between to secret audiotape recordings during the eight months preceding the settlement agreement,and she kept the audiotapes in her home office.
cire requested production of the audiotapes in discovery and cummings objected to the request.cire then moved to compel production.cummings did not file a response.without an oral hearing,the trial court entered an order compelling production.the trial court found that cummings filed evasive,incomplete answers and frivolous objections to discovery requests.the trial court also ordered that cummings counsel pay in attorney fees to cire counsel.
cummings did not comply with the trial court order.instead,cummings sought a writ of mandamus,which was denied by the court of appeals and this court.the trial court again ordered cummings to comply with the discovery requests,and after cummings again refused to comply,the trial court granted cire second motion to compel.again,cummings refused to comply,so cire filed a motion to strike cummings pleadings.it is not contested that cummings had possession of the audiotapes.nor is it an issue that cummings had a duty to preserve the audiotapes once they were sought by cire in discovery.see stores,johnson.
at the sanctions hearing,cummings admitted that she had possession of the audiotapes she made recording conversations with her attorneys.there was testimony that the audiotapes contained recorded conversations regarding the tufco settlement and that cummings planned to use the audiotapes against cire to help her case.elizabeth martinez,cummings friend and neighbor,testified that she had seen to audiotapes in cummings home office approximately two shoe boxes full that cummings had made of her conversations with cire.martinez also testified that she and several others heard portions of the audiotapes.the audiotapes were the only evidence that would support or disprove cummings claims of misrepresentation.the record does not reflect that there was any other evidence that would support either side position.
cummings testified at the hearing that she did not destroy the audiotapes and that she did not tell anyone to destroy the audiotapes.however,cire presented evidence at the sanctions hearing that cummings burned the audiotapes in the presence of elizabeth martinez,and that cummings laughed with her friends about being a habitual liar.after listening to the evidence presented,the trial court determined that cummings deliberately destroyed the audiotapes to avoid production,and,based on this determination,properly presumed that her actions prevented cire from obtaining objective proof that they were not liable.see transamerican natural gas powell,noting that a party hindrance of the discovery process may justify a presumption that its claims lack merit.cummings own statements that the audiotapes would help her case against cire supports the trial court findings that the audiotapes were material and relevant to the case.cummings deliberate destruction of the audiotapes further justifies the trial court presumption that,contrary to cummings assertions,the tapes would not have helped her case.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in making these findings of fact based on the testimony presented.the trial court granted the motion to strike the pleadings as a sanction for cummings failure to comply with the discovery orders.
in its order,the trial court primary focus was on cummings failure to produce the audiotapes.the trial court found that cummings flagrantly violated four discovery orders by her failure to comply with them,tried to hide her relationship with other attorneys by refusing to answer deposition questions,used forged documents to gain an advantage with the court,gave conflicting testimony under oath,and deliberately destroyed concealed material evidence the audiotapes that would show cummings claims had no merit.
the trial court found that less stringent sanctions would be ineffective,reasoning that because cummings counsel never paid the sanction for filing frivolous objections to discovery,monetary sanctions would not deter cummings.in addition,the court found that less stringent sanctions could not cure cummings wrongdoing based on its presumption that cummings destruction of the audiotapes,after they had been repeatedly ordered produced,deprived cire of objective factual evidence that went to the heart of the proof required to show that cummings claims lacked merit.the court of appeals reversed,holding that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to consider alternative,lesser sanctions and when it did not explain why lesser sanctions would not suffice.at.the court of appeals noted that the trial court had only issued sanctions once before striking cummings pleadings.emphasizing that the fine imposed was against cummings attorney,the court of appeals concluded that the failure to pay the fine should not be used as evidence that a lesser sanction against cummings would have been ineffective.the court of appeals also said that the trial court could have and should have considered other,lesser sanctions before it imposed death penalty sanctions.it suggested a less stringent sanction a spoliation instruction to the jury directing it to assume the missing audiotapes would have been unfavorable to cummings.ultimately,the court of appeals concluded that the trial court violated gte communications.tanner,when it refused to consider lesser sanctions.
we granted the petition to consider the issue of death penalty sanctions and to examine whether a trial court sanctions order must recite why every conceivable sanction would be ineffective in securing compliance and curing prejudice before striking pleadings.
a trial court ruling on a motion for sanctions is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.bodnow city of hondo,downer aquamarine operators.the test for an abuse of discretion is not whether,in the opinion of the reviewing court,the facts present an appropriate case for the trial court action,but whether the court acted without reference to any guiding rules and principles.downer,at see also bodnow,at.the trial court ruling should be reversed only if it was arbitrary or unreasonable.downer,at.
texas rule of civil procedure allows a trial court to sanction a party for failure to comply with a discovery order or request.rule b lists the sanctions a court may impose.they include an order disallowing any further discovery of any kind an order charging all or a portion of the expenses of discovery against the disobedient party an order that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established an order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses,or prohibiting designated evidence from being introduced into evidence an order striking out pleadings or parts thereof,staying the action until the order is obeyed,dismissing the action with or without prejudice,or rendering judgment by default a contempt order and an order requiring the disobedient party to pay reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,caused by the failure.civ.b.
sanctions are used to assure compliance with discovery and deter those who might be tempted to abuse discovery in the absence of a deterrent.downer,at.however,a trial court may not impose a sanction that is more severe than necessary to satisfy its legitimate purpose.hamill level.here,the court of appeals relied on our previous holdings in transamerican natural gas powell,and chrysler blackmon,in concluding that the trial court sanctions were too severe.
in transamerican,the trial court struck transamerican pleadings because transamerican president failed to appear for a deposition.we held that rule requires that any sanctions imposed be just,and explained that there are two components to measuring whether an imposition of sanctions is just.first,a direct relationship must exist between the offensive conduct and the sanction imposed.transamerican,at.we noted that t his means that a just sanction must be directed against the abuse and toward remedying the prejudice caused the innocent party.id.second,the sanctions must not be excessive id.in other words,t he punishment should fit the crime courts must consider the availability of less stringent sanctions and whether such lesser sanctions would fully promote compliance.id.emphasis added.we explained 
discovery sanctions can not be used to adjudicate the merits of a party claims or defenses unless a party hindrance of the discovery process justifies a presumption that its claims or defenses lack merit.however,if a party refuses to produce material evidence,despite the imposition of lesser sanctions,the court may presume that an asserted claim or defense lacks merit and dispose of it sanctions which are so severe as to preclude presentation of the merits of the case should not be assessed absent a party flagrant bad faith or counsel callous disregard for the responsibilities of discovery under the rules.
id.at citations omitted.ultimately,we concluded that the trial court sanctions in transamerican were too severe because there was nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court considered the imposition of lesser sanctions.we also noted that the record strongly suggested that lesser sanctions should have been utilized and that they might have been effective.id.we gave several specific examples of lesser sanctions that the trial court could have considered or used before imposing the death penalty sanction 
the district court could have ordered shephard deposition for a specific date and punished any failure to comply with that order by contempt or another sanction.he also could have taxed the costs of the deposition against transamerican and awarded toma attorney fees.
in chrysler,the second case the court of appeals relied on,the trial court struck chrysler pleadings when chrysler refused to produce reports that were repeatedly requested by the plaintiffs.we noted that lesser sanctions must first be tested to determine whether they are adequate before a sanction that prevented a decision on the merits of a case could be justified.chrysler,at emphasis added.we conditionally granted mandamus relief and ordered the trial court to set aside the order,holding that the trial court had failed to meet the standards set out in transamerican in four ways.first,there was no direct relationship between the offensive conduct and the sanction imposed,as the plaintiffs did not show that they were unable to prepare for trial without the test reports,and the record did not demonstrate chrysler ability to produce the test reports.second,striking chrysler pleadings and rendering a default judgment was more severe than necessary to satisfy the legitimate purposes of sanctions for discovery abuse.third,no lesser sanction was first imposed.finally,death penalty sanctions should not be used to deny a trial on the merits unless the court finds that the sanctioned party conduct justifies a presumption that its claims or defenses lack merit and that it would be unjust to permit the party to present the substance of that position which is the subject of the withheld discovery before the court.id.at.
our decision in chrysler was soon followed by gte communications.tanner.in gte,we conditionally granted mandamus relief when a telephone cord manufacturer was improperly sanctioned for failing to produce a memorandum when there was no evidence that it had actual or constructive possession of the document.gte,at.we reaffirmed our transamerican holding in gte,specifically noting that a trial court was required to consider the availability of lesser sanctions before imposing death penalty sanctions.under this standard,the trial court need not test the effectiveness of each available lesser sanction by actually imposing the lesser sanction on the party before issuing the death penalty rather,the trial court must analyze the available sanctions and offer a reasoned explanation as to the appropriateness of the sanction imposed.gte,at t he record must reflect the trial court considered the availability of lesser sanctions.see also spohn hosp.mayer,noting that the record should contain some explanation of the appropriateness of the sanctions imposed transamerican,at.however,we did not overrule the language in chrysler requiring that lesser sanctions first be tested to determine whether they are adequate before a death penalty sanction could be justified in our gte opinion.instead,we reemphasized that sanctions may only be imposed in exceptional cases where they are clearly justified and it is fully apparent that no lesser sanctions would promote compliance with the rules.gte,at.this holding was reaffirmed in spohn hosp.mayer,requiring a trial court to consider less stringent measures before settling on severe sanctions,but reiterating that death penalty sanctions may only be imposed in the first instance when the facts of the case are exceptional and such a sanction is clearly justified.
in light of the gte holding,we must first decide whether the facts of this case make it one of the exceptional cases warranting death penalty sanctions.second,we must determine whether the trial court discussion of lesser sanctions in its order complies with our earlier holdings in transamerican,chrysler,and gte that the trial court consider the availability of less stringent sanctions,and in all but the most exceptional cases,actually test the lesser sanctions before striking the pleadings.
here,the trial court not only found that cummings refused to produce the audiotapes,but also found that cummings deliberately destroyed the audiotapes after being thrice ordered to produce them.based on the destruction of evidence,the trial court then presumed that the audiotapes go to the heart of the proof needed by defendants to show plaintiff claims are without merit.the trial court explained that the destruction of the audiotapes take s away from these defendants the ability to show by recorded conversations documents objective proof that these defendants are not liable.because the audiotapes sought by cire would have either proved or disproved cummings claims,her destruction of them justifies a presumption they would have done the latter.on this record,it was within the trial court discretion to determine that cummings deliberately destroyed dispositive evidence thus,death penalty sanctions are warranted in this exceptional case.as we explained in transamerican,discovery sanctions can be used to adjudicate the merits of a party claims when a party hindrance of the discovery process justifies a presumption that its claims lack merit.transamerican,at.here,without the destroyed audiotapes,cummings claims lack merit.
the trial court explained 
the court finds less stringent sanctions are not required here because less stringent sanctions would be ineffective.plaintiff recorded conversations with the defendants when they discussed with plaintiff critical factual statements that plaintiff alleges support her claims against these defendants
