romm is an optometrist who,until,operated four pearle vision stores pursuant to franchise agreements he had entered into with pearle vision.on june,pearle vision filed suit alleging that romm had materially defaulted under those agreements romm alleged infractions included incorrectly charging customers or charging them for services or products not received,poor record keeping,and abandoning at least one store for three or more days.pearle vision sought damages for romm violation of the franchise agreements,as well as a permanent injunction prohibiting romm from further operating the stores and granting possession of them to pearle vision.
on august,pearle vision filed a motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to enjoin romm from further possessing or operating the stores,using either the pearle or pearle vision marks,or competing with pearle vision within three miles of the stores in question.the parties appeared for a hearing on september,they informed the court that they had come to an agreement where romm would cease operation and give up possession of the stores,and cease using pearle vision marks.two days later,however,pearle vision filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction in which it alleged that romm was observed after on september,removing boxes from one of the stores and loading them onto a rental truck.pearle vision asserted that this violated portions of the franchise agreement requiring romm to cooperate in an orderly change of management when the agreements were terminated,as well as giving pearle vision the right to purchase equipment present in the stores.pearle vision also argued that romm was obligated under their agreement to give it copies of all his patient records.romm responded that he had moved the items in question to a storage unit,and that he was entitled to do so because pearle vision failed to exercise its purchase right upon initiating termination procedures in june.on september,the court entered an emergency preliminary injunction directing romm to make all of the store equipment available to pearle vision,and further stating that pearle vision shall have the right to inspect and remove all patient charts and records,including all records relating to optometric or opthomologic services from the operations on the premises,and inspect any hard drive which may contain any such information.
on october,pearle vision filed the first of three petitions for a rule to show cause alleging that romm had failed to comply with the september injunction.pearle vision alleged,among other things,that romm had failed to make available to pearle vision representative all of his patient records.these allegations were later verified by franchise manager michael maziarek who testified at a hearing that the only patient records he found at romm storage unit were three tupperware trays containing records no more current than.when maziarek asked romm about the remaining records,romm stated that anything not in the unit was at the stores.maziarek visited the stores the following day,but again did not find any records more current than.he did find file drawers labeled and,but they were empty.at the hearing on pearle vision petition,the court told romm that it appeared he had violated the court order and that he was going to be sanctioned,but that the sanction would be reduced if he complied by making the delivery to pearle vision in a timely fashion.the district court issued an order on october,directing romm to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court,and further directing him to deliver to pearle vision,by that day at a pearle vision store in south elgin,the equipment and records as set forth in its september injunction.
despite this clear direction,romm failed to show up on october,prompting pearle vision to file its second petition the following day.the court issued another order,this time directing romm to make delivery of the relevant items to pearle vision by of that day,and again directing romm to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court.romm was not present at the hearing on the second petition,but the district court judge informed his counsel,who was present,that there was undoubtedly going to be a sanction imposed on romm for his conduct and that she was shocked and appalled by romm behavior.
on october,pearle vision filed its third petition for a rule to show cause.pearle vision alleged that romm arrived as directed on october,but still failed to comply fully with the court injunction.first,pearle vision claimed that romm had failed to return the total amount of equipment that would have been present in fully equipped stores,and provided an itemized list of what it believed to be missing.more importantly,pearle vision alleged that romm had failed to produce all of the patient records.it admitted that romm delivered boxes of patient records which were later determined to cover the years following.romm also delivered three personal computers,but they contained no patient data.this was not unusual because pearle vision stated that the normal in its stores was to have personal computer input terminals which relayed patient data to a central server that stored the information.however,romm did not produce a server.thus,there was no way to verify that all the physical records had been turned over.pearle vision claimed to be further aggrieved because computer utilization of the patient files facilitates easier searches of their contents and status.
a hearing on the third petition was held on october.while the hearing was not completed that day,the court believed it had sufficient information before it to establish romm with its injunction order.therefore,on that same day,the court entered an order sanctioning romm at the rate of per day until such time as he complied with the court september injunction order by producing the equipment and patient records in question.the court further stated that the sanction was subject to its ultimate findings after completing the hearing.
the court resumed the hearing on october,and heard testimony from romm,maziarek,and a computer analyst named gary wadhani,who had analyzed the computers received from romm to determine their contents.wadhani confirmed the allegations pearle vision made earlier that there was no patient data contained on the machines.wadhani also testified that upon starting the computers,they attempted to connect to a server,and that they were therefore likely only work stations meant to connect to the machine that actually contained data.romm testified that he did not want to be in contempt of court,and that he had returned everything he had to pearle vision.moments later,however,he testified that he had maintained patient information,such as addresses,appointment dates,and prescription information,on computers in his stores.
the court found that wadhani testimony,as well as romm admission that he kept patient data on computers,cast doubt on romm assertion that he had complied with the court order to deliver all patient records to pearle vision after noting its hope that the sanction amount would not turn into an actual judgment,the court expressed its belief that romm was not in compliance with the injunction order.it stated that romm had been given an opportunity to explain what happened to the dat
