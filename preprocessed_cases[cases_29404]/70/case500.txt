facts and procedural background 
this appeal centers on the appropriateness of rule sanctions against an attorney who filed a legally baseless complaint.on february,levinson,counsel for deborah and robert holgate,filed the complaint at issue in federal district court.in this complaint,the holgates alleged federal civil rights and rico violations,as well as state causes of action,resulting from the construction and financing of their home.in brief,the holgates borrowed from the community bank of nevada to build their dream home.when the costs of building their home ran over,the holgates borrowed an additional from michael newell and the baldwin trust to finish the job.after the holgates defaulted on this loan,newell and the baldwin trust foreclosed and completed the construction.the holgates alleged that the defendants actions related to the home financing violated their civil rights and were otherwise in violation of state and federal law.
in reviewing the district court award of sanctions we must determine whether each defendant satisfied rule safe harbor requirement.the timing of the service and filing of each defendant motion for rule sanctions against levinson are central to this determination.while each of the three defendants requested sanctions against levinson based on the filing of the complaint,each defendant did so at different times in the course of the litigation.
on march,john baldwin served levinson with a proposed motion for rule sanctions.a month later,on april,baldwin filed his motion with the district court.rather than serving levinson with their own motion,on august,the newell defendants moved to join baldwin motion for sanctions against levinson.on august,the district court granted levinson motion to withdraw as counsel due to a conflict of interest.during the same hearing,the district court cautioned levinson that it was retaining jurisdiction over him for any future rule motions.community bank eventually served levinson with its own motion for sanctions almost six months later,on february.
on march,plaintiffs,through new counsel,moved for voluntary dismissal of their complaint under federal rule of civil procedure a.the district court dismissed the plaintiffs federal claims with prejudice and their state claims without prejudice,but retained jurisdiction over the parties to consider the imposition of sanctions.after this dismissal,community bank filed its motion for rule sanctions with the district court on may.
on the same date,the district court granted all three defendants motions for sanctions against levinson.levinson responded by filing motions for sanctions against community bank and the newell defendants.the district court denied levinson motions,and he timely appealed these denials as well as the sanctions awarded against him.

discussion 
i.the district court did not err in finding the complaint frivolous 
an attorney is subject to rule sanctions,among other reasons,when he presents to the court claims,defenses,and other legal contentions not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.b.when,as here,a complaint is the primary focus of rule proceedings,a district court must conduct a inquiry to determine whether the complaint is legally or factually baseless from an objective perspective,and if the attorney has conducted a reasonable and competent inquiry before signing and filing it.christian mattel,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.as shorthand for this test,we use the word frivolous to denote a filing that is both baseless and made without a reasonable and competent inquiry.moore keegan mgmt.co in re keegan mgmt,sec.litig,cir.the district court determined that the complaint filed by levinson was frivolous and therefore a proper basis for the rule sanctions against him.we agree.
adequate legal basis 
the complaint filed by levinson alleged a due process violation based on,which prohibits conspiracies for the purpose of depriving,either directly or indirectly,any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws.the original purpose of,which was passed as the ku klux klan act of,was to enforce the rights of african americans and their supporters.see sever alaska pulp,cir.we have extended to protect groups only if the courts have designated the class in question a suspect or classification requiring more exacting scrutiny or congress has indicated through legislation that the class require s special protection.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.plaintiffs did not allege in their complaint that they belong to a racial group or an otherwise protected class,nor did they allege that the defendants intentionally discriminated against them on such grounds.later,however,the holgates contended that they were members of the protected class of consumers looking to build their dream home.not surprisingly,plaintiffs cited no case law recognizing such a class as meriting heightened protection.nor can we consider their argument one for a extension of existing case law,as the supreme court has held that group actions generally resting on economic motivations should be deemed beyond the reach of.united of carpenters joiners of am.scott,d.
the complaint also failed to allege evidence of a conspiracy and an act in furtherance of that conspiracy,which are required elements of a action.sever,at.it alleged that newell and others conspired to violate the holgates civil rights,but it did not allege that a specific act was committed in furtherance of this conspiracy.as the complaint failed on its face to allege a required element of a claim,the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding it lacked adequate legal support.even under the liberal notice pleading rules set out by the federal rules of civil procedure,the holgates were required to do more.a.while rule a does not require plaintiffs to lay out in detail the facts upon which their claims are based,it does require plaintiffs to provide a short and plain statement of the claim to give the defendants fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it is based.see swierkiewicz sorema,d leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d.the holgates complaint failed even this minimal test.
we have held that the mere existence of one claim in a complaint does not immunize it from rule sanctions.townsend holman consulting,cir.accordingly,because we conclude that the plaintiffs claim lacked legal merit,we need not assess the legal support for the holgates rico or state law claims.
reasonable inquiry 
the reasonable inquiry test is meant to assist courts in discovering whether an attorney,after conducting an objectively reasonable inquiry into the facts and law,would have found the complaint to be.christian,at.the fact that the holgates second counsel recommended that they request voluntary dismissal of the complaint suggests that levinson did not conduct a reasonable inquir
