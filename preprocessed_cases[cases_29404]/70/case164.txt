opinion of the court 
in the underlying bankruptcy action,neil ettinger and ettinger and associates,llc jointly and severally,ettinger filed an adversary complaint objecting to the discharge of legal fees owed by tammy and gregory miller the millers,ettinger former clients and the debtors in bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court threw out the complaint,which asserted that the millers outstanding debt was nondischargeable because it was obtained via fraud,and imposed a sanction against ettinger jointly with his bankruptcy counsel,demetrios tsarouhis.the district court vacated this ruling on the ground that the sanctions order violated the procedural safe harbor requirements of fed,but it refused to remand the case for further consideration under rule b ecause it is too late to cure the safe harbor violation.dist.mem.order at june.moreover,because the bankruptcy court based its decision to sanction on rule,the district court would not opine in the first instance on whether sanctions grounded in some other authority would have been appropriate.id.yet it also refused to remand to the bankruptcy court for that consideration.we agree with the district court legal conclusion on rule,but remand the case with instruction to permit the bankruptcy court to consider alternative avenues to impose sanctions.
background 
the millers retained ettinger in january to represent them in a dispute.over a month period,ettinger ran up a bill of approximately,although the dispute was ultimately settled for.during the course of this litigation,the millers paid ettinger approximately in legal fees.even before the matter had been resolved,however,ettinger sought relief in pennsylvania state court in an attempt to accelerate the speed at which he was being paid the outstanding amount owed close to.he twice petitioned the court to withdraw as a counsel,first based on the millers alleged failure to pay in october,and then due to their professed lack of cooperation in the underlying dispute in december.
both petitions were rejected,though the millers were ordered to make good faith payments in exchange for continued representation despite their continued payments,ettinger sued the millers in march,asserting claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit.the millers filed for chapter bankruptcy protection the following month,giving rise to these proceedings.
bankruptcy court proceedings 
after the millers filed for chapter bankruptcy,ettinger acting through tsarouhis filed an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court in august in an attempt to prevent the discharge of the millers remaining legal debt to him in his adversary complaint,ettinger raised allegations of fraud and misrepresentation,though in previous proceedings he had characterized the millers alleged failure to pay as a purely contractual claim.the bankruptcy court held a trial on the adversary complaint in april,immediately after which it found in favor of the millers on the dischargeability of their debt.as outlined below,whether and when ettinger and tsarouhis may have engaged in sanctionable behavior during the litigation of the adversary complaint was a recurring issue throughout the bankruptcy proceedings.
initial motion for sanctions 
on january,the millers filed and served on ettinger and tsarouhis a rule motion for sanctions initial motion.it asserted that ettinger complaint was filed to harass and cause them to incur additional fees and further delay and for absolutely no reason other than to retaliate against them.millers mot.for rule sanctions.the following day,february,the millers withdrew the initial motion without explanation and served a copy of their withdrawal request on ettinger and tsarouhis.
on february,the millers and reserved a motion substantively the same as their initial motion.the bankruptcy court ruled shortly thereafter that the motion is premature,shall be held in abeyance,and shall not be heard until after the merits of this adversary proceeding have been determined.scheduling order at.
litigation of adversary complaint 
although not asserted in his complaint,ettinger apparently believed that,at some time during his representation of the millers,a bankruptcy attorney advised them they could avoid paying ettinger bill by filing for bankruptcy.during discovery,the millers admitted that they had met previously with pennsylvania bankruptcy attorney james kutkowski however,they indicated that they had consulted him regarding refinancing rather than bankruptcy.
kutkowski was deposed on march.in his deposition,kutkowski first indicated that he might have discussed bankruptcy at a meeting with gregory miller but that he really truthfully did not remember.in response to a question,kutkowski testified that he was fairly confident that he did discuss briefly the option of bankruptcy.kutkowski also testified at the trial on ettinger adversary complaint,held on april,at which he indicated he did not remember whether he had discussed bankruptcy at his meeting with miller,but that it was reasonable that it may have come up.
at the conclusion of the april trial,the bankruptcy court issued a bench ruling in favor of the millers,categorically rejecting ettinger claim that the millers prepetition debt for legal fees was nondischargeable.it recounted the twelve reasons asserted by ettinger for nondischargeability,none of which were accurate or correct and some of which were offensive.following the issuance of its dischargeability ruling,the court told the millers to file a revised motion.
amended rule motion 
in accord with the bankruptcy court order,the millers filed and served an amended motion for sanctions against ettinger and tsarouhis they responded by arguing in part that the millers amended motion did not comply with rule safe harbor provision.that provision requires days between serving and filing a sanctions motion,during which period the challenged conduct may be remedied.
the bankruptcy court granted the amended motion.rejecting ettinger and tsarouhis procedural argument that rule safe harbor was violated,the court found that the day notice requirement was satisfied by the first filing on january and on february of the millers initial motion,during which period ettinger and tsarouhis could have taken yet elected not to take corrective action with respect to their sanctionable conduct.
on the merits,the bankruptcy court concluded that all actions taken by ettinger and tsarouhis after kutkowski march deposition were sanctionable.that deposition testimony,the court concluded,established that the millers had not attempted to discharge fraudulently their legal fees by filing for bankruptcy protection.it described kutkowski deposition as the linchpin on which its decision turned.because this left the complaint without factual support,the court found that the continued prosecution by ettinger and tsarouhis warranted sanctions.subsequently,it ordered them to pay an aggregate sanction of.that sum was to be held in escrow pending approval of the millers attorneys fees application,then be distributed between the millers and their counsel in accord with a stipulated agreement submitted to and approved by the court.
district court decision 
the parties filed,and in june the district court reversed the bankruptcy court sanction decision on procedural grounds.the district court concluded that the sanction could not stand because the millers had failed to comply with the notice requirements of rule.specifically,it found that the millers withdrawal and of their initial motion did not provide ettinger and tsarouhis with fair notice of the conduct claimed to violate rule,and that,even if this motion had triggered the safe harbor period,the millers failed to wait the required number of days after service before because service by mail added three days to the period.it also criticized the bankruptcy court reliance on conduct that was raised for the first time in the amended motion,which was filed after trial and thus too late for ettinger and tsarouhis to cure the offensive conduct.
because curing the safe harbor violation was no longer possible,it was impossible to provide ettinger and tsarouhis days during which they might correct the sanctionable conduct,the district court refused to remand the issue to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.while it noted there were several other mechanisms by which the bankruptcy court could have sanctioned ettinger and tsarouhis,the district court refused to consider the appropriateness of sanctions under any of those alternative options in light of the bankruptcy court sole reliance on rule.apparently for that reason,a remand to consider those options was refused.

iii.analysis 
on appeal,the millers challenge the district court procedural dismissal on the ground that they substantially complied with rule safe harbor requirements.specifically,they argue that the initial motion was sufficient to put ettinger and tsarouhis on notice of the allegedly sanctionable conduct,and that the district court erroneously included three additional days,based on service by mail,when computing the safe harbor period.the millers also assert that the district court erred in concluding they could not recover for behavior occurring after filing their initial motion.in the alternative,the millers assert that,even assuming rule procedural prerequisites were not met,the district court should have remanded because there are other means by which the bankruptcy court could properly impose sanctions.
rule overview 
rule requires,inter alia,that attorneys submissions to the court not be presented for any improper purpose,such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation,that legal assertions be warranted by existing law,and that factual contentions have evidentiary support.fed.b.if any of these requirements is violated,a court has the discretion after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond to impose sanctions,which may be initiated by motion or sua sponte by the court.id.c.
rule safe harbor provides that,if a party is moving for sanctions,the motion for sanctions may not be filed with or presented to the court unless,within days after service of the motion or such other period as the court may prescribe,the challenged paper,claim,defense,contention,allegation,or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected.id.c a.only after this day safe harbor period may the moving party file its motion with the court.id.
the purpose of the safe harbor is to give parties the opportunity to correct their errors,with the practical effect being that a party can not delay serving its rule motion until conclusion of the case or judicial rejection of the offending contention.in re schaefer salt recovery,cir quoting.advisory committee notes amendments hereinafter rule advisory notes as the tenth circuit court explained 
the safe harbor provisions were intended to protect litigants from sanctions whenever possible in order to mitigate rule chilling effects,formalize procedural due process considerations such as notice for the protection of the party accused of sanctionable behavior,and encourage the withdrawal of papers that violate the rule without involving the court.

compliance with safe harbor requirements 
as an initial matter,we address the technical prerequisites for satisfaction of rule procedural safe harbor provision.the district court concluded correctly that strict compliance with the safe harbor rule is required.as we explained in schaefer salt,i f the day period is not provided,the motion must be denied.at rule imposes mandatory obligations upon the party seeking sanctions,so that failure to comply with the procedural requirements precludes the imposition of the requested sanctions.brickwood contractors,datanet eng g,cir en banc.
we note,as did the district court,that there is a split of authority regarding whether an initially noncompliant rule motion after days provides fair notice for such sanctions.compare tahfs proctor,cir suggesting may cure previous safe harbor noncompliance,jefferson.mut.life ins,wl,at,same,and muhammad louisiana,wl,at,same,with in re new river dry dock,rejecting reliance on premature filing to satisfy safe harbor,and xiangyuan zhu fed.hous.fin,khv,wl,at,same.the district court sided with the courts that have found this type of fails to satisfy rule safe harbor.we need not resolve this issue,however,because even if the millers initial motion started the safe harbor clock,they nonetheless failed to wait the requisite period before.
here,the millers filed and served the initial motion on january,making days from service february.however,because february was a federal holiday,the safe harbor was extended until the following day february,see fed.a c,a a.the millers served their motion for sanctions by mail in accord with the bankruptcy court rules of procedure.see id.c a indicating sanctions motions must comply with fed.service requirements id.b requiring service by mail.when computing time for service by mail,three additional days are added after the prescribed period would otherwise expire.id.f.adding three days extended the safe harbor period to february,meaning the earliest the millers could have in compliance with rule notice requirements was february.because they on february days before the safe harbor period had expired their initial motion was procedurally defective,and any sanction based thereon was invalid 
the millers argue the additional three days for mail service should not be added to the day period because they served ettinger and tsarouhis electronically as well as by mail.they rely solely on the eastern district of pennsylvania local rules,however,and do not cite any authority indicating these rules trump the bankruptcy court rules of procedure.absent such support,we agree with the computation of time made by the district court which is surely familiar with its local rules of the safe harbor period.
sanctioning post motion conduct 
the district court also found another procedural problem with the sanctions imposed,this time regarding due process notice requirements.in particular,the court expressed concern because the sanctions were based on facts additional to and different from those in the initial motion,yet the millers amended motion,standing alone,undisputedly did not comply with the safe harbor provision.see dist.mem.order at noting the bankruptcy court sanctioned ettinger and tsarouhis for conduct that had not even occurred at the time the millers filed and served their initial rule motions,but allowed the millers to rely on these motions to satisfy the safe harbor notice requirement.and by the time the millers filed their amended motion,ettinger and tsa
