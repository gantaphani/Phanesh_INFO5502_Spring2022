the federal criminal prosecution of defendants emile fort,edgar diaz,and robert calloway for racketeering and various predicate crimes is pending trial.defendants are alleged to be members of the down below gang,a san street gang operating in the sunnydale public housing project.they stand accused of engaging in an illegal enterprise of individuals associated in fact,who dealt drugs,committed robberies,and assaulted and killed those they believed were cooperating with the police.the witnesses who are expected to testify for the united states are primarily residents of the housing project,and the district court has found that the government has made a substantial showing of danger to inculpatory witnesses.
the united states brings this interlocutory appeal to challenge a discovery order issued by the district court june order.the june order ruled that police reports created by san francisco police officers prior to the federal prosecution of defendants do not qualify for the discovery exception created by federal rule of criminal procedure a,even though those investigative reports are in the hands of the federal prosecutor for the purpose of pursuing charges against defendants under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.the government refused to comply with the discovery order,and the district court sanctioned the noncompliance.on appeal,the government seeks review of the sanction and of the district court underlying decision regarding the scope of rule a.defendants fort and diaz the sanction order and seek additional sanctions against the government.
we hold that the documents in dispute are not discoverable because they are covered by federal rule of criminal procedure a whether prepared by federal,state,or local officials.accordingly,we vacate the june order and do not reach the merits of the government challenge to the sanction imposed.we do not have jurisdiction over defendants.
in addition,the government petitions for a writ of mandamus to reverse a separate order august order of the district court.the august order requires the government to produce a list of witnesses to defendants days before trial,pursuant to.the government submitted a notice of noncompliance to the district court but has not yet violated the order nor been sanctioned.for the reasons that we explain below,we remand the august order without ruling on the mandamus petition.
factual and procedural background 
a grand jury returned an second superseding indictment charging defendants fort,diaz,calloway,and several other people with racketeering crimes that include predicate acts involving drugs,firearms,murder,and attempted murder.in the course of discovery,the district court issued a number of orders compelling the government to turn over witness information to the defendants.defendants fort,diaz,and calloway are the only three defendants who are involved in this appeal.
rule orders 
the first set of orders at issue here relates to inculpatory police reports created by the san francisco police department prior to the initiation of the federal prosecution of defendants.the government disclosed many thousands of pages of these reports to defendants during discovery but redacted all witness names and locator information.
the district court issued a series of orders relating to the discoverability of the police reports.the first order,dated may,held that all investigative reports created by the san francisco police that are in the possession,custody or control of the united states attorney office are documents subject to discovery within the meaning of federal rule of criminal procedure a e.it further held that a report is exempt from discovery under the provisions of rule a only if the report was prepared in connection with investigating or prosecuting the subject case by police officers having a relationship to the federal prosecutors substantially equivalent to that of federal investigative agents.the court invited the government to demonstrate that the reports were so prepared.the government made no such showing.
the district court finalized its discovery ruling with regard to the police reports in its june order.it held that all of the local police reports related to this case in the possession of the united states attorney office are producible under rule and are not within the exemption to rule a.the district court also made two alternative rulings relating to waiver.first,it held that any rule a protection that may have attached to the police reports was waived by the government when it voluntarily and intentionally produced portions of the reports to defendants.second,it held that the government further waived any rule protection with regard to a number of the police reports by allowing a witness for the government who is an expert on gang crimes to rely on the reports in forming his conclusions.the june order directed the government to allow defendants access to the information redacted from the police reports pursuant to the terms of an accompanying protective order for witness security protective order and memorandum opinion,also issued on june.
the district court devised the protective order without the government cooperation.in its related memorandum opinion,the court found that the government had made a substantial showing of serious physical danger to inculpatory witnesses.in its view,the terms of the protective order would improve,rather than impede,the witnesses security.the protective order contained extensive regulation of the discovery and use of protected information.
the government promptly filed a notice of noncompliance with regard to the protective order.the district court issued a sanction order on july,that precludes the government from using against defendants the testimony of any inculpatory civilian witness whose name was redacted from discoverable materials,unless the government demonstrates that the refusal to allow access was substantially harmless.
the government appealed both the rule ruling and july,sanction order.defendants fort and diaz filed a challenging the sanction order,arguing that the district court should,additionally,preclude the government from seeking the death penalty against them.
before making its rule determination,the district court had issued a separate discovery order on august,requiring the government to disclose its witness list days before trial,pursuant to.the government submitted a notice of noncompliance to the court.the government petitions for mandamus,seeking reversal of the discovery order.the government filed its mandamus petition more than days before the date on which the trial is scheduled to commence,so at the time of the filing the government had not yet violated the discovery order and the court had not yet imposed any sanction.

discussion 
jurisdiction 
as a preliminary matter,defendants argue that we lack jurisdiction to review the district court interpretation of the scope of rule.defendants assert that,because the government appealed the july,sanction order,the collateral bar rule precludes us from reviewing the district court underlying substantive ruling contained in the june order.that argument is foreclosed by our precedent,which permits an appeal on the merits in this situation.see united states fernandez,cir for while discovery orders themselves are not generally final for purposes of section,parties who face such an order have the option of making the decision final simply by refusing to comply,and appealing the resulting sanction.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we turn,therefore,to the merits of the government appeal.
this appeal presents the question whether investigative reports prepared by a local police department prior to a federal prosecutor involvement qualify for the discovery exemption created by rule a when they are turned over to the federal prosecutor for use in the federal investigation and prosecution of the same acts by the same people from the outset,it is important to note that this appeal does not involve the government disclosure obligations under brady maryland,d,or other disclosure rules.the identifying information here pertains to inculpatory,not exculpatory,evidence,and nothing in this opinion should be interpreted to diminish or dilute the government brady obligations.we review only the district court determination that local police reports do not qualify for the rule a exemption and that they are,therefore,discoverable materials under rule a e.this is an issue of first impression for our court.no constitutional or statutory provisions control the outcome,so we must begin by reviewing the text of rule.see united states john doe,d stating that an appellate court must look first to the plain meaning of the text when interpreting a federal rule of criminal procedure.
text of the rule 
rule a e sets out the types of information that the government must disclose to defendants during discovery 
upon a defendant request,the government must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or photograph documents if the item is within the government possession,custody,or control and 
i the item is material to preparing the defense 
ii the government intends to use the item in its at trial or 
iii the item was obtained from or belongs to the defendant.
emphasis added.rule a limits the scope of discoverable materials 
except as rule a provides otherwise,this rule does not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports,memoranda,or other internal government documents made by an attorney for the government or other government agent in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case.nor does this rule authorize the discovery or inspection of statements made by prospective government witnesses except as provided in.
emphasis added.
it is undisputed that the written police reports at issue here are documents within the possession,custody,or control of the federal prosecutor and that they are material to preparing the defense.thus,the reports are discoverable under rule a e unless exempted by rule a.we must decide whether the reports were made by an other government agent in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case.this inquiry requires us,in turn,to determine what is meant by government agent and the case.
government agent 
the rules do not define the phrase other government agent.although the constituent term government is not explicitly defined,it is used as shorthand for federal government throughout the rules in accordance with that construction,rule b defines restrictively the term attorney for the government to mean as relevant here a federal prosecutor 
even though government means federal government in rule a,we are still left to determine who qualifies as an agent of the federal government in the context of the discovery process in a federal criminal prosecution.defendants urge us to limit the concept of government agent to those individuals who were employed directly by the federal government or who were acting at the federal prosecutor direction at the time that they drafted a report.in contrast,the government urges that the term government agent be given a broader definition that would include state or local police officers whose investigation of a defendant provides evidence to support a federal prosecution of the same defendant for the activities so investigated.both readings are plausible,so we must look more deeply.
it is a general rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.gustafson alloyd,d internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we first examine the other parts of rule for guidance.rule a a and b both refer to a government agent.rule a a provides 
upon a defendant request,the government must disclose to the defendant the substance of any relevant oral statement made by the defendant,before or after arrest,in response to interrogation by a person the defendant knew was a government agent if the government intends to use the statement at trial.
emphasis added.as is true of rule a,the term government agent is not specifically defined in rule a a.but rule a a has been read to require federal prosecutors to disclose statements made by defendants to local law enforcement officers so long as such statements are in the federal prosecutor possession at the time of trial.see united states mitchell,cir holding that rule a a disclosure requirement applies to a statement made by the defendant to a state probation officer see also united states rinn,cir analyzing under rule a a the government failure to disclose the defendant statement to an undercover state police officer and holding that there was no violation,but only because the defendant statement was not in response to interrogation united states cooper,cir same,with regard to the defendant incriminating statements to a corrections officer united states brazel,cir holding that the government did not violate rule a a by failing to disclose the defendant guilty pleas before trial,where it disclosed them as soon as it gained possession.we have found no contradictory construction of rule a b.
the government proposed reading of government agent is consistent,then,with decisions implementing the same phrase in rule a a.even so,defendant narrower construction is still plausible.therefore,we look beyond rule for additional insight.
few of the rules address the kind of potential cooperation between federal and players raised in this appeal,so they offer little guidance in interpreting rule use of the term government agent.see supra note.federal rule of criminal procedure is one of the few rules,other than rule,that pertains to potential cooperation among federal,state,and local law enforcement.the commentary to rule assists us in understanding the advisory committee general concerns for a practical,cooperative approach.
rule governs federal grand jury proceedings.in establishing exceptions to the general rule of secrecy for grand jury proceedings,rule e allows disclosure to any government those of a state,state subdivision,indian tribe,or foreign an attorney for the government considers necessary to assist in performing that attorney duty to enforce criminal law.e a ii emphasis added.thus,government personnel is defined expressly to incorporate not only federal authorities,but also employees of government entities that are engaged in assisting federal criminal law enforcement.in explaining the rationale for this expansive definition,the advisory committee described concerns equally apropos to rule 
it is clearly desirable that federal and state authorities cooperate,as they often do,in organized crime and racketeering investigations,in public corruption and major fraud cases,and in various other situations where federal and state criminal jurisdictions overlap.because of such cooperation,government attorneys in complex grand jury investigations frequently find it necessary to enlist the help of a team of government agents.while the agents are usually federal personnel,it is not uncommon in certain types of investigations that federal prosecutors wish to obtain the assistance of state law enforcement personnel,which could be uniquely beneficial.the amendment permits disclosure to those personnel in the circumstances stated.
e a ii amendments advisory committee note.
although the advisory committee has not amended rule to include a similar or,indeed,any express definition of government agent,rule has not been subject to the type of conflict among district courts that prompted the advisory committee to amend rule the practical and policy considerations are parallel.we thus find it more reasonable that,read in context,government agent includes personnel whose work contributes to a federal criminal case.
defendants argue that,even if government agent is read to include local law enforcement officers,the police reports at issue here do not fall within the scope of rule a because they were prepared before the federal prosecutor initiated the case.in other words,defendants argue that,for the purposes of rule a,a case does not begin until a federal prosecutor becomes involved.again,the government urges a more expansive reading of the term that includes the investigative work done before a federal prosecutor takes on a federal prosecution,if the investigative work concerns a particular defendant and the particular conduct for which he is federally prosecuted.
defendants assert that the supreme court and our court have already addressed this question and have defined the case in the limited manner that defendants propose.to the contrary,the ambiguity of this term remains.indeed,the opinions that defendants cite actually weigh in favor of the government proposed definition.
in united states armstrong,d,the supreme court considered whether rule entitled the defendant to discovery for the purpose of gathering materials in support of a proposed counterclaim of selective prosecution against the federal prosecutors.the defendant sought a list of the racial identities of all defendants prosecuted federally for possession of drugs and firearms during a period.id.at.the court held that a defense to which the documents must be material means only an argument in response to the prosecution case in chief and,thus,did not include separate counterclaims such as selective prosecution.id.at.in arriving at that conclusion,the court stated that the term case,as used in rule a,does not extend to prosecutions against other people.id.
the logic of armstrong cuts against defendants proposed interpretation of case.in armstrong,the key question in determining the scope of a case under rule a was whether it involves the same defendant and the same crime.when state or local officials conduct an investigation that ultimately leads to a federal instead of a state prosecution against the same defendant for the very activities investigated,armstrong suggests that there is but one case against the defendant within the meaning of rule.this concept is particularly applicable in rico prosecutions where state crimes can be charged as predicate acts to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.
similarly,in united states,cir per curiam,we interpreted rule a to apply only to documents generated with a view toward the prosecution of a defendant.in,the defendant sought access to the training records of the dog that had alerted police to drugs in the gas tank of the defendant vehicle.id.at.we held that rule a did not except the training records from discovery because they were not made in connection with investigating or prosecuting this or any other case.id.at.
the clearest reading of supports the conclusion that documents that are made in connection with investigating or prosecuting this or any other case against a defendant are exempt from discovery under rule a.local police reports that result in a federal investigation or prosecution of the same defendant for the same acts are part of the case as so understood.
the continuing ambiguity of rule a,notwithstanding armstrong and,is illustrated by the conflicting approaches that district courts have taken in interpreting it.compare united states cherry,holding that,where the federal prosecution is a direct outgrowth of an investigation by local authorities,the local investigation and federal prosecution are one case,and the local police reports generated prior to federal involvement are exempt from discovery under rule a,and united states duncan,denying under rule a the defendant discovery request for all police reports related to his prosecution,with united states debacker,holding that,where state police began an investigation prior to federal involvement,police reports were discoverable under rule and united states green,however,to the extent that the government has in its possession reports or records from state or local law enforcement agencies or prisons,these items are discoverable unless they are the product of a joint investigation or unless they have become the work product of the federal investigators.
because the text of rule a remains ambiguous after considering its text and context,we turn to other interpretative aids to help resolve the question before us.
advisory committee intentions 
the advisory committee explanatory notes do not address the question presented here.we must,therefore,find indirect ways to understand the committee intent.
defendants contend that the drafters intended rule a to be a work product exception and,therefore,that we should limit the rule to the contours of the work product privilege codified in federal rule of civil procedure.we are not persuaded that the drafters meant to limit criminal rule to the civil work product doctrine.rule itself,while encompassing government work product and having its genesis in the idea of work product,draws its boundaries more broadly than those of civil rule 
it is true that rule a is often referred to as a work product rule.see.enactment advisory committee note d rules a and b define certain types of materials work product not to be discoverable.armstrong,at.stating that under rule a,the defendant may not examine government work product in connection with his case united states fernandez,cir additionally,rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure recognizes the work product privilege and exempts from production reports,memoranda,or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government or any other government agent investigating or prosecuting the case.
at the same time,it is clear that rule a protection of investigative materials extends beyond the work product privilege as defined in the civil context.although the advisory committee used the term work product to describe the materials discoverable under rule a,it purposefully defined the rule scope differently than that of rule.see.enactment advisory committee note 
as note d states,in the house of representatives proposed to limit the materials covered by criminal rule a to accord with civil rule.specifically,the house sought to exempt only the mental impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal theories of the attorney for the government or other government agents.id.the committee rejected that proposal and maintained the more expansive scope that includes all reports,memoranda,or other internal government documents.see also in re grand jury subpoenas,cir noting that rule imposes a stricter limit to discovery in criminal matters than rule imposes in civil litigation.
the fifth circuit in united states mann,cir,also has cautioned that rule is not coextensive with the work product privilege,despite their interrelatedness.the mann court expressly rejected the contention,raised by the defendants there and by defendants here,that the supreme court equated the two in united states nobles,d.mann,at.
although rule was an issue in nobles,the court addressed the work product doctrine separately from rule and did not equate them.at.the court comments regarding the work product doctrine are instructive in pointing to a practical interpretation 
at its core,the doctrine shelters the mental processes of the attorney,providing a privileged area within which he can analyze and prepare his client case.but the doctrine is an intensely practical one,grounded in the realities of litigation in our adversary system.one of those realities is that attorneys often must rely on the assistance of investigators and other agents in the compilation of materials in preparation for trial.it is therefore necessary that the doctrine protect material prepared by agents for the attorney as well as those prepared by the attorney himself.
mann distinction between the work product doctrine and rule a is further illustrated by the differing treatment of investigative reports.under the work product doctrine,police reports are rarely protected.see,miller pancucci,james moore et,moore federal practice c iii.but police reports at least those created by federal law enforcement officers plainly are protected under rule a.united states jordan,cir.thus,again,we can see that rule is not just a work product rule.
rather,the drafters intended rule a to be a rule of discovery,related to the work product doctrine but not synonymous or coextensive with it.therefore,we must go beyond the work product doctrine to determine the scope of rule a.
symmetry of obligations 
rule does not stand in isolation as the sole source of discovery obligations placed on parties to criminal litigation.instead,rule acts in concert with other statutory and common law obligations.
a.the jencks act 
the text of rule a delimits its own scope by reference to the jencks act nor does this rule authorize the discovery or inspection of statements made by prospective government witnesses except as provided in.the best clue that we have as to what the advisory committee that drafted rule intended regarding the scope of rule a exception is its reference in its committee note to two jencks cases,palermo united states,d and ogden united states,cir 
the jencks act requires the government to disclose to criminal defendants any statement made by a government witness that is in the possession of the united states once that witness has testified.a b emphasis added the act,in its current form,does not distinguish between statements obtained by federal officials and statements obtained by state or local officials.rather,the text of the statute requires that the government disclose all witness statements,regardless whether state obtained or federally obtained,so long as the statements are in the actual possession of the federal government at the time of the trial.see palermo,d describing jencks act disclosure requirements and making no distinction based on affiliation of official obtaining the statement ogden,same 
in cases relating to the jencks act,the key question posed by most courts is that of possession.for example,in united states higginbotham,cir,we addressed a defendant request that the federal prosecutors produce photographs that the state police had included in a photo array used to obtain witness identifications of the defendant.we held that the defendants did not have the right to production because the federal prosecutor never had possession of the photos.id.at.we analogized the case to a jencks act request 
t he demand to produce these photographs might well be likened to an attempt to require production under the jencks act of statements in the possession of state police.see beavers united states,cir,where the statements were never in possession of the united states and production was not required.
see also united states weaver,cir noting,in dictum,that the jencks act only applies to evidence in the possession of the united states,and not state authorities united states harris,finding no jencks act violation because,n otwithstanding the cooperative law enforcement effort of the federal and state authorities,the fact of the matter is that the reports in question were compiled by the city police officers,submitted as a matter of course to their superiors in the police department,and are now and were at the time of trial in the lawful possession and control of the philadelphia police department.we think that the drafters intended the same inquiry to be made here.
our case law supports a symmetrical reading of rule discovery obligations.in united states gatto,cir,we examined the scope of the prosecution duty to disclose evidence to the defendants under rule a e specifically,we were asked whether evidence found and held by state authorities until the eve of trial was discoverable to defendants under rule a e.we focused on physical possession as the dispositive factor.gatto,at.we held that the evidence became discoverable only when the state authorities placed it in the hands of the federal authorities,because the triggering requirement under rule a e is that the papers,documents,and tangible objects be in the actual possession,custody or control of the government.id.at.
gatto emphasis on possession as the triggering requirement for rule accords with decisions by this and other circuits.see,united states friedman,cir holding that neither rule nor the jencks act required the production of a document held by a foreign government,because the federal prosecutor did not have possession of it united states adkins,cir holding that rule a e predecessor require s the government only to turn over those records actually in its possession 
under gatto,evidence becomes subject to the disclosure obligation established by rule a e when it passes into federal possession.we believe that rule a is best read to create symmetry between the disclosure obligation and the exception to that obligation.rule a is,after all,an exception to the disgorgement requirement of rule a e,which depends on the document being within the government possession,custody,or control.in the context of this appeal,then,investigative reports created by state police officers and turned over to federal prosecutors to support a unified federal prosecution of defendants should be considered reports made by an other government agent in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case.
in addition to establishing symmetry between the government jencks act obligations and those imposed by rule,the government proposed reading of rule a creates symmetry between the treatment of like investigative reports created by investigating officers.rule a exempts reports created by fbi agents form from disclosure.jordan,at.
under defendants limited reading of the rule,parallel investigative reports created by state or local police officers would be treated differently for the purpose of discovery.the similar reports would be treated differently even if they were created in order to support a prosecution,turned over to federal prosecutors,and used by federal prosecutors in the preparation of a case.that asymmetry is illogical.symmetry is particularly compelling when evidence of state crimes such as drug dealing,robbery,and murder are predicate acts under rico to establish a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of federal law.
policy considerations 
finally,to determine the intent of the drafters of rule a,we examine policy considerations.in cherry,the district court for the southern district of new york addressed squarely the issue before us.it noted 
this federal prosecution is a direct outgrowth of investigations by local authorities.those investigations covered the same conduct by the same defendants charged in the federal indictment.for all practical purposes,including the application of rule a,this local investigation and federal prosecution should be considered one case.to hold otherwise,thereby making underlying local or state investigatory files subject to discovery by a subsequently federally indicted defendant,would in all likelihood inhibit cooperation between local and federal law enforcement agencies,to the benefit of criminals but to the detriment of the public good.
at footnotes omitted.those concerns are echoed here.
the present case involves the federal prosecution of defendants for,in part,gang activities in violation of rico.a number of the predicate acts on which the rico charge is based are state law crimes,including various counts of murder and attempted murder.it is precisely this type of case in which cooperation between state and federal law enforcement is most crucial.as we explained above,the advisory committee signaled the importance and desirability of cooperation when it explained changes to criminal rule.here,san francisco police officers investigated defendants illegal conduct and then turned the results of their investigation over to federal authorities,allowing their work to be subsumed within a single,unified prosecution of defendants by the federal authorities 
in conclusion,we hold that rule a extends to the san francisco police reports created prior to federal involvement but relinquished to federal prosecutors to support a unified prosecution of defendants for the same criminal activity that was the subject of the local investigation.it is an overstatement by the dissent to suggest that our opinion expands the scope of documents covered by rule and the jencks act.we here address witness statements to be used in a federal criminal prosecution but initially given to san francisco police officers along with the officers case reports revealing the identities of the witnesses and summarizing their statements.these types of documents have always been protected under federal law if compiled by federal officers.our opinion recognizes no principled reason why the law should be any different in a federal prosecution regardless of who gathered the statements 
notwithstanding its ruling that the police reports were discoverable under rule,the district court held,in the alternative,that the government had waived any potential rule a protection of the documents by turning over redacted copies of the reports to defendants.applying the principles of the work product privilege,the court held disclosure of privileged material waives the privilege as to all material on the same subject.
as we stated above,rule a is not,strictly speaking,a work product privilege.it is,rather,a broader rule of discovery.therefore,we look for guidance to the general principles of waiver.waiver is the intentional or voluntary relinquishment of a known right.black law dictionary ed.it can be either express or implied.id.
the fifth circuit discussion in mann analyzes a situation similar to the one we consider here.in mann,the government had allowed the defendants access to documents protected by rule a through an express agreement between the parties that the defendants would not copy the materials.at.the defendants broke the agreement,and the government rescinded access.id.the defendants the basis of validity of the government change of heart.they argued waiver as it applies to the work product privilege and cited nobles in support.id.at.the mann court held,first,that rule a and the work product privilege are not synonymous and that nobles did not make them so 
nobles,which was not concerned with rule a,can not be read to alter the plain language of a rule it did not address in short,we do not think that nobles expands the attorney work product privilege to other government agent internal reports,such as those contemplated in rule a.
id.applying general principles of waiver,the fifth circuit held that the government did not waive its rule a protection by allowing the defendants to have conditional access to the protected documents.id.at.
although the facts before us differ from those of mann in certain respects,we reach the same result.here,the government did not execute an express disclosure agreement.but it has clearly and consistently articulated its intention to preserve the confidentiality of identifications.it carried through on that intention with regard to the police reports by systematically redacting all witness locator information,while permitting defendants access to the substantive information contained within the reports.the government consistent and systematic retention of control over information demonstrates that it did not intentionally or voluntarily relinquish its rights under rule a to hold back this information from discovery.
we hold that the government disclosure of redacted copies of local police reports,where the redactions were consistent and supported by an articulated intention to protect witness identities in the context of a case in which the district court has already found a serious risk of harm to witnesses,does not constitute a waiver of the documents rule a protection.
expert use 
the district court also held,in the alternative,that the government had waived any potential rule a protection by allowing one of its experts to rely on the protected materials in developing his opinions.the government concedes that materials on which a proposed expert witness relies must be produced to defendants in discovery,and we agree.the government disputes,however,that the expert relied on the police reports at issue here.this is a question of fact that we remand to the district court for it to determine.
sanction appeal 
because we reverse the district court june discovery order,we also reverse its july,sanction order.consequently,we need not reach the government challenge to the sanction imposed by the district court.
we do not have jurisdiction over defendant of the july,sanction order.see united states eccles,cir a defendant may not from an interlocutory appeal under.
petition for mandamus 
finally,we turn to the government petition for mandamus,which challenges the district court august,order requiring the government to produce a list of witnesses days before trial,pursuant to given our ruling regarding the government discovery obligations under rule and the effect that this ruling will have on the overall management of discovery in this case,and given the fact that the time for compliance has not yet arrived,we decline to reach the merits of the government petition for mandamus at this time and,instead,remand all discovery issues to the district court for reconsideration.

i respectfully dissent.
the government seeks to use federal rule of criminal procedure a,which protects work product,to serve the purposes of rule d,which protects witnesses.the government is very open in stating that it seeks to protect its witnesses rather than its work product.in the first paragraph of its brief,it writes 
this combined appeal and petition arise out of a complex prosecution of twelve members of a violent street gang in san francisco,california c ivilian witness safety is a paramount concern in this prosecution.the legal issues presented by this brief are critically important for the protection of civilian witnesses.
the district court entered what it described as a very strong,muscular protective order.the government,however,is not satisfied with the protection this indeed any provide to its witnesses.the government writes that it firmly believes that no protective order,no matter how restrictive its terms,is sufficient to protect the safety and lives of these witnesses.for that reason,the government steadfastly refused to assist the district court in crafting any protective order that would require disclosure of the names or identifying information of witnesses at any time before trial.the district court finally said in frustration 
i gave you two opportunities to participate in the drafting process.i said,government,please,help me draft this protective order.you said no,you thumbed your nose at the court,and said,no,a thousand times no,we do want a protective order.that all you said.
ser tab,at 
the protective order entered by the district court in this case requires the government to make available to defendants counsel the unredacted names of prospective witnesses.the order then places severe restrictions on the use counsel may make of the names and any identifying information.up until days before trial,defendants counsel are strictly forbidden from disclosing to defendants any identifying information on protected witnesses either directly or indirectly.within days of trial,witness names and identifying information can be revealed to the defendants,subject to certain restrictions.neither the majority nor i address the government mandamus challenge to the district court requirement that names and identifying information be turned over within days of trial.
the government has refused to comply with the district court order.specifically,it has refused to provide witness names or identifying information contained in police reports prepared by officers of the san francisco police department.the government contends that these reports are protected as government work product under rule a,even though the reports were prepared long before it had any involvement with the investigation and prosecution of these defendants.despite its claim that the entire reports are protected as work product under rule a,the government is willing to hand them over after redaction.but it insists that rule a allows it to redact names and identifying information.
the government and the majority misunderstand and therefore misuse rule a.rule a is designed to protect only the government work product in connection with a criminal case u nder rule a,a defendant may not examine government work product in connection with his case.united states armstrong,d emphasis added.because the reports in question are the work product of the san francisco police department,not of the government,they are not protected by rule a.to the extent the government is concerned about the safety of its witnesses,its remedy is a protective order under rule d.
federal rule of criminal procedure deals with pretrial discovery in federal criminal cases.rule was adopted in the view that broad discovery contributes to the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice by providing the defendant with enough information to make an informed decision as to plea by minimizing the undesirable effect of surprise at the trial and by otherwise contributing to an accurate determination of the issue of guilt or innocence.advisory committee note amendment see also united states howell,cir.
notwithstanding the goal of broad discovery,two subsections of rule a and b carve out information not subject to disclosure by the government and the defendant respectively.as the advisory note to rule explains,these subsections set forth work product exceptions to the general discovery requirements.advisory committee note enactment see also armstrong,at.united states fernandez,cir rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure recognizes the work product privilege.because rule a,which protects the government work product,is an exception to the disclosure provisions that comprise the greater part of rule a,the exception must be construed narrowly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision.comm r clark,d.

statutory interpretation begins with the text of the statute or rule.united states hoffman,cir interpreting rule.the plain meaning of a statute or rule is controlling absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary.id.at.we presume that identical words used in different parts of the same rule are intended to have the same meaning.gustafson alloyd,d internal quotation marks omitted.ordinarily,a rule should be interpreted to give effect to every clause and word contained in it.see negonsott samuels,d moskal united states,d.in considering plain meaning,it is necessary to keep in mind the context of particular language and the structure of the statute or rule as a whole.see davis.dep t of treasury,d it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.
rule a requires the government to turn over certain things to the defendant in advance of trial.pertinent to this case,rule a e requires the government,upon request,to permit the defendant to inspect and to copy documents if the item is within the government possession,custody,or control and the item is material to preparing the defense.the government has conceded that the police reports in question are documents within the meaning of rule a e.
rule a provides a exception to the obligation imposed under rule a e.see united states,cir majority op.at.in relevant part,rule a provides 
t his rule does not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports,memoranda,or other internal government documents made by an attorney for the government or other government agent in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case.
bracketed numbers and emphasis added.the meaning of rule a is so plain that it should be unnecessary to do anything more than simply to read the text in order to conclude that it does not protect documents prepared by the san francisco police department without any involvement by the federal government.but because the majority concludes otherwise,i engage in a detailed analysis of the text.
rule a contains three phrases that have particular relevance to this case.these are the numbered italicized phrases above internal government documents,made by,and an attorney for the government or other government agent.i discuss each in turn.
internal government documents 
rule a limits the information it protects to reports,memoranda,or other internal government documents.emphasis added.internal government documents are a subclass of documents within the government possession,custody,or control that must otherwise be produced under rule a e.the oxford english dictionary ed defines internal as p ertaining to the inner nature or relations of anything,as distinguished from its relations to things external to itself.id.at.we have previously held that the term government in rule,as used in relation to documents within the government possession,custody,or control,refers to the federal government.united states gatto,cir see also united states,cir.the majority concedes that the term government,as it is used throughout rule a,refers to the federal government.majority op.at government means federal government in rule a.internal government documents are therefore documents pertaining to the inner nature or relations of the federal government,as distinguished from its relations to things external to itself.documents generated outside the federal government without federal involvement for purposes are not internal government documents within the meaning of the rule.
rule a further requires that the documents be made by a federal government attorney or other government agent.the oxford english dictionary defines made as produced or obtained by making as distinguished from other modes of origin or acquisition.id.at.documents can not be made by federal government attorneys or agents if they are made by someone else.the phrase made by,like internal government,thus signals that documents protected from disclosure by rule a are a subclass of the broader class of documents within the government possession,custody,or control described in rule a e.
an attorney for the government or other government agent 
finally,internal government documents must be made by an attorney for the government or other government agent.it is undisputed that the police reports at issue were not made by an attorney.rather,they were made by officers of the san francisco police department.the question is whether the san francisco police officers who made the reports were other government agents within the meaning of rule a.to answer this question,we must determine the meaning of the terms government and agent,and the function of the modifier other.
government 
the term government refers to the federal government in rule a,as conceded by the majority.
the term agent encompasses only a person who acts with the authority or apparent authority of the principal.black law dictionary defines agent as o ne who is authorized to act for or in the place of another.black law dictionary ed emphasis added.to authorize is to give legal authority to empower to formally approve to sanction.id.at.the term agent is sufficiently broad to encompass state or local law enforcement personnel working alongside,or on behalf of,the federal government,as in a cooperative joint investigation.however,the term does not encompass state and local personnel who at the time of their actions had no authority,real or apparent,from the federal government.that is,the term agent requires prior or contemporaneous authorization of the agent by the federal government.
reading the term agent to require prior or contemporaneous authorization is consistent with other uses of that term in rule.for example,rule a c speaks of persons who are legally able to bind the defendant regarding the subject of a statement or conduct because of that person position as the defendant director,officer,employee,or agent.emphasis added.this passage mirrors the ordinary definition of agent as o ne who is authorized to act for or in the place of another.in united states taylor,cir,the eleventh circuit employed this definition of agent under rule a a.the court held that a former cellmate of the defendant,who wrote a letter to the government six months before trial describing the defendant purported jailhouse confession,was not,at any time,a government agent under rule.id.at.
there is clear symmetry between rules a and b.both sections employ virtually identical language when describing the protected work product of the government rule a and the defendant rule b.rule b allows the defendant to refuse to disclose reports,memoranda,or other documents made by the defendant,or the defendant attorney or agent,during the case investigation or defense,as well as certain statements made to the defendant,or the defendant attorney or agent.in interpreting rule,the supreme court has been guided by perceptible symmetr ies in its language.armstrong,at.the majority does not even mention rule b,let alone consider the implications for that section of its broad reading of agent in rule a.if making and later giving a document to the federal government can make a person a government agent within the meaning of rule a,virtually all of the materials that would otherwise be required by rule a to be disclosed can be protected from disclosure by the mere act of giving them to the government.i would be very surprised if the majority would embrace a symmetrical reading of rule b,in which the same definition of agent would provide a criminal defendant the same ability to avoid disclosure of documents otherwise required to be disclosed under rule a.
the natural reading of the phrase other government agent is that it means any agent of the federal government other than an attorney for the government.see.b defining attorney for the government as an attorney employed or authorized by the federal government.however,the government argues that the word other modifies only the word government rather than the phrase government agent.under the government reading,other government agent means agent of some government other than the federal government.if we read other government agent to mean agent for another government,as the government suggests,there would still be protection for the work of an attorney for the government.but there would be no protection for the work of any other agent of the federal government.that is,under the government reading,there would be no protection for documents prepared by an fbi agent working on a federal criminal case.this is manifestly absurd.i am confident that the government would not argue for this reading of other government agent in a case where documents made by an fbi agent were at issue.see united states jordan,cir.
conclusion 
i conclude from the foregoing that reports made by members of the san francisco police department,long before the involvement of the federal government in the investigation and prosecution of the defendants in this case,are not protected work product under the plain meaning of rule a.
iii.majority arguments 
the majority makes a number of arguments to escape from the plain meaning of rule a.i address them in turn.
meaning of government agent in rule a 
the majority argues that other government agent in rule a should be given the same meaning as government agent in rule a.in relevant part,rule a provides 
a defendant oral statement.upon a defendant request,the government must disclose to the defendant the substance of any relevant oral statement made by the defendant,before or after arrest,in response to interrogation by a person the defendant knew was a government agent if the government intends to use the statement at trial.
b defendant written or recorded statement.upon a defendant request,the government must disclose to the defendant 
ii the portion of any written record containing the substance of any relevant oral statement made before or after arrest if the defendant made the statement in response to interrogation by a person the defendant knew was a government agent.
emphasis added.one court of appeals has held,without discussion,that government agent,as used in rule a,includes an agent of a state or local government.see united states mitchell,cir.other courts of appeals,including our own,have treated state or local police officers as government agents under rule a,but only in the context of cooperative activity.see united states cooper,cir official at prison housing district of columbia and federal prisoners united states rinn,cir local police officers cooperating in a joint investigation financed by the drug enforcement agency.
for two reasons,i disagree with the majority argument.first,the majority argument is,in effect,an argument that the word government in the phrase other government agent in rule a means any government,whether federal,state,or local.but the majority has explicitly disavowed this interpretation of the term government in rule a.two paragraphs before it argues for a parallel interpretation of the term government agent in rule a and other government agent in rule a,the majority writes that government means federal government in rule a.majority op.at.
second,the functions of rules a and a are entirely different.rule a imposes a broad discovery obligation on the government.as we wrote in howell,rule was intended to facilitate the broad discovery needed for the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice.at quoting.advisory committee note amendment.the history of amendments to rule makes clear the fundamental importance attached by the rulemakers to broad discovery and avoidance of unfair surprise.see.advisory committee note amendment the rule has been revised to expand the scope of pretrial discovery.id.amendment rule is revised to give greater discovery to both the prosecution and the defense.id.enactment the committee believes that it is desirable to promote greater pretrial discovery.id.amendment the amendment expands slightly government disclosure id.amendment new subdivisions expand federal criminal discovery.one of the objectives of rule is to eliminate the idea that a criminal trial is a sporting contest in which the game of cat and mouse is acceptable.howell,at.it is thus at least consistent with the purpose of rule to read rule a broadly to include a requirement that the federal government disclose to a defendant any prior statement made by that defendant to a law enforcement official,whether that statement was made to a federal,state,or local official.
by contrast,rule a is a exception to the broad disclosure requirement imposed by rule a,which we read narrowly to preserve the operation of the provision to which it is an exception.clark,at.rule a protects only the work product of the federal government.it therefore makes sense that the phrase other government agent in rule a be read to refer only to agents of the federal government whose work product is being protected.if rule a were read more broadly to protect documents made by state or local law enforcement officials,the rule would be protecting the work product of a state or local government as well as the work product of the federal government.
parallel to rule 
notwithstanding its concession that the term government means federal government in rule a,the majority argues that the text of federal rule of criminal procedure e indicates the term might include state and local government.rule e a ii carves out a limited exception to grand jury secrecy by allowing an attorney for the government to disclose matter to any government those of a state or state subdivision,indian tribe,or foreign government if necessary to assist in performing that attorney duty to enforce federal criminal law.emphasis added.the rules advisory committee added the italicized language in after some district courts held that the phrase government personnel did not include state or local officials cooperating with federal attorneys.advisory committee note amendment united states pimental,cir.
ordinary rules of statutory construction demand that the term government not be interpreted to mean the same thing as the phrase any government including a state or state subdivision,indian tribe,or foreign government.see negonsott,at.moskal,at.in fact,rule e a ii itself shows that if the rules advisory committee intended rule a to protect the work product of state and local,as well as federal,law enforcement officers,it knew very well how to express that intent.see united states,d where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.the committee has likely declined to amend rule a because the phrase government agent means exactly what the committee and congress intend it to agent of the federal government.
parallel to protection of work product in civil cases 
the majority argues that we need not read rule a narrowly because it is not just a work product rule.majority op.at.as the majority concedes,however,the rules advisory committee,the supreme court,other courts of appeals,and our own court have all characterized rule a as a exception.see.advisory committee note enactment armstrong,at.fernandez,at in re grand jury subpoenas,cir virgin islands fahie,cir velsicol chem.parsons,cir united states fallen,cir.
neither the language nor history of rule a suggests that the rulemakers intended to expand its protection beyond traditional work is,protection of materials made by a party or its agent in connection with litigation,including,but not limited to,mental impressions,conclusions,opinions,and legal theories.the text of rule a,the criminal exception,differs somewhat from that of federal rule of civil procedure b,the civil exception.but the important difference between the criminal and civil rules lies not in the types of materials they protect,but rather in the fact that the criminal rule,unlike the civil rule,protects against the disclosure of work product even upon a showing of need.see.b holmgren state farm mut.auto.ins,cir in re cendant.sec,cir in re grand jury subpoenas,cir.there is nothing in the two rules to suggest that they define differently the government and its agents in describing the scope of the government work product.
the majority argues that the protection of rule a should be read symmetrically with other discovery obligations under rule.the majority takes this term from armstrong,in which the supreme court construed the version of rule a c symmetrically.armstrong,at.the defendant had sought to prove selective prosecution by the government,and had accordingly sought discovery of documents in other cases brought by the government.the defendant relied on his entitlement,under rule a c,to documents which are within the possession,custody or control of the government,and which are material to the preparation of the defendant defense or are intended for use by the government as evidence in chief at the trial.a c emphasis added.the court held that these documents were not discoverable,concluding that the defendant defense,within the meaning of rule a c,was symmetrical to the government evidence in chief.armstrong,at.since the defense of selective prosecution would not be presented as responsive to the government case in chief,information material to that defense was not discoverable at trial.
i agree with the majority that symmetry is relevant to the construction of rule.but the majority seeks to create symmetry where none should exist.worse,it ignores the symmetry that clearly does exist.i first respond to the majority erroneous symmetry arguments.i then point out the symmetry that the majority ignores.
the majority symmetry arguments 
a.the jenks act and rule a e 
the majority argues that because physical possession is the dispositive factor in determining whether material is discoverable under the jencks act and rule a e,symmetry requires that it also be the test for whether documents are excepted from discovery under the protection of rule a.majority op.at.this argument ignores the plain language of rule a,which protects only internal documents made by the federal government.on its face,this category of documents is not coterminous with documents in the possession jencks act,or possession,custody,or control rule a e,of the federal government.rather,it represents a narrower subset of them.
moreover,the result of the majority argument is absurd.like rule a a,the jencks act and rule a e are discovery rules requiring disclosure.by contrast,rule a is an exception to a rule requiring disclosure.reading an exception so that its scope is identical to the rule that it modifies makes no sense.in that event,the exception entirely obliterates the rule.this is why the supreme court has counseled not that exceptions be read as symmetrical to rules,but rather that they be read narrowly.clark,at.
fbi form reports 
the majority argues that it would create an asymmetry to protect form reports made by fbi agents under rule a,but not to protect similar reports created by state or local police officers.majority op.at.this difference in treatment is,indeed,an asymmetry.but it is one clearly contemplated by the protection of rule a.the difference in treatment between fbi reports and state and local police reports reflects the distinction,fundamental to the exception,between documents made by a party or its agent,which are protected,and documents created by a,which are not.the purpose of the give parties freedom and incentive to develop their own cases,see united states nobles,d simply is not promoted by shielding from discovery materials in an attorney possession that were prepared neither by the attorney nor his agents.in re grand jury subpoenas,at.
symmetry argument ignored by the majority 
the majority ignores the obvious symmetry between rule a and the parallel provision in rule b.rule a protects the work product of the government.rule b protects the work product of the defendant.in relevant part,rule a protects against the discovery or inspection of reports,memoranda,or other internal government documents made by an attorney for the government or other government agent in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case.in relevant part,rule b protects against discovery or inspection of reports,memoranda,or other documents made by the defendant,or the defendant attorney or agent,during the case investigation or defense.that rule a and rule b share nearly identical texts is consistent with the rulemakers broader intent that rule create reciprocal discovery rights and obligations between the government and the defendant.see.advisory committee note,and amendments.
symmetry demands that if the government is allowed,under rule a,to refuse to disclose any document that comes into its possession,custody,or control,regardless whether it was made by a federal agent,defendants should be afforded comparable protection from disclosure by rule b.but i find it difficult to believe that either the government or the majority would support such a symmetrical reading where documents in the possession of the defense are at issue and are otherwise discoverable under rule.
conclusion 
the government is very appropriately concerned in this case about the safety of prospective witnesses.but the witness protection problem can not be solved by reading the exception in rule a so broadly that it effectively obliterates the discovery mandated by rule a.as the government and the majority read rule a,the rule protects virtually all documents now in the possession of the government,whether or not those documents were made by agents of the federal government,and whether or not those documents endanger the safety of any witnesses.under the majority reading,it is enough that the documents be relevant to the case,and that they have been given to and are in the possession of the federal government.
the government has emphasized throughout this case,both in the district court and here,that it is concerned about witness safety.rule includes a provision that is much better suited for the protection of witnesses than the rule.that provision is rule d protective and modifying orders,under which the court may a t any time for good cause,deny,restrict,or defer discovery or inspe
