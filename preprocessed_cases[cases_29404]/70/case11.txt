the appellant,assistant federal public defender joannie plaza martínez,challenges a monetary sanction imposed for what the court below termed a lack of candor.her appeal requires us to jump a jurisdictional hurdle and,once that hurdle has been cleared,to evaluate the propriety of the sanction.after careful consideration,we find the sanction insupportable.
the stage can easily be set.in the district court,the appellant acted as counsel for juan felix santiago rivera,a criminal defendant who pleaded guilty to a number of charges arising out of a violent carjacking.the relevant facts anent santiago rivera offense can be gleaned from our opinion rejecting his appeal from the sentence imposed.see united states santiago rivera,cir,slip op.at.
after santiago rivera entered a guilty plea,the court,on august,notified both sides that a disposition hearing would take place on december.on the day before the scheduled hearing,the appellant moved for a continuance and requested that the hearing be reset for a date subsequent to january.as the ground for her motion,the appellant represented that she could not attend the scheduled sentencing because it conflicted with the commencement of a trial in another criminal case before a different judge as matters turned out,she had not yet entered an appearance in the second case although she did so shortly after filing the continuance motion.
the district court denied the motion,indicating that the appellant could attend jury selection in the second case after santiago rivera sentencing.the appellant responded by renewing her motion for a continuance and reiterating the conflict between the scheduled proceedings in the two cases.the court denied the renewed motion and,without any prior notice,fined the appellant as a monetary sanction.
to explain this sanction,the court stated in a minute order that the appellant had not been candid with the court.the court made two related observations.first,it remarked that the appellant had entered her appearance in the second case subsequent to requesting a continuance of santiago rivera sentencing.second,it remarked that a different assistant federal public defender previously had engaged in similar conduct the court warned that if such a conflict arose again,more severe sanctions would ensue.
later that day,the appellant filed an ex parte motion for reconsideration,seeking not only the previously requested continuance but also vacation of the monetary sanction.the appellant offered to provide the court with a case history report regarding the second case,noting that the report would explain in detail her significant level of involvement with that case in her capacity as supervisor of the federal public defender litigation section.this filing made pellucid that the appellant had been involved for months in the second case.
the next day,the district court convened santiago rivera sentencing hearing.before turning to sentencing,the court resolved the appellant motion for reconsideration.it stated that if the appellant had put all of this in her original motion,it may have done something else and that another situation would have occurred.nevertheless,the court refused to vacate the sanction.it did,however,continue santiago rivera sentencing to january.
the day before that hearing,assistant federal public defender héctor ramos vega filed a further ex parte motion for reconsideration of the sanctions order.the motion papers included a timekeeping report,which substantiated the appellant claim that she had been working on the second criminal matter well before she filed her notice of appearance.the court summarily denied this motion.it sentenced santiago rivera on the following day.
a single notice of appeal was filed.by means of this one notice,santiago rivera sought to appeal his sentence and the appellant sought to appeal the sanctions order and the denial of her motions for reconsideration.the notice of appeal was unarguably proper as to santiago rivera claims of error,and we resolved those claims in an earlier opinion.when we affirmed santiago rivera sentence,we held in abeyance the appellant separate claim of error.see santiago rivera,at,slip op.at.
there is an unresolved jurisdictional question concerning the appellant separate claim of error can a lawyer obtain appellate review of a sanctions order by on her client notice of appeal although neither side has voiced any concern about this conundrum,a court is to notice,and act upon,defects in its subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte.spooner een,cir.accordingly,we must undertake to determine whether we have jurisdiction over the appellant claim.
there is no doubt but that the better practice is for an attorney who wishes to challenge a sanctions order directed at him or her to file a separate notice of appeal.see charles wright arthur miller et,federal practice and procedure ed.this is not to say,however,that the better practice is the only acceptable practice.
federal rule of appellate procedure generally governs the procedural formalities incident to the taking of appeal.under the amendments to the rule,an appeal should not be dismissed if it is clear from the notice that the party intended to appeal.fed,advisory committee note to subdivision c.with this admonition in mind,we hold that we have jurisdiction over a claim of error made by a lawyer who,rather than filing a separate notice of appeal to challenge a sanction imposed in the course of a case,on the client notice of appeal provided,however,that the notice of appeal unambiguously manifests the lawyer intention to appeal the sanction.
this holding is consistent with our decision in lamboy ortiz ortiz vélez,cir,in which we concluded,in analogous circumstances,that the lawyer intent to appeal the sanction was evident from the face of the notice of appeal and should be honored.see id.moreover,the assertion of jurisdiction here is consistent with our policy of affording liberal construction to rule.see,id.at in re spookyworld,cir.asserting jurisdiction is also consistent with the views of other courts.see,laurino tate,cir.
in the case at hand,the notice of appeal named the appellant along with santiago rivera in the caption.in addition,the body of the notice of appeal made manifest the appellant intention to challenge the sanctions order.it memorialized in no uncertain terms the appellant intent to appeal from the order of the district court imposing sanctions.under these circumstances,we have jurisdiction to hear and determine the appellant claim of error.
we turn next to the merits.the court below did not describe the basis of its authority for imposing the challenged sanction,but the circumstances make plain that the sanction was imposed under its inherent power.see united states romero lópez,cir.in general,a court may levy such a sanction upon finding that a party has acted in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly,or for oppressive reasons,cooperativa de seguros de vida de,cir quoting chambers nasco.when such a sanction is challenged,we review its imposition for abuse of discretion.see chambers,at romero lópez,at.
we recognize that trial judges have appreciable leeway in managing their crowded dockets and in determining the appropriateness of sanctions.even so,a judge power to sanction an attorney is not unbridled.united states figueroa arenas,cir.the need for restraint is uppermost when a judge is considering the imposition of sanctions on defense counsel in a criminal case in such a situation,the judge must bear in mind such counsel important constitutional function.united states agosto vega,cir.it is,therefore,a bedrock proposition that sanctions,though an available weapon in a trial judge armamentarium,should not be deployed so as to chill vigorous but legitimate advocacy in a criminal case.figueroa arenas,f d at.
here,the district court stated basis for its sanctions order was the appellant ostensible lack of candor.the record does not support such a finding.
to begin,the term not candid implies a misrepresentation or,at least,a withholding of pertinent information.see,random house dictionary of the english language ed defining candid as frank outspoken open
