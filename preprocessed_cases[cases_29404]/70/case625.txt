mettler toledo,mettler filed suit accusing btek scales,llc b tek of infringing claims of patent patent and patent.after the district court construed the claims,a jury determined that the claims of the patent were not infringed and that the claims of the patent were both not infringed and invalid.mettler appeals the district court denial of judgment as a matter of law jmol for each of these determinations.because the district court correctly construed the claims of the patent and because substantial evidence supports the jury verdict of invalidity of the patent,we affirm.
cross appellant b tek appeals the district court denial of sanctions for alleged withholding and destruction of relevant documents.because the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the documents were not highly relevant and that there was little harm to b tek,we affirm.
background 
the and patents relate to technology for weighing objects,such as large commercial trucks.the patent describes an individual load cell that is one of several cells used in a scale.the cell produces an electrical signal in response to being deformed by an external force such as an object to be weighed.the patent describes a system and method for measuring the weight of moveable objects on a scale.specifically,the patent discloses a system for correcting weight measurements based on the location of objects on a scale.for example,an object placed at one end of a scale may exert more pressure on the weight sensors positioned at that end than an identical object placed in the center.the patent describes correcting for this load position so that the same total weight will be determined regardless of the placement of the object.
mettler sued b tek alleging infringement of certain claims of the and patents.the district court construed the claims and the case proceeded to trial where the jury found that b tek did not infringe any of the asserted claims of the and patents.the jury also determined that the asserted claims of the patent would have been obvious.mettler filed a motion for jmol on both the infringement and invalidity issues,which the court denied.mettler appeals the district court denial of its motion for jmol for both patents.btek cross appeals the district court denial of sanctions.we have jurisdiction under a.

the patent describes a load cell for measuring a force.patent ll.the cell utilizes a counterforce attached to a circuit board illustrated in figure 
the circuit includes strain gauges,and which,via a bridge circuit,create an analog electrical signal related to an object weight.id.ll.this analog signal is converted to a digital signal by multiple slope integrating converter.id.ll.this digital signal is then sent to microprocessor.id.ll.claim is illustrative of the asserted claims 
weighing apparatus comprising a counterforce,transducer means mounted on said counterforce,circuit means associated with said counterforce,said circuit means being responsive to external control and including means for producing digital representations of loads applied to said counterforce,
means for applying at least one correction factor to said digital representations and means for transmitting said digital representations,
means providing a sealed enclosure for said transducer means and said circuit means,
means providing a path through said enclosure means for external communication with said circuit means.
the district court construed a number of the claim terms including the terms in dispute circuit means associated with said counterforce,said circuit means being responsive to external control,means for producing digital representations of loads applied to said counterforce,and means for transmitting said digital representations.it held that,for each of these terms,the associated structure in the specification includes the multiple slope integrating converter,and equivalents thereof.for example,for the term means for producing digital representations of loads applied to said counterforce,the district court held that the corresponding structure was a multiple slope integrating converter,and equivalents thereof.mettler toledo,fairbanks scales,d.
in the accused products,the converter is a deltasigma converter.the jury determined that the accused products did not infringe either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.in its jmol motion,mettler argued that the converter is equivalent to the multiple slope integrating converter.the district court held that substantial evidence supported the jury verdict that they were not equivalent pointing to trial testimony by b tek expert and a corporate representative from another defendant that there are substantial differences between the two types of converters.
on appeal,mettler limits its arguments to a single claim construction issue whether the district court improperly construed the relevant claim terms to require a multiple slope integrating converter rather than any generic converter.mettler argues that the district court erred by importing the structure of only the preferred embodiment or best mode of the disclosure into the claim.it contends that converters are in the art and that there was no reason to limit the structure to only the multiple slope integrating converter.it further points to figure that illustrates an analog to digital converter.it argues that this shows that the specification discloses generic converters as well as the more specific multiple slope integrating embodiment.mettler contends that the abstract,by mentioning a generic converter,supports its broad construction.finally,mettler points out that the district court applied a different construction for the patent,holding that a generic converter is included in the claim term construction.it argues that the two patent specifications are very similar and both disclose a generic converter linked to the claimed functions.
citing medical instrumentation diagnostics elekta ab,b tek responds that the patent never links a generic converter to the claimed functions.it points out that the converter shown in figure is only referred to in the specification as multiple slope integrating converter.patent ll.it argues that every mention of a converter in the specification refers back to this specific type of converter.
we agree with the district court that the appropriate structure for the disputed claim elements in the patent is the multiple slope integrating converter and equivalents thereof.our case law is clear that a claim limitation is limited to the structures disclosed in the specification and equivalents.med.instrumentation diagnostics,at.a court must look to the specification to determine the structures that correspond to the claimed function.s tructure disclosed in the specification is corresponding structure only if the specification or prosecution history clearly links or associates that structure to the function recited in the claim.braun med.abbott.if a patentee chooses to disclose a single embodiment,then any claim limitation will be limited to the single disclosed structure and equivalents thereof.see nomos brainlab.
