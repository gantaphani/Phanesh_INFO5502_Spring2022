this case concerns an abortive effort by one group of investors,collectively known as the lincoln company,to acquire hartmarx corporation hartmarx.shortly after lincoln publicly announced its intention to pursue an acquisition,hartmarx filed suit,claiming that lincoln had violated e of the securities exchange act of,e,by failing to commence its anticipated tender offer within a reasonable period of time and by making false and misleading statements concerning their financing for the proposed deal.ugly litigation ensued,with denials,and a string of publicly released letters.
lincoln ultimately terminated its acquisition efforts,but the litigation continued.without finding liability under e,the district court conditioned dismissal of the action on lincoln issuance of a corrective release concerning the alleged misstatements.on its second try,lincoln complied with that order,and the action was dismissed.relying on the private securities litigation reform act pslra,c,which incorporates fed.civ,the district court then imposed sanctions against lincoln in the amount of for the alleged misrepresentations and for bringing frivolous counterclaims.lincoln now appeals that award.we conclude that lincoln statements and actions did not run so far afoul of the governing standards under the tender offer rules that sanctions were warranted.we therefore reverse that order and remand for correction of the judgment.
on august,a group including the tom james company,its chairman spencer hays,and robert abboud,a former director of hartmarx,which together had created the lincoln company as a vehicle for their investments,sent a public letter to the directors of hartmarx stating an intention to execute a future cash tender offer for all of hartmarx outstanding stock beyond the it already owned.in that letter,lincoln stated,the lincoln company,llc,which is the investor group we have assembled,is made up of the tom james company and other investors,who have committed million in cash equity for this transaction.lincoln then added that we have arranged financing to cover the purchase,refinance the existing hartmarx debt and provide for the working capital needs of the company.the press release was simultaneously filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on a schedule to form.
with its stock price rising,hartmarx refused to meet with lincoln representatives and instead issued its own public letter,dated august,demanding details of lincoln financing.lincoln responded by public letter on august proposing that a confidentiality agreement should be executed before financing details could be provided.hartmarx offered a written proposal for such an agreement,but the parties were unable to agree on the details.in a september press release,hartmarx declared that it would not meet with lincoln because lincoln was being too secretive.
that same day,hartmarx filed suit claiming that lincoln conduct violated e of the act.among other things,hartmarx alleged that lincoln had violated e by failing to commence its proposed tender offer within a reasonable period of time of the august release and by making false and misleading statements in the release and the corresponding schedule to concerning its supposed financing for the deal and its intent to proceed with an offer.hartmarx complaint requested the issuance of a corrective press release stating that defendants do not presently have the necessary financing commitments to complete the offer,an injunction preventing lincoln from proceeding with a tender offer until such corrections had been made,and an order that lincoln had to commence any tender offer by a time specified by the district court.
lincoln filed its answer on september.it claimed that neither the press release nor the schedule to communicated any intent to commence a tender offer.furthermore,it asserted that the august communication did not constitute an actual tender offer at all under sec rule.lincoln also denied hartmarx allegation that it had not arranged financing for the deal.finally,it filed counterclaims and a complaint against hartmarx and certain of its directors,claiming breach of fiduciary duties and misrepresentation under e for claiming that lincoln lacked financing.
on september,hartmarx moved for judgment on the pleadings.lincoln responded in two ways.first,it provided hartmarx counsel with a number of letters providing further details about its financing arrangements,which showed a mix of written and oral commitments including million from bank of america,million of equity and million of debt from stephens group,and million of equity from tom james company and abboud.two days later,lincoln filed an amended answer and counterclaim.at that point,it said that w hile the form of the ultimate transaction may change to include a cash merger or other mechanism,it has been and continues to be lincoln intent to commence and complete a tender offer under certain conditions.it also claimed that it had proper financing for such an offer.the conditions to which it referred included regulatory approval and the hartmarx board retraction of a poison pill defense mechanism.lincoln deleted its defense that the august press release did not constitute a tender offer under sec rule.
at a september hearing,the court held that lincoln amended pleadings rendered moot hartmarx motion for judgment on the pleadings.the court added,however,that lincoln earlier admissions,while fully superseded by the amended pleadings,still constituted evidentiary admissions.both parties indicated their intention to file a motion for summary judgment.
on september,hartmarx filed its written motion for summary judgment.that motion argued that the financing details provided by lincoln conclusively showed that lincoln august release contained misrepresentations about its financing,that they were securely in place when they were that lincoln had acted knowingly or recklessly in issuing public statements.for instance,the bank of america financing letter was dated september,some days after the tender offer announcement,but lincoln did not execute it until september.the stephens group financing letter was dated september,some days after the tender offer,and lincoln had not yet executed it.lincoln,despite its statement at the september hearing,chose not to file its own motion for summary judgment.instead,it publicly revealed the source documents evidencing its financing agreements.these documents had been delivered to hartmarx on september under a protective order.lincoln also publicly stated that if hartmarx would not consent to a meeting by october,it would cease all acquisition efforts.
on september,hartmarx moved separately to dismiss lincoln counterclaims,including the e claims for hartmarx alleged misrepresentations about lincoln supposed lack of financing.hartmarx did not address the merits of the fiduciary duty claims.it argued instead that the district court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction because of pending actions in delaware chancery court.
lincoln made good on its threat to withdraw its offer on october,but proceedings nonetheless continued in the district court.this prompted lincoln to file a motion to dismiss for mootness on october,in which it offered to dismiss its own counterclaims in return for hartmarx dismissal of its claims.at an october hearing,the district court expressed the opinion that the documents indicated that the august press release contained misrepresentations as to financing.moreover,the district court said that even lincoln mootness motion contained untruthful or misleading statements about the state of lincoln financing throughout the contest.as a result,the district court denied lincoln motion to dismiss and ordered lincoln to cure its misstatements as a service to lawsuits in other jurisdictions,most notably delaware.
lincoln complied with the court order and issued a new press release on october acknowledging that at the time of the august press release it had only oral agreements for financing from the tom james company and robert abboud,oral indications from the kps special situation fund and the stephens group,and an unexecuted commitment letter from suntrust capital markets.it indicated that it had also engaged in preliminary discussions with bank of america,though a commitment letter was not drafted until after the august release.lincoln conceded that its financing arrangements did not expressly provide for the acquisition of hartmarx through a tender offer,and further characterized the entire contest as more of a negotiated acquisition that,with appropriate financing arrangements,might have ultimately taken the form of a tender offer.upon publication of the october corrective release,the district court dismissed the action.
on october,hartmarx filed a motion for attorneys fees and costs,relying as we noted before on the pslra incorporation of rule.for convenience,we refer below to rule directly,as there is no indication that the pslra modified the rule in any relevant respect.hartmarx sought recovery for costs related to four different pleadings its september motion for judgment on the pleadings,which had been torpedoed by lincoln on the question whether the initial announcement contemplated a tender offer its september motion for summary judgment,which it said was necessitated by lincoln alleged mistruths about the status of its financing as of august its september motion to dismiss lincoln counterclaims,which it claimed was also necessitated by lincoln alleged misrepresentations about financing and its opposition to lincoln october motion to dismiss for mootness after lincoln public withdrawal of the tender offer.after several hearings and supplemental briefings,the district court imposed sanctions under the pslra and rule,awarding hartmarx fees and costs totaling,imposed jointly and severally on lincoln and its attorneys.this appeal followed.
our review of a district court grant of rule sanctions is for abuse of discretion.see cooter gell hartmarx,d finance inv.bermuda geberit ag,cir.we therefore will apply that standard of review to the pslra sanctions imposed here.whether examined under the pslra or rule directly,a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.cooter gell,at.in exercising its discretion,a district court must also bear in mind that such sanctions are to be imposed sparingly,as they can have significant impact beyond the merits of the individual case and can affect the reputation and creativity of counsel.pacific dunlop holdings,barosh,cir.
lincoln principal contention in this appeal is that the sanctions order rested on a fundamentally incorrect view of the way the tender offer process is designed to operate.much of the confusion on all sides here stems from the sec relatively recent adoption of a broad package of amendments to the rules governing tender and exchange offers,mergers,and other business combinations under the securities act of and the securities exchange act of.the new rules were promulgated by the commission in a release entitled final rule regulation of takeovers and security holder communications.see exchange act release october,m a release.the amendments fundamentally overhauled the regulatory framework governing business combinations.they were intended to achieve a number of broad goals,including harmonizing the regulations governing tender offers with the rules pertaining to other kinds of business combinations increasing the flow of information to shareholders and other market players and minimizing regulatory tension particularly with sec rule and other parts of the securities laws.importantly,the new rules became effective on january,well before the acquisition attempt beginning in august that spawned this case.
two of the changes made by the m a release are especially important for our purposes.first,the new rules permit free communication with security holders beginning with the first public announcement of the transaction so long as the materials that relate to a tender offer are published with the commission upon first use.under the new rules,a public announcement is any oral or written communication by the bidder,or any person authorized to act on the bidder behalf,that is reasonably designed to,or has the effect of,informing the public or security holders in general about the tender offer.explanatory note.commencement is not triggered until a bidder has first published,sent or given the means to tender to security holders.id.at a.by allowing oral and written communications with security holders prior to extending a formal offer to purchase,the new rules substantially eliminate existing restrictions on communications.
second,the new rules abolish the requirement that a bidder must formally commence within five days of its announcement of the tender offer,and rely instead only on the general provisions of rule.that rule implements section e of the act,which makes it unlawful for a person 
to make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances,not misleading,or to engage in any fraudulent,deceptive,or manipulative acts or practices,in connection with any tender offer.
e.the relevant implementing regulations contained in rule prohibit announcement of an offer if the bidder 
a is making the announcement of a potential tender offer without the intention to commence the offer within a reasonable time and complete the offer 
b intends,directly or indirectly,for the announcement to manipulate the market price of the stock of the bidder or subject company or 
c does not have the reasonable belief that the person will have the means to purchase securities to complete the offer.
these new rules seek to balance the related policy goals of maximizing the flow of information prior to formal commencement of a tender offer,on the one hand,and the need to prevent fraudulent and misleading communications by market players with ulterior motives,on the other.the upshot is that a bidder is no longer required to commence a tender offer within a set period of time.nevertheless,the buyer is still forbidden to inject false or misleading information into the marketplace while the tender offer remains a possibility.
we turn first to the district court imposition of sanctions against appellants on the basis of its conclusion that lincoln lacked the requisite intent to complete a tender offer and a reasonable belief that it had the financial means to do so.those were legitimate concerns,as a brief look at the first and third subsections of rule shows.in support of its decision,the court pointed to lincoln repeated statements throughout the pleadings that it had arranged the necessary financing to carry out a business combination with hartmarx.these statements,the court believed,amounted to misrepresentations of the true state of lincoln financing as of august.lincoln intransigence,the district court thought,justified an award of sanctions as compensation for expenses incurred in preparing both hartmarx september motion for summary judgment and its september motion to dismiss lincoln counterclaims.
perhaps following the lead of the district court,the parties have approached this part of the case as if it turns on the meaning of the word arranged how concrete did the arrangements have to be did the money have to be in the bank or were promises enough how unconditional did those promises have to be while this is interesting,we do not believe that the ultimate meaning of the word arranged should dictate the outcome here.the important fact for rule purposes is that this was a new rule.the debate between the parties involves a close question of law under this new regime.as such,as long as lincoln was taking a reasonable legal position on the meaning of the rule,it should not be sanctioned even if the district court concluded that hartmarx had the better reading.
in particular,the m a release readily acknowledged that rule reasonable belief requirement was a slippery one and would probably be a locus of future litigation.see m a release at.in an attempt to provide some guidance on what constitutes a reasonable belief,the
