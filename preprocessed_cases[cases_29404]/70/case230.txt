this appeal concerns an ongoing battle by,to receive payment from the republic of congo on an outstanding debt.at issue are the district court dissolution of garnishment writs that would have allowed to garnish royalties owed to the congo a turnover order that requires the congo to receive monetary payment as opposed to in kind payment of the royalties and requires its debtors to pay the royalties into the court registry and a contempt order against the congo for failing to comply with the turnover order.
factual and procedural background 
in,equator bank limited,loaned the congo funds for building a highway the following year,the congo defaulted on the loan.more than ten years later,connecticut bank of commerce cbc,an assignee of equator bank,obtained a judgment against the congo in england.the congo did not make the payments required by the judgment and,as a consequence,cbc proceeded to enforce the judgment in the united states.in,a new york state court entered a money judgment against the congo in the amount of plus interest.subsequently,the new york court entered an order permitting attachment and execution against the assets of the congo in satisfaction of the judgment.
in,cbc registered the new york judgment in a texas state court and simultaneously filed a garnishment action.cbc alleged that cms nomeco congo,the nuevo congo company,and nuevo congo the cms companies,among others,owed royalties and taxes to the congo and sought to garnish those obligations to satisfy the judgment.the cms companies own working interests in a convention the convention that governs oil production in congolese waters.under the convention,the interest owners pay the congo royalties,which accrue when oil is taken from congolese territory.the congo chooses the method of payment for these royalties,either cash or in kind oil.since,the congo has opted to receive percent of its payments in kind.the state court,ex parte,issued writs of garnishment.
the congo and the cms companies removed the action to the united states district court for the western district of texas.in an order dated march,the district court held that the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,prohibited garnishment of the in kind royalties and tax obligations.this court vacated that decision,recognizing that the property at issue could fall within an exception to fsia if the property was used by the congo in conjunction with commercial activity in the united states.bank of commerce republic of congo,cir.the case was remanded for further factual development with regard to whether the property was used for commercial activity.
on remand,the district court found that the congo did not use its royalties and tax obligations for commercial activity.in doing so,the court dissolved the writs of garnishment against the cms companies.on appeal,this court vacated the district court decision,holding that the obligations at issue had been used for a commercial activity because the congo used some of the obligations to settle a lawsuit with the national union fire insurance company nufi.republic of congo,amended on rehearing,cir hereinafter ii.it also found that the situs of the obligations was the united states.id.at.this court again remanded,this time instructing the district court to determine which obligations had been used to pay the nufi debt.only those obligations would fall within the commercial activity exception.id.
following the remand,the district court denied a motion to reinstate the original writs of and,instead,issued new writs.shortly thereafter,however,the district court dissolved the new writs.in doing so,the court found that the nonmonetary obligations owed by the cms companies were not proper subjects of garnishment under texas law.in the same decision,the district court held that texas law allowed a turnover order,as an alternative method of attachment.the court issued a turnover order on february,that purports to take possession and control of all future royalty obligations owed to the congo,order the congo to turn over such royalty payments into the registry of the court,and order the congo to execute in three originals within three days the attached letter of instruction from the congo to the parties who pay royalties under the convention to the congo revoking prior instructions regarding payment of royalty and instructing that the royalty be paid in cash into the registry of the court.the royalties were to be applied in favor of until the judgment was satisfied.
in response to the turnover order,the congolese ministry of foreign affairs and francophony sent a letter to the district court stating that the congo would not follow the order because it violated the country sovereignty.the district court then issued an order directing the clerk of court to execute a letter of instruction,directing the cms companies to pay royalty obligations to the court registry.on july,the district court found the congo in contempt for failing to comply with the turnover order.neither the congo nor the cms companies has complied with the orders and the congo remains in contempt.
the parties timely appealed the order dissolving the writs of garnishment,the turnover order,and the contempt order.we consolidated the three appeals for oral argument and likewise do so now for disposition.
ii.standard of review 
for the contempt issue,the standard of review is abuse of discretion.united states city of jackson,cir.the underlying findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,and the underlying conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.id.for all of the remaining issues,the standard of review is de novo because the issues raise questions of law.randel dep t of the navy,cir.given that this is a diversity case,this court must apply the law of texas.see erie tompkins.if the law is unclear,this court must predict how the texas supreme court would rule.see herrmann holdings lucent techs,cir.when necessary,the standard of review is discussed in greater detail below.
iii.discussion 
garnishment action 
the first issue of this consolidated appeal is whether the district court erred by dissolving the writs of garnishment on the ground that texas law does not allow the garnishment of nonmonetary obligations.
garnishment actions in texas are purely statutory and courts have no power to extend the benefits of garnishment beyond the relief available under statute.beggs fite,see also.jur d creditors rights and remedies.the texas garnishment statute,however,does not address the question posed here.see.civ.prac.ann.ch.vernon.it makes no mention of nonmonetary debts.likewise,no texas case has specifically considered whether a nonmonetary obligation can be subject to garnishment.
texas does not allow garnishment of nonmonetary obligations 
our analysis of this issue is guided by the fact that garnishment has been long considered a harsh remed y by texas courts.varner koons,paso,orig.proceeding beggs,at describing garnishees as strangers to an action who are subjected to inconvenience and hazard.indeed,texas case law requires us to strictly construe the texas garnishment statute.see varner,at.given this task of strict construction,we find that expanding the garnishment statute to cover nonmonetary obligations goes too far.this holding conforms with the principle that courts do not have the equitable power to expand the purely statutory garnishment remedy.beggs,at.
our conclusion is informed by texas rule of civil procedure,which provides that in the event it is determined that the garnishee is indebted to the defendant in any amount,or was so indebted when the writ of garnishment was served,the court shall render judgment for the plaintiff against the garnishee for the amount so admitted or found to be due to the defendant from the garnishee.civ.emphasis added.this rule does not contemplate indebtedness as encompassing obligations other than money.see grocer pac,holding that an unliquidated claim for breach of contract can not be garnished willis heath,holding that a negotiable promissory instrument can not be garnished.indeed,texas courts define the term debt as a specified sum of money owing to one person from another.see seay hall,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in palmer coble wall trust.given that the cms companies have a nonmonetary obligation to pay in kind oil to the congo,it can not be garnished under texas law.
has failed to point this court to any authority that proves texas allows the garnishment of nonmonetary debts.instead,it mistakenly relies on authority related to effects.the texas garnishment statute contemplates garnishment of debts,money owed to a defendant,and effects,tangible property owned by the defendant in possession of the garnishee.see.civ.prac.ann.a after service of a writ of garnishment,the garnishee may not deliver any effects or pay any debt to the defendant.the only way the effects provision could be applicable here is if a physical object in the possession of the cms companies were the subject of this garnishment.that is simply not the case.indeed,this court already determined in ii that the royalty obligation at issue does not have physical characteristics.at t his property is intangible in nature.therefore,the issue before us concerns a debt,and the effects authority relied upon by is inapposite 
to conclude,this case turns on the fact that the obligation at issue is nonmonetary.the cms companies,operating under the convention,do not owe money to the congo they owe oil.does not ask this court to allow it to garnish that oil,assuming it could do so under the fsia,and instead seeks to be the beneficiary of the nonmonetary obligation.as explained above,texas does not allow garnishment of this type of debt.therefore,the district court did not err in dissolving the writs of garnishment.
other arguments fail 
also argues that the district court holding contravenes the law of the case.u nlike res judicata,the law of the case doctrine applies only to issues that were actually decided,rather than all questions in the case that might have been decided,but were not.ins.servs.prudential ins.of,cir.an issue is actually decided if the court explicitly decided it or necessarily decided it by implication.id.ii only addressed whether the obligations at issue were immune from garnishment under fsia.there is nothing in ii that interprets state garnishment law.therefore,the district court correctly questioned whether such an obligation could be garnishable in texas.
also argues that,as a plaintiff in a garnishment action,it can step into the shoes of the congo and elect to receive the royalty payments in cash.see rowley lake area bank,dist,pet.denied.this reasoning,however,ignores the chronology of a garnishment proceeding.the writs at issue must first capture a debt before a garnishor can step into the shoes of the creditor.if this were not the rule,garnishors could manipulate assets so that a writ could attach.here,the writs failed to capture anything,given that the obligation is nonmonetary.therefore,has no authority to request payment in cash.
b.the turnover order 
the second issue in this consolidated appeal is whether the district court erred in granting the turnover order that requires the congo to accept its royalty payments in cash and order its debtors to make those payments to the court registry.
the parties dispute the standard of review for this issue,with the congo arguing for de novo review and arguing for abuse of discretion.a combination of the two is required.while the entry of a turnover order is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,a district court necessarily abuses its discretion if its conclusion is based on an erroneous determination of the law.maiz virani,cir.this court reviews questions of law de novo.randel,at.it should be noted,however,that a trial court issuance of a turnover order,even if predicated on an erroneous conclusion of law,will not be reversed for abuse of discretion if the judgment is sustainable for any reason.maiz,at.
in texas,a court may order a judgment debtor to turn over nonexempt property that is in the debtor possession or is subject to the debtor control.civ.prac.ann.vernon.such an order can be enforced by contempt proceedings or by other appropriate means in the event of refusal or disobedience.id.the statute is the procedural device by which judgment creditors may reach assets of a debtor that are otherwise difficult to attach or levy on by ordinary legal process.beaumont bank,buller.
the district court did not have in personam jurisdiction over the congo 
the dissolution of the writs of garnishment and creation of the turnover order require this court to find a new justification for jurisdiction in this case.in ii,this court found jurisdiction based on the fact that the obligations were held by the cms companies who were located in the united states,and texas specifically.ii,at.with the turnover order,the district court bypasses the cms companies and directly orders the congo to act.to find in personam jurisdiction,this court must look to the fsia,which provides the sole basis for obtaining in personam jurisdiction over a foreign state.hashemite kingdom of jordan layale,in re aircraft serial,cir.in ii,this court looked at the fsia rules for property under a this court now must look at rules for in personam jurisdiction under a.as explained below,the fsia does not allow in personam jurisdiction over the congo 
section a has two relevant provisions to the present case.see a.in a,personal jurisdiction over a foreign state exists if the state has waived its immunity either explicitly or by implication.id.at a.in a,personal jurisdiction over a foreign state exists in certain commercial activity situations.id.at a.beginning with a,the commercial activity exception is foreclosed by reasoning used in ii.the ii court held that the situs under both and only possible because the cms companies,holding property of the congo,were located in the united states.under an analysis of the turnover order,however,the cms companies and the property they hold is not considered.the district court,by dissolving the writs and replacing them with a turnover order,lost the original foothold for jurisdiction.the commercial activity exception does not apply to the congo.
turning to a,the loan agreement does not explicitly waive immunity to suit in texas.loan agreement.the issue is therefore whether the congo has implicitly waived immunity to suit in texas.this court has identified three circumstances in which a waiver is ordinarily implied a foreign state agrees to arbitration in another country the foreign state agrees that a contract is governed by the laws of a particular country the state files a responsive pleading without raising the immunity defense.rodriguez transnave,cir internal citation omitted.none of these circumstances is present in this case.first,there is no arbitration agreement.second,the loan agreement states that it is to be governed by english law,not united states law.third,the pleadings with regard to the turnover order have consistently raised an immunity defense.if this court wanted to go outside of the three ordinary circumstances,it must still narrowly construe the implicit waiver clause of a.rodriguez,at c ourts rarely find that a nation has waived its sovereign immunity without strong evidence that this is what the foreign state intended.
in the case at hand,there is no evidence,and certainly no strong evidence,that the congo implicitly waived immunity to suit in texas.has failed to argue,much less show,how in personam jurisdiction is appropriate in texas.because the district court erroneously held that the congo waived its immunity,it abused its discretion.therefore,the turnover order is vacated 
the fugitive disentitlement doctrine does not require dismissal of this appeal 
by motion dated may,argued that the congo noncompliance with the turnover order should result in the dismissal of this appeal pursuant to the fugitive disentitlement doctrine.we carried the motion with the merits of the appeal and consider it now.as explained below,we will not extend the fugitive disentitlement doctrine as contemplated by.
this court has held that a s a general matter,willful flouting of the judicial system on the part of one seeking appellate redress should not go wholly unrecognized.united
