background 
this appeal is the latest chapter in a dispute between the parties.
procedural history 
neonatology is the treatment of newborns.at danbury hospital,two neonatology practice cnc and the hospital subsidiary,coexisted since when plaintiffs cnc physicians split off from dops to form their own practice group.the two groups compete for patients,and as such their relationship has been less than harmonious.
in,in response to defendants attempts to exclude cnc physicians from treating newborns at the hospital,cnc physicians sued for violation of federal and state antitrust laws.after a jury found for plaintiffs,the parties settled and entered into the consent decree at issue in this action.
the decree is designed to preclude defendants from engaging in further behavior.paragraph orders them to 
take no action,directly or indirectly,to limit,preclude or obstruct the plaintiffs,and each of them,from practicing neonatology at danbury hospital within the scope of their clinical privileges,in the same manner and to the same extent as any other neonatologist with medical staff privileges at the hospital.
paragraph is more specific.it requires that the hospital ensure that its neonatal nurse practitioners do not favor dops patients over those of cnc.
paragraph permits the hospital to adopt neutral policies that affect the manner in which the plaintiffs practice neonatology at the hospital,so long as such policies a apply equally to all neonatologists with medical staff privileges at the hospital,and b have been duly adopted and approved within the ordinary course of business.
later in,a hospital committee of neonatologists including plaintiff,joseph tuggle,pediatricians,and obstetricians created guidelines for neonatologist referrals.the purpose was to identify exactly which neonatology group would be responsible for the care of a given newborn.this decision was to be made by the patient before the delivery of the baby,and the guidelines emphasized patient choice.to this end,a form was given to obstetricians to record parents timely choice of neonatologist.
on march,the district court found dops and the hospital in contempt of the decree for the first time.specifically,the court held that lester silberman,then chairman of the hospital department of obstetrics and gynecology now retired,had encouraged obstetricians in two private practice for women pfw and candlewood associates candlewood to recommend that their patients select dops rather than cnc neonatologists.according to the court,this attempt to influence patients reduced referrals to cnc neonatologists and was directly attributable to the hospital misconduct.
as a result,the district court enjoined defendants from further violation of the decree,ordering them no longer,directly or indirectly,by word or conduct of their officers,employees,or agents,to affect or influence the designation of neonatologists at danbury hospital.
on march,dops and the hospital moved to stay the injunction and to clarify its scope.in particular,defendants expressed concern that the hospital current neonatologist designation policy was inconsistent with the injunction.in denying the stay,the district court found the injunction to be entirely consistent with the hospital neonatology referral guidelines and to simply reiterate the decree mandate that defendants not interfere with cnc physicians practice of neonatology at danbury hospital.
in keeping with the district court rulings,the hospital took steps to implement its policy more effectively.matthew miller,the hospital vice president of medical affairs,attempted to clarify the policy as well as the court instructions in a memorandum stating that a pregnant woman has complete authority to make these physician choices,and provided an updated designation form requiring the signature of the mother as well as of the obstetrician.
ii.the district court findings 
in,cnc physicians moved to hold dops and danbury hospital in contempt for a second time.they alleged that the hospital designation system is designed to,and does in fact,favor dops neonatologists the hospital entering into a joint venture with candlewood and pfw,the largest local obstetric groups,was a quid pro quo for the groups favoring of dops neonatologists and the hospital and dops encouraged the designation of dops neonatologists to the exclusion of cnc physicians.
the district court rejected the first two objections,finding that the referral system was not per se biased and that no quid pro quo existed.regarding the third allegation,the court concluded that after certain,richard ruben and james to steer obstetricians toward dops to the exclusion of cnc neonatologists,but that defendants were not directly responsible for the ir conduct.nevertheless,according to the court,the hospital could have avoided this improper influence by providing for the designation to be obtained by other than obstetricians,and its failure to cancel or neutralize the enlistment of obstetricians constituted contempt.specifically,the court faulted the hospital but not dops for putting obstetricians in charge of obtaining patients neonatologist designation despite its knowledge that the obstetricians recommendations continued to be tainted by the prior influence.
to cure the contempt,the court ordered the hospital to assign the responsibility of recording patients choice of neonatologist to.the court suggested that these choices be obtained from patients during pregnancy,by mail or direct communication by hospital personnel with the prospective parent s.the district court awarded cnc physicians in damages just of their alleged losses and cited other independent,factors as possibly contributing to the decrease in cnc referrals.it declined to award costs or to appoint a special master.
this appeal followed.
