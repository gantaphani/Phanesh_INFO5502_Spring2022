after previous orders and monetary sanctions failed to bring about parker compliance with the discovery process the trial court sanctioned parker by dismissing his complaint against all defendants and entered his default on the brought by two of the defendants.parker appeals from the ensuing judgment and challenges the validity of the underlying discovery orders which led to it.
we affirm the judgment in part and reverse it in part.we reverse one of the monetary sanction orders.we hold the trial court erred in imposing terminating sanctions in favor of parties who did not propound discovery themselves or show how they were prejudiced by parker failure to comply with the discovery requests propounded by others.

discussion 
i.an appellate brief incorporating by reference points and authorities filed in the trial court does not satisfy the requirement a brief support each point by argument and,if possible,by citation of authority.cal.rules of court,rule a b.
throughout his brief on appeal parker alludes to arguments he made in the trial court and purports to incorporate these arguments by reference in his appellate brief.it is,however,this practice does not comply with rule a b of the california rules of court,which requires an appellate brief support each point by argument and,if possible,by citation of authority.
while incorporation by reference might seem to make sense ecologically,by reducing the amount of paper used in appellate briefs,the actual result would be to increase the amount of paper used in an appeal.the rules require an original and four copies of the appellate brief the original brief stays with the record on appeal.each of the three justices on the panel deciding the case receive copies of the briefs which they can use at their desks,work on at home,or take with them when traveling for an engagement outside the court.the fourth copy remains in the clerk office for public inspection.only one copy of the trial court record is filed in the appellate court,however if all three justices had to share this single record in order to review,research and evaluate a party arguments the time it would take for the court to decide the appeal would considerably increase.this would work a hardship on the parties to that appeal and to the parties in other appeals awaiting their turn for consideration and decision.alternatively,four copies of the trial court record would have to be filed with the court of appeal.because these records often consist of thousands of pages it is easy to see how the amount of paper used in the appeal would increase significantly.
therefore,in deciding the issues in this appeal we have not considered parker incorporated arguments 
v.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a terminating sanction by dismissing parker complaint against wkus.
events leading up to the terminating sanction.failure to respond to interrogatories.
in june wkus served parker with a set of form interrogatories and a set of special interrogatories.parker did not answer these interrogatories within the time provided by statute.after several telephone calls and from counsel for wkus,parker promised to serve his responses by august.when no responses arrived by august wkus filed a motion to compel.this motion was taken off calendar when parker served his responses later in august.parker did not verify his responses and objected to some interrogatories although all objections were waived because the responses were late in addition,wkus found many of parker responses inadequate.
parker ignored wkus efforts to meet and confer concerning his responses.therefore,in october wkus filed a motion to compel further answers to the form and special interrogatories.in his opposition to the motion parker argued his responses were adequate and proper but did not deny his failure to meet and confer with wkus regarding those responses.
in november the trial court ordered parker to provide supplemental responses,properly verified,within ten days of its order.it sanctioned parker in the sum of.at the time of the motion for terminating sanctions in december parker still had not served his supplemental responses.
failure to attend and participate in depositions.
wkus noticed parker deposition for august.parker appeared minutes late,refused to be sworn or testify and left stating this deposition is over.after parker refused to reconsider his position,and with trial three months away and the deadline for filing a motion for summary judgment one month away,wkus filed a motion to compel parker deposition.the trial court granted this motion and ordered parker to appear for his deposition on october.the court denied wkus request for monetary sanctions.
parker arrived for his october deposition with his one or two year old granddaughter whom he brought with him into the deposition room.the child was sick and by parker own admission had been crying all day and was screaming and hollering throughout the deposition.after being deposed for approximately an hour parker informed defense counsel he was leaving to take his granddaughter to a doctor and would not return to los angeles for no deposition unless you pay for it.defense counsel stated to parker i f you need to take your granddaughter to the doctor,you should take her to the doctor but counsel notified parker he would seek an order from the trial court directing him to return to resume his deposition.
on october,the trial court issued an ex parte order directing parker to appear for his deposition on november unaccompanied by his granddaughter or any other person other than an attorney and awarded sanctions against parker in the sum of.
parker failed to appear for his deposition on november.he gave no prior warning he intended to disobey the trial court order and did not respond to telephone calls from defense counsel regarding his whereabouts.
by this time the date for filing a summary judgment motion had passed,trial was less than days away,the status conference was days away and wkus had not received parker supplemental responses to interrogatories nor had it been able to complete his deposition.the trial court granted defendants ex parte motion to continue the pretrial and trial dates.
on november all four defendants moved for terminating,evidence and monetary sanctions against parker.the motion was based on parker conduct described above as well as other less serious violations of the discovery rules.the trial court granted the motion finding the failure of plaintiff to provide written responses to discovery and the failure of plaintiff to appear for his deposition,pursuant to the october,order,to be willful and without justification.as a sanction the court struck parker complaint as to all four defendants and his answer to the wkus and entered his default on the.
prior to the default on the parker made,and the trial court denied,a motion to vacate the default and reinstate his complaint and his answer to the.
at the hearing on the the trial court awarded damages to wkus in the sum of plus prejudgment interest.the court also added to the judgment the sanction for failing to file supplemental responses to interrogatories.
following entry of judgment parker moved to set aside the judgment and to reconsider the judgment and orders of the court.this motion was denied.
b.the trial court did not err when it imposed a sanction on parker for his unsuccessful opposition to the motion to compel further responses to interrogatories.
parker contends the trial court erred when it sanctioned him in connection with its order requiring him to provide further answers to interrogatories because there had been no previous order compelling him to respond,the court did not make a finding his opposition lacked substantial justification and the amount of the sanction was unreasonable and excessive.we reject parker contentions.
monetary sanctions are allowed against a party refusing to make discovery even if the party has not refused to obey a previous order.the trial court is not required to make a specific finding the party opposition to a motion to compel further responses was without substantial justification.
section,subdivision d states the trial court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party,person,or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories,unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.italics added.nothing in the statute suggests a party is entitled to one free refusal to serve further responses before a monetary sanction can be imposed.on the contrary,the plain language of the statute requires the trial court to impose a monetary sanction even for the first offense.the only exception to this requirement is for a circumstance constituting a substantial justification for failing to respond.the trial court must make a finding this exception exists.the court need not make an explicit finding the exception does not exist as this is implied in the order awarding sanctions.
furthermore,wkus established without contradiction parker refused to meet and confer regarding further responses to the interrogatories.this is a separate offense entitling the moving party to monetary sanctions n otwithstanding the outcome of the particular discovery motion.
as to the amount of sanctions,section,subdivision a authorizes the trial court to impose an amount representing the reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,incurred by anyone as a result of a party misuse of the discovery process.in support of the request for sanctions in this case defense counsel submitted a declaration stating they had expended an hour reviewing parker responses to interrogatories,four hours attempting to meet and confer with parker and drafting a formal meet and confer letter,and hours preparing and reviewing the motion to compel further responses.counsel estimated they would spend an additional three hours reviewing and preparing a reply to parker opposition to the motion and attending the hearing on the motion.counsel billed their client a blended rate of per hour.accordingly,counsel asked for sanctions in the sum of.the trial court cut that request by.we can not say the court abused its discretion in making this award 
c.the trial court did not err when it ordered parker to appear for his deposition on november but did err in its ex parte imposition of monetary sanctions for his disruption and refusal to proceed with the october deposition.
parker contends the trial court erred in granting wkus ex parte motion ordering him to attend the october deposition in los angeles miles from his place of residence and in sanctioning him for disrupting and refusing to proceed with his deposition.
a party desiring to take the deposition of a natural person who is a party at a place more distant than otherwise permitted under section generally miles from the deponent residence should first obtain a court order under section.parker,however,waived any objection to the location of the deposition by failing to serve a written objection on wkus at least three calendar days prior to the date of the deposition furthermore,parker failed to submit a declaration or any other evidence his residence is miles from los angeles.we note parker used an address in torrance,a los angeles suburb,on his complaint and answer to the.the notice of deposition was sent to this torrance address and parker obviously received it because he presented himself on the date and at the place noticed.
parker further contends the ex parte order of october directing him to appear for his deposition on november and imposing a monetary sanction for not submitting to his deposition on october was invalid because it was issued without notice and an opportunity to be heard.
the discovery law contemplates a need may arise for an ex parte motion to compel a witness to appear and answer questions at a deposition.section,subdivision c provides notice of a motion to compel answers at a deposition shall be given to all parties and to the deponent either orally at the examination,or by subsequent service in writing.
ex parte applications to the superior court are authorized by the california rules of court,rules through.upon reviewing the record we conclude wkus complied with the requirements for an ex parte application to compel parker attendance at a deposition.
with respect to notice,rule of the court rules provides in relevant part a party seeking an ex parte order must notify all parties no later than the court day before the ex parte appearance the record shows that as parker walked out on his monday october deposition counsel for wkus told him we are going to notice and are noticing an ex parte appearance on wednesday before judge willett to seek a protective order to have you ordered to come back.counsel further informed parker he would seek the order at parker replied,i do care what you do i not going to be participating.i going to be back in atlanta.thus,the record shows parker received two court days advance notice of wkus ex parte appearance,longer than the rules require 
discovery sanctions,however,can not be awarded ex parte.section states in relevant part t he court,after notice to any affected party,person,or attorney,and after opportunity for hearing,may impose monetary sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process.in alliance bank murray we held when a discovery statute requires a notice and opportunity for hearing before the imposition of sanctions the statute requires a written notice served in accordance with the time frames set out in section a sanction order issued ex parte is void therefore,the sanction against parker for disrupting and refusing to proceed with his deposition on october must be reversed 
a detailed analysis of parker lesser contentions with respect to the trial court underlying discovery orders is not necessary.we have examined his points and find them to be without merit 
d.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a terminating sanction in favor of wkus by dismissing parker complaint.
the power to impose discovery sanctions is a broad discretion subject to reversal only for arbitrary,capricious or whimsical action.a decision to impose the ultimate judgment in the opposing party not be made lightly.but where a violation is willful,preceded by a history of abuse,and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules,the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.here,the record provides ample support for the trial court actions.
the undisputed facts show parker refused to testify at his august deposition disrupted and unil
