in,we affirmed a grant of partial summary judgment for lexmark international lexmark in a suit brought by lexmark partners,bdt products and gmbh company kg hereinafter collectively bdt,arising from the contention that lexmark had misappropriated trade secrets in developing a printer tray that substantially resembled a tray developed by bdt.among the firms appearing for bdt were higgs,fletcher mack higgs and meisenheimer herron steele meisenheimer.following our ruling,the district court granted lexmark motion for attorney fees and imposed sanctions to the extent of those fees more than five million dollars on bdt,higgs,and meisenheimer under kentucky revised statute,and its inherent powers.meisenheimer now appeals the imposition of these sanctions,arguing that courts may not impose sanctions under on law firms as opposed to individual attorneys,and that,regardless,bdt suit was not necessarily meritless and lexmark has not demonstrated that meisenheimer as opposed to bdt or higgs acted in bad faith or with improper purpose we agree that courts may not impose sanctions on law firms under the critical question,then,is whether the court abused its discretion in imposing sanctions under its inherent powers.we conclude that,as bdt tray was commercialized and sold before bdt even transmitted some of its information to lexmark,bdt and its attorneys pursued a suit based at its heart on misappropriation of trade secrets that were,in fact,not secret at all.in determining that meisenheimer acted in bad faith or with improper purpose in pursuing this meritless lawsuit,however,the district court relied in part upon a misstatement of sixth circuit law and,without sufficient proof,ascribed the improper purpose sought by bdt and higgs to meisenheimer as well.accordingly,we vacate the district court order insofar as it imposes sanctions on meisenheimer and remand to the district court for entry of an order denying lexmark motion for sanctions as to meisenheimer and for any other necessary actions consistent with this opinion.
beginning in,lexmark and bdt,which both develop paper handling technology for printers,worked together on various projects.as part of this relationship,between and the two companies entered into seven confidentiality agreements,including four agreements confidential disclosure agreements under which only lexmark was to disclose confidential information to bdt and three agreements confidential exchange agreements under which lexmark and bdt disclosed confidential information to each other.each of these agreements expressly provided that lexmark was free to use and disclose through sales of its products any information bdt disclosed to lexmark.
language of the confidentiality agreements 
each of the four confidential disclosure agreements,which were signed by bdt respectively in february of,august of,june of,and march of,included the following paragraph 
in connection with this agreement,lexmark does not wish to receive any information which may be considered confidential or proprietary by contractor.accordingly,except with respect to the rights of contractor under valid patents and copyrights,no obligation of any kind is assumed by or is to be implied against lexmark by virtue of lexmark discussions with contractor or with respect to any information received in whatever form from contractor and lexmark will be free to reproduce,use and disclose such information to others without limitation.moreover,discussions correspondence,or other activities under this agreement shall not in any respect,impair the right of lexmark to make,procure,or market products or services now or in the future which may be competitive with those offered by contractor.
appellee app x vi.the first of the confidential exchange agreements,which was signed by bdt in may of,stated as part of paragraph 
except with respect to rights under valid patents,the receiving party shall be free to use any such confidential information provided by the disclosing party,any reports and written documentation prepared by the receiving party,and any ideas,concepts techniques contained in any such confidential information for any purpose including the use of such information in the development,manufacture,marketing and maintenance of its products and services,subject only to the obligation not to disclose,publish,or disseminate such confidential information during such foregoing specific period of confidentiality.
appellee app x vi.each of the other two confidential exchange agreements,which were signed by bdt in march of and march of respectively,contained the same language in paragraph 
except with respect to rights under valid patents and copyrights,recipient shall be free to use any such confidential information provided by discloser subject only to the obligation not to disclose,publish or disseminate such confidential information during the foregoing specified period of confidentiality.
appellee app x vi.section c of the and confidential exchange agreements and section c of the confidential exchange agreement stated that any obligations under the agreements to maintain confidentiality would not apply to information that was or that became publically available without breach.similarly,section f of the and confidential exchange agreements and section f of the confidential exchange agreement provided an exemption from disclosure obligation for information that is inherently disclosed in the use,lease,sale or other distribution of,or publicly available supporting documentation for,any present or future product or service by or for recipient appellee app x vi.
lexmark sale of technology resembling bdt lf printer tray 
in the confines of a closed and confidential prototype room at the hannover fair,an annual printer industry trade show in germany,bdt demonstrated to lexmark both a diverter output device and an advanced input tray,known for the purposes of this suit as the lf.following the fair,bdt at lexmark request provided prototypes of the lf,information on the timing sequences and algorithms for the printer tray,and the costs of a license for the technology and of the product itself if manufactured by bdt.between and,lexmark repeatedly asked for,and bdt repeatedly provided,advice and information on the workings of the lf.ultimately,however,lexmark informed bdt that it was not interested in licensing the lf.
during this period,bdt also entered into discussions with other clients,including hewlett packard guadalajara hewlett packard and tektronix,regarding technology.as part of those discussions,bdt executed confidential disclosure agreements with both clients,under which bdt promised to safeguard the confidential information of its clients,but its clients were not required to safeguard confidential information provided by bdt.late in,bdt began to develop what ultimately became the auxiliary tray for hewlett packard printer,which hewlett packard released to the public in.as the district court noted in granting lexmark motion for partial summary judgment,the tray was the first commercial tray to embody every component of the bdt system that is at issue in this case.bdt,lexmark int l,d.
given lexmark decision not to license the lf technology,bdt representatives were taken aback at the end of,when lexmark demonstrated its new optra s printer that,to bdt eyes,utilized that technology.
bdt preparation for filing a lawsuit 
having concluded that lexmark had somehow acted inappropriately by developing the optra s,bdt contacted its intellectual property attorney,bernard kleinke,who was then with the higgs firm.bdt did not,however,immediately file suit,because it did not know what it could file about.instead,bdt asked kleinke to research the issue and determine whether he thought that lexmark took bdt look and feel or trade.at the end of,kleinke suggested to bdt that there might be a good case against lexmark,but that bdt should wait before filing suit to see whether lexmark would also release the diverter lexmark had seen at the hannover fair,on which bdt had a patent.lexmark never released the diverter,and early in higgs agreed to take the lf suit on a contingency fee basis.
in explaining why bdt chose to file its lawsuit,freidhelm steinhilber,the head of the management board of gmbh company kg,stated that the main reason was that we do like if somebody takes information from us and uses it freely and to protect our ip,number one district court mem.order,june,dcm at.glenn klein,the president of bdt products,stated that the biggest reason was that we had offered them for a license.we offered them a license three times,and three times they turned us down on the license.dcm at.we wanted to get a license from those guys,yeah,klein concluded.dcm at.bdt was also worried that bdt existing customers would believe that the technology they had purchased from bdt actually belonged to another company.
in preparation for filing a suit,bdt provided higgs with correspondence and communications between bdt and lexmark from.from these materials,and from correspondence between klein and kleinke in,higgs created the bdt lexmark chronology of facts.as a result of a misstatement or falsehood in a december letter from klein to kleinke,the chronology of facts contained the was,quite simply,bdt and lexmark had executed a confidential disclosure agreement in explicitly covering the lf technology.
also as part of its investigation,higgs researched whether commercial sale of the tray released in revealed bdt trade secrets.higgs,strongly influenced by bdt representatives,ultimately concluded that the trade secrets encompassed much more than the physical embodiment of the tray.in the minds of higgs attorneys,the district court observed,this included bdt regarding how each part functioned and worked together,bdt reliability and testing data,and bdt algorithms,none of which could be revealed through a physical examination of the tray.dcm at.
the district court concluded that higgs intended purpose as it prepared to file a complaint was quite clear higgs intended to force a settlement on behalf of its client,bdt.dcm at.a november higgs memo stated that lexmark would settle the case quickly,as otherwise lexmark would face in expenses.a may higgs memo stated that it was the higgs litigation team collective judgment that the target audience for this complaint is less the court than the corporate managers and lexmark lawyers,who we hope will see from the complaint the wisdom of an early,negotiated settlement.dcm at.
the verified complaint august,
on august,higgs on behalf of bdt filed the initial verified complaint in california.the complaint,which was sworn by klein,contained the false claim that in bdt and lexmark had executed a confidential disclosure agreement covering the lf.the district court noted that t he verified complaint contains a remarkable amount of detail regarding a document which bdt now admits never existed.dcm at.higgs attorney john morris,the draftsman of the verified complaint,later stated that he wished to convey a theme concerning the evolving relationship of trust and confidence and was not trying to convey the idea that the particular the particular trade secrets that were the essence of this lawsuit were governed by and controlled by the particular confidential disclosure agreement mentioned.dcm at.
the association of the meisenheimer firm and the amending of the complaint 
following the departure in of a higgs litigator for other employment,bdt and higgs invited matthew herron of meisenheimer to join the litigation team.before agreeing to do so,herron conducted an extensive review of the litigation materials,met with klein,and attended klein deposition.the court received notice of the association of herron as counsel for bdt on august,as of november,kleinke was no longer assigned to the case by higgs.upon joining the litigation,herron sought and received permission to file an amended complaint in which he removed references to any confidentiality agreements covering the lf technology and focused on five of the eight claims stated in the verified complaint.the district court noted that herron would have preferred to focus only on the complaint third claim,misappropriation of trade secrets,but that the higgs firm insisted on inclusion of the other four claims.
developments in the suit lexmark letter and paul vickrey as a consultant 
on june,at lexmark insistence,lexmark counsel sent herron a letter in part identifying the existence of the confidentiality agreements that lexmark believed permitted lexmark to use bdt confidential information.the letter also pointed out that the final alleged trade secrets were evident from sale of devices that plainly exhibit the alleged trade secrets.dcm at.it can only be concluded,the letter added,that you and your clients know that the claims are unsupportable and lack probable cause and that plaintiffs are pursuing this litigation for nefarious purposes.dcm at.as the district court noted,meisenheimer,then charged with conducting the matter on behalf of bdt,continued with the prosecution of this matter,nonetheless.the rest,as they say,is history.dcm at.
late in,as the parties engaged in extensive discovery,meisenheimer sought assistance from kleinke,who had in the meantime left higgs and joined the law firm of foley lardner in san diego.foley lardner entered its appearance on behalf of bdt on november.according to meisenheimer,foley lardner work ultimately directed meisenheimer to paul vickrey,a chicago attorney with extensive experience in trade secret matters,and meisenheimer received bdt permission to hire vickrey as a consultant.vickrey,having reviewed lexmark motion for summary judgment,informed herron that he believed that bdt had a strong case,and that his firm would be willing to join the litigation on a contingent fee basis if bdt survived summary judgment.vickrey deposition,appellant app x at.
procedural history 
higgs first filed a verified complaint in the california state court on august.following removal to federal court and a protracted venue fight that made its way to the ninth circuit,venue was transferred to the eastern district of kentucky on february.following his association with the suit,herron sought and received permission to amend the complaint,which he did,filing the amended complaint on august.higgs,and not meisenheimer,was counsel of record at the time the amended complaint was filed.the amended complaint asserted five causes of action breach of an contract breach of an contract misappropriation of trade secrets pursuant to california civil code,et unfair competition pursuant to california business professional code,and breach of confidence.lexmark moved to dismiss counts,and,but the court denied the motion without prejudice.
after extensive discovery,lexmark filed motions for partial summary judgment and summary judgment.on march,the district court granted lexmark motion for partial summary judgment,determining that kentucky substantive law governed the matter,and dismissed bdt claims for breach of contract,unfair competition,and breach of confidence.dcm at.on july,the court dismissed bdt remaining claims for breach of contract and trade secret misappropriation under kutsa.the district court concluded that by bdt own admission there was never any agreement under which lexmark promised not to use the lf technology,and lexmark could not have misappropriated bdt information because the confidential disclosure agreements and confidential exchange agreements between bdt and lexark specifically permitted lexmark to use that information,bdt,d at and the information at issue in the suit was not a legally cognizable trade secret,as,prior to lexmark supposed misappropriation,bdt had disclosed its technology to both hewlett packard and tektronix under confidential disclosure agreements that did not protect bdt confidential information,id.at.in its decision,the district court did not discuss the importance of the commercial sale in of hewlett packard paper it did lay out the facts behind the hewlett packard release.the district court entered a judgment in favor of lexmark on september.
bdt immediately appealed the court grant of summary judgment,and in we affirmed the district court judgment in toto.see bdt,lexmark int l,app x,cir,the three judges on the panel did not agree completely as to the grounds on which their ruling should be based.the majority concluded that through the confidential disclosure agreements and confidential exchange agreements between lexmark and bdt,bdt had contracted away any rights it had against lexmark disclosure of bdt information,id.at through its disclosure of the lf to hewlett packard and tektronix subject only to confidential disclosure agreements,bdt had extinguished its proprietary interest,such that no trade secrets existed in the case,id.at and through commercial sales of the paper tray in,bdt trade secrets had similarly been freely disclosed,such that they no longer constituted trade secrets,more than two years before lexmark introduced the optra s,id.at.
in contrast,judge merritt based his concurrence on the single ground that by the time lexmark introduced its tray in,hewlett packard had been selling the same tray on the open commercial market for over two years.id.at merritt,concurring.judge merritt added 
had the trade secret not already been revealed to the public in the tray long before the lexmark tray came on the market,i would have some doubts about the proper outcome in this case,and i would be reluctant to dispose of the case on summary judgment 
the fact that here there were written contracts expressly giving lexmark confidentiality protection,but not bdt,certainly weakens bdt claims,as the court concludes.but a reasonable jury might still find that bdt claimed trade secrets were protected by the inherently confidential relationships between the designer,bdt,and its clients,lexmark,hewlett packard and tektronix.
officials from hewlett packard and tektronix gave depositions in which they testified that officials of those clients considered similar bdt design information confidential in the absence of a written agreement.
id.at merritt,concurring.to summarize two of the panel judges agreed with the district court two grounds for approving lexmark motion for summary judgment,while one disagreed,concluding that a reasonable jury might agree with bdt all three agreed that lexmark was entitled to summary judgment because the release of the had disclosed bdt confidential information.
following our ruling,the case returned to district court on lexmark motion for attorney fees.after receiving memoranda and proposed findings from the parties and holding a evidentiary hearing,the district court found that bdt,higgs,and meisenheimer had pursued a lawsuit that should never have been brought,and in which no attorney should have persisted.dcm at.the district court granted lexmark motion under kentucky revised statute,and its inherent sanctions against bdt,higgs,and meisenheimer in the amount of lexmark attorney fees.lexmark,the district court noted,
has set forth clear and convincing evidence that bdt counsel asserted and pursued frivolous claims on behalf of its client from day damage for breach of a contract which never existed and could never be implied as well as the alleged misappropriation of a putative trade secret at the heart of all of bdt claims which had been publically disclosed well in advance of any prefiling investigation by higgs,which had been disclosed to others pursuant to agreements which offered no protection to bdt lf technology,and when the only agreement between the parties to the suit never afforded protection to any of bdt technology.
dcm at.after considering what part bdt and its attorneys had respectively played in bringing,pursuing,and prolonging the suit,the court allocated of the responsibility to bdt,to higgs,and to meisenheimer.as to meisenheimer individual responsibility,the court stated 
unlike higgs,meisenheimer herron made efforts to streamline the suit by paying careful attention to the evidence available and by amending the complaint accordingly.see,at record at.indeed,herron would have dismissed all claims,with the exception of the kutsa claim,but for the insistence of higgs that the other claims which appeared in the amended complaint remain.record at.herron crafted an amended complaint which no longer averred that the disclosure of the lf technology was made specifically pursuant to the confidential disclosure agreements and removed any reference to any confidentiality agreements specific to the lf which did not exist.that said,herron looked specifically at testimony elicited from bdt representatives and documents during the suit,but he remained blind to the importance of the information that was always was sic in bdt and counsel possession prior to and during the course of this lawsuit.his actions may have been laudable in many respects but they were not enough to end this unfortunate lawsuit.
dcm at.this appeal followed the actual imposition of sanctions on august.
meisenheimer first argument is that the district court erred to the extent that it imposed sanctions under,as permits the imposition of sanctions against individual lawyers,but not against law firms.according to 
any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the united states or any territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.
whether this language prohibits the sanctioning of law firms is an issue of law that the court reviews de novo.claiborne wisdom,cir.while we have never directly ruled on this question,after the district court issued its order requiring meisenheimer to pay sanctions in this case,a sixth circuit panel stated in dicta that does not authorize the imposition of sanctions on a represented party,nor does it authorize the imposition of sanctions on a law firm.rentz dynasty apparel,cir imposing sanctions against attorneys in their individual capacities solely under.rather than under citing claiborne,at.
o ne panel of the sixth circuit is not bound by dicta in a previously published panel opinion.united states burroughs,cir.nonetheless,a lthough dictum is unnecessary to the decision,it may nevertheless be followed if sufficiently persuasive.pdv midwest,armada oil gas,cir.the rentz court,while offering no analysis itself,cited to claiborne,in which the seventh circuit collected cases and issued a explanation of why,under,judges may not appropriately sanction law firms.as the claiborne court observed 
our sister circuits have come to differing conclusions without focusing on the precise legal question at stake t hese decisions are inconclusive.we therefore consider for ourselves whether a law firm is subject to sanctions under.
the statute itself refers to a ny attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the united states.individual lawyers,not firms,are admitted to practice before both the state courts and the federal courts.citations omitted.the fact that refers to other person s admitted to conduct cases is of no help to the defendants.this language reflects the fact that in limited circumstances may appear in judicial proceedings,such as in patent proceedings or where law students receive special permission to conduct cases before they are admitted to the bar.citations omitted.it is too much of a stretch to say that a law firm could also be characterized as such a person.
our conclusion has the virtue of being consistent with the rationale the supreme court used in pavelic leflore marvel entertainment group,d,when it considered the question whether sanctions were possible against a law firm under an earlier version of.the rule was amended as of december,to ensure that law firms could be subject to sanctions under its authority.in pavelic leflore,however,the court had to construe language that permitted sanctions only against the person who signed the offending document.at,d.the district court,affirmed by the court of appeals,had found that this language permitted it to impose sanctions not only against the lawyer who signed the papers,but also against his law firm.the supreme court reversed,finding that in context the phrase the person who signed could only mean the individual signer,not his partnership,either in addition to him or in the alternative.the language of raises exactly the same problem as the earlier version of rule.even if pavelic leflore does not strictly dictate the outcome here,it points strongly in the direction we have taken.
claiborne,at.
we find the analysis and reasoning of the claiborne court persuasive.even if firms can admittedly be personified in a literary sense through briefs,there is no reason to consider a law firm a person under the statute.more importantly,law firms are not admitted to conduct cases in court.we therefore confirm what the rentz court stated in dicta,that does not authorize the imposition of sanctions on law firms.we thus conclude that the district court erred insofar as it imposed sanctions on meisenheimer under.
in addition to sanctioning meisenheimer under,the district court imposed sanctions to the extent of attorney fees under its inherent power to sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.see,chambers nasco,d.we review a court imposition of sanctions under its inherent powers for abuse of discretion.id.at.before considering whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing such sanctions,we take the opportunity to clarify our case law on when a district court may assess attorney fees under its inherent powers,and we affirm the validity of the test we laid out in big yank liberty mut.fire ins,cir.
generally,fee shifting is prohibited under the american rule,which is deeply rooted in our history and in congressional policy.see alyeskaya pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d.congress,however,while fully recognizing and accepting the general rule,has made specific and explicit provisions for the allowance of attorneys fees under selected statutes granting or protecting various federal rights.id.at.in addition to awarding fees under one of these statutory provisions,moreover,a court may assess attorney fees against a party under the court inherent powers when a party has acted in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly,or for oppressive reasons.chambers,at quoting alyeska pipeline serv,at.this bad faith exception to the american imposition of sanctions under a court inherent requires a finding of bad faith or of conduct tantamount to bad faith.youn track,cir quoting first bank of marietta hartford underwriters ins,cir roadway,piper,d.
in the sixth circuit,we apply a test to determine whether a district court may properly impose sanctions to the extent of attorney fees under this bad faith exception.in order to award attorney fees under this bad faith exception,a district court must find that the claims advanced were meritless,that counsel knew or should have known this,and that the motive for filing the suit was for an improper purpose such as harassment.big yank,at quoting smith detroit fed of teachers,local,cir.the big yank requirement that a court find that a party have an improper purpose in filing a suit resembles the supreme court general requirement that a court find bad faith or conduct tantamount to bad faith.put another way,satisfying the overarching bad faith requirement mandated by the supreme court before imposition of sanctions under a court inherent powers often automatically satisfies the improper purpose prong of the big yank test.see first bank of marietta,at this court has likewise used improper purpose and bad faith interchangeably.chambers,at t he exception resembles the third prong of rule certification requirement,which mandates that a signer of a paper filed with the court warrant that the paper is not interposed for any improper purpose,such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.
as this case demonstrates,there is some confusion regarding what behavior constitutes improper purpose,bad faith or conduct tantamount to bad faith.in particular,it is not entirely clear from our case law whether the simple fact that a party pursued a clearly frivolous and meritless lawsuit constitutes conduct that is tantamount to bad faith sufficient for the imposition of sanctions such a rule clearly risks collapsing the third big yank prong that the motive for filing was improper purpose into the first two prongs that the claims were meritless,and that counsel knew or should have known that the claims were meritless.see first bank of marietta,at gilman,concurring in part and dissenting in part nothing in big yank or its progeny,however,indicates that this third requirement is surplusage.
this exact concern was the subject of a debate in first bank of marietta,at.having found that the evidence in that case demonstrated that the claim was clearly meritless and that counsel knew or should have known so,the majority observed that the district court had expressly concluded that the sanctioned party acted in bad faith in bringing the action.id.implicit in this finding,the court explained,is that the sanctioned party improperly used the court system to try to force a result that it could not obtain under the applicable law,which is separate and district sic from the issue of whether the sanctioned party was attempting to prevail on the merits of its lawsuit and collect payment on a meritless claim.see also id.at our inference is in accord with this court ruling that i f,from the facts found,other facts may be inferred which will support the judgment,such inferences shall be deem sic to have been drawn by the district court.quoting zack comm r of internal revenue,cir the dissent,however,challenged the suggestion that it is possible to infer that a claim is filed for an improper purpose if the claim is invalid and is put forth by a litigant who knows that the claim is invalid.id.at gilman,concurring in part and dissenting in part.the majority discussion of this inference,moreover,was dicta the majority ultimately affirmed the district court finding of bad faith after concluding that the plaintiffs had made improper use of the courts.to demonstrate this improper use,the majority pointed both to the plaintiff pursuit of a meritless suit and to the plaintiff withholding of material evidence in support of its claim.see id.at.in other words,the first bank of marietta court did not find that the plaintiff knowing pursuit of a meritless claim by itself demonstrated bad faith or improper purpose within the meaning of the third big yank prong.
in order to clarify any remaining confusion,we hereby hold that the mere fact that an action is without merit does not amount to bad faith.miracle mile assocs.city of rochester,cir citing runyan mccrary,d.by this,we mean that in order for a court to find bad faith sufficient for imposing sanctions under its inherent powers,the court must find something more than that a party knowingly pursued a meritless claim or action at any stage of the proceedings in big yank,the court indicated that the something more could be a finding that the party had filed the suit for purposes of harassment or delay,or for other improper reasons.at quoting colombrito kelly,cir.in first bank of marietta,the something more was a party improper use of the courts,which was demonstrated by the fact that the plaintiff file d a meritless lawsuit and withheld material evidence in support of a claim.at emphasis in original citing mansmann tuman.in chambers,the supreme court suggested that a court could find that fraud has been practiced upon it,or that the very temple of justice has been defiled by actions such as a party delaying or disrupting the litigation or by hampering the enforcement of a court order.chambers,at citations removed.harassing the opposing party,delaying or disrupting litigation,hampering the enforcement of a court order,or making improper use of the courts are all examples of the sorts of conduct that will support a finding of bad faith or improper purpose given the requirements of the big yank test,however,these sorts of conduct can not be demonstrated solely by the fact that a party knowingly pursued a meritless claim or action.
having clarified the law as to when a district court may properly assess sanctions under its inherent power,we turn to the question of whether,in this case,the district court abused its discretion in imposin
