john doe appeals from a contempt order and an order compelling him to comply with a grand jury subpoena entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york joseph bianco,judge.with respect to any foreign bank accounts in which doe has a financial interest,the subpoena seeks records that the bank secrecy act bsa requires doe to maintain.see c.doe resists,asserting that the fifth amendment privilege against applies to his delivery of the requested documents.the district court held that requiring doe to produce the subpoenaed documents,over his objections,did not violate doe right against self incrimination because that the documents were required records records whose creation and preservation serves a legitimate governmental regulatory interest.in re grand jury subpoena dated february,d.doe contends both that the required records doctrine no longer exists and that,if it does,it does not apply to his case.we are not persuaded and affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
a federal grand jury in the eastern district of new york issued a subpoena to doe calling for him to produce records of his foreign bank accounts,including the names of the account holders,the banks,the account numbers,the type of the account,and the maximum value of the all information that must by law be reported to the commissioner of internal revenue.doe did not comply.the government moved to compel doe to produce the documents and doe continued to resist.the district court granted the government motion.subpoena dated february,d.doe still refused to comply,and thereafter the district court entered an order holding doe in contempt for failure to produce the records.the court imposed a sanction suspended pending his appeal of per day until he complies.
discussion 
doe contends that the fifth amendment insulates him from a contempt order based on his refusal to comply.he claims that the grand jury subpoena requires him either to produce documents that might incriminate him or to confirm that he failed to register his foreign bank accounts,which itself could be incriminating.the government counters that while doe might otherwise have legitimate fifth amendment concerns,the subject documents are records required by federal law,and that the government has a legitimate regulatory interest in requiring doe,and others like him,to maintain records of offshore accounts.accordingly,the government contends,it is entitled to demand that doe produce the records.thus,we are presented with the question of whether the subpoenaed records fall within the aptly named required records exception to the fifth amendment act of production privilege.we hold that it does.
i.the act of production privilege under the fifth amendment 
the fifth amendment act of production privilege was first articulated in fisher united states.fisher recognizes that the fifth amendment privilege might protect an individual from being required to produce documents,even if the documents contents are not protected by the privilege,when the witness simple act of producing the documents could be used against the witness for example,in those cases when the simple fact that the witness possessed the documents would be incriminating.
in fisher the court addressed a consolidated challenge by two clients whose lawyers were compelled to produce their tax records.accountants had prepared each client tax records and given them to their respective clients,who in turn gave them to their attorneys for legal advice.at.the court held 
the act of producing evidence in response to a subpoena has communicative aspects of its own,wholly aside from the contents of the papers produced.compliance with the subpoena tacitly concedes the existence of the papers demanded and their possession or control by the taxpayer.it also would indicate the taxpayer belief that the papers are those described in the subpoena.
id.at.in fisher,the only incriminating aspect of the documents was their content,not their existence.id.at.as a result,the privilege did not apply.
the fisher court noted that previously the proposition that the fifth amendment prevents compelled production of documents over objection that such production might incriminate stem med from boyd united states.at.however,the court described boyd protections of private papers heavily dependent on the theory that the privacy interests protected in the fourth amendment also figure in fifth amendment inquiries as a rule searching for a rationale consistent with the proscriptions of the fifth amendment against compelling a person to give testimony that incriminates him.id.at.instead of reaffirming boyd distinction,fisher articulated a new way of thinking about the fifth amendment privilege 
over years after fisher,the court articulated a robust act of production privilege in united states hubbell,a wire fraud prosecution stemming from the whitewater investigation.hubbell resisted initial subpoenas by asserting his fifth amendment rights the government granted him use immunity for the act of production and then indicted him based on the content rather than the production of the pages of documents that he produced.id.at.the court held that the content of the documents could not be used against hubbell,in light of the testimonial nature of hubbell extensive efforts in identifying and producing them.id.at.
the documents did not magically appear in the prosecutor office like manna from heaven.they arrived there only after respondent asserted his constitutional privilege,received a grant of immunity,the compulsion of the district court the mental and physical steps necessary to provide the prosecutor with an accurate inventory of the many sources of potentially incriminating evidence sought by the subpoena.
id.at.the court differentiated fisher,where the irs knew that the subpoenaed documents were in the possession of the taxpayers attorneys.id.at.in hubbell,the government had not shown that it had any prior knowledge of either the existence or the whereabouts of the pages of documents ultimately produced by respondent.id.at.it was unquestionably necessary for respondent to make extensive use of the contents of his own mind in identifying the hundreds of documents responsive to the requests in the subpoena.id.at quoting curcio united states.the government was therefore forbidden to use even the contents of the records and the court affirmed the dismissal of the indictment.id.at.
the privilege has thus evolved since its inception to a broader prophylactic regime that,in certain circumstances,protects individuals from producing documents where they are incriminated by the contents of the documents.see id.as applied,the privilege is practical it inoculates people from being forced to contribute to their own prosecution while not unduly restricting grand juries ability to seek the truth.doe argues and the government does not meaningfully contest that absent an exception,the act of production privilege shields doe from complying with the grand jury subpoena.
ii.the required records doctrine 
origins and interpretations 
the act of production privilege contains exceptions,and among them is the required records doctrine,first articulated in shapiro united states.the required records exception applies only when the fifth amendment privilege would otherwise allow a witness to avoid producing incriminating documents.it abrogates the protection of the privilege for a subset of those documents that must be maintained by law.
shapiro was a prosecution of a fruit purveyor for illegal pricing under the emergency price control act during the second world war.id.at.shapiro,the wholesaler,was served with a subpoena in september for invoices and other business information required to be kept pursuant to section of maximum price regulation.and.id.at.although the court acknowledged that there are limits which the government can not constitutionally exceed in requiring the keeping of records which may be used in prosecuting statutory violations committed by the himself,the court nonetheless compelled disclosure of these documents.id.at.
subsequently,the court set forth a test to determine whether documents are required records.f irst,the purposes of the united states inquiry must be essentially regulatory second,information is to be obtained by requiring the preservation of records of a kind which the regulated party has customarily kept and third,the records themselves must have assumed public aspects which render them at least analogous to public documents.grosso united states.
in grosso sister case,the court applied the test to find the required records exception inapplicable.marchetti united states.marchetti asserted his fifth amendment privilege in response to a prosecution under a statutory scheme that required illegal gamblers to register and pay an occupational tax.id.at see also grosso,at.marchetti was not inclined to disclose his illegal gambling for good reason.by maintaining receipts of his illegal gambling successes or failures he admitted to a crime.those who break the law understandably are unlikely to register their misdeeds with the government.
even assuming that the united states principal interest was the collection of revenue,and not the punishment of gamblers,the court found that shapiro was distinguishable.marchetti,at.the records were not of the same kind as he has customarily kept there were no public aspects to the records at issue and the records were collected about a group largely or entirely defined by their illegal activities.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also grosso,at deciding the same thing in the context of a gambler refusal to pay excise taxes and the occupation tax because h ere,as in marchetti,the statutory obligations are directed almost exclusively to individuals inherently suspect of criminal activities.marchetti refusal to comply with the statute was protected by the fifth amendment and not subject to the required records exception.id.at.his conviction was overturned.
interaction with the act of production privilege 
doe and amicus contend that the required records doctrine is no longer valid or that it applies only in exigent circumstances.to support this argument,they point out that shapiro was a wartime case that drew heavily on the reasoning of boyd united states,which has been either reconfigured or abrogated by the fisher line of cases.prior precedents of this court squarely foreclose this argument.
courts have consistently applied the required records doctrine and its analytical framework as an exception to the fifth amendment privilege,long after the expiration of any exigency.see,baltimore city dep t of social servs.bouknight.this court has twice explicitly rejected the idea that the required records exception has been abrogated by the act of production cases.in re two grand jury subpoenae duces tecum dated,cir two subpoenae in re doe,cir.
a psychiatrist associated with a clinic that freely distributed quaaludes to patients without medical need was required to turn over subpoenaed w and prescription forms along with patient files.in re doe,at.conceding that even shapiro recognizes constitutional limits on the government power to compel record keeping which might circumvent the privilege contained in the fifth amendment,we held that there wa s a strong correlation between the purpose of the new york law which require d that patient files be kept and that for which their production wa s sought.id.at.finally,we rejected the argument that the act of production privilege recognized in fisher shielded the records from disclosure 
t he required records doctrine is an exception to the fifth amendment privilege.as such,it necessarily overrides the privilege in instances in which the privilege would otherwise apply.fisher was not concerned with required records and nothing in its analysis could be construed as weakening the required records exception.
id.at emphasis in original,internal citations omitted.
three years later,an attorney appealed a contempt order entered because of his failure to comply with subpoenas related to contingency fee arrangements with his clients.two subpoenae,at.after noting that the fee documents were not covered by the privilege,this court rejected the lawyer fifth amendment argument based in part on the fact that the subpoenaed retainer agreements and closing statements fall within the required records exception to the fifth amendment.id.at.although the lawyer claim ed that the required records exception to the fifth amendment is no longer valid after the supreme court decision in united states doe,we noted that doe did not involve required records,and found nothing in its act of production analysis that c ould be construed as weakening the required records exception.id.internal citation omitted.we further explained the rationale for the required records exception 
first,if a person conducts an activity in which is required by statute or rule,he may be deemed to have waived his privilege with respect to the act of production at least in cases in which there is a nexus between the government production request and the purpose of the requirement.second,because the records must be kept by law,the admits little in the way of control or authentication by producing them.
two subpoenae,at 
based in part on the two subpoenae reasoning,this court still recognizes the required records exception.in,we applied the exception to information obtained from immigrants from specified countries who had responded to a mandatory registration program following the attacks of september.see rajah mukasey,cir.information obtained under this program was ultimately used by the government in the immigrants deportation proceedings.this court denied the immigrants attempts to block the use of the records through the fifth amendment because the fifth amendment act of production privilege does not cover records that are required to be kept pursuant to a civil regulatory regime.id.at.the required records exception remains a part of fifth amendment jurisprudence.
application of the required records doctrine to the bsa 
applying the grosso test,several circuits have specifically held that the required records exception applies to cases indistinguishable from the present cases.see united states under seal,cir,in re grand jury proceedings,cir in re grand jury subpoena,cir in re special february grand jury subpoena dated september,cir in re,cir.for the reasons stated below,we agree with our sister circuits.
the essentially regulatory test 
the first grosso prong asks whether the record requirement is essentially regulatory.this precludes congress from circumventing the fifth amendment privilege by enacting comprehensive legislation directed at a selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.marchetti,at quoting albertson subversive activities control.when legislation is not directed at the public at large and concerns an area permeated with criminal statutes,courts are more likely to hold that the required records exception does not apply.albertson,at.in addition to illegal gambling,courts have declined to apply the required records exception to records regarding marijuana sales,ownership of dangerous firearms,and other area s permeated with criminal statutes,haynes united states,internal quotation marks omitted,but have applied the exception in the context of drivers involved in automobile accidents,custodians of children,and even various sections of the bsa.
determining the target population of a statute is frequently difficult.in california byers,the supreme court examined a california statute in the context of all persons who drive automobiles in california,despite the statute facial applicability only to people who have been involved in automobile accidents resulting in damage to property.id.driving an automobile,unlike gambling,is a lawful activity.moreover,it is not a criminal offense under california law to be a driver involved in an accident.id.at.
similarly,this court upheld a conviction under the bsa for failure to report carrying over in cash when leaving the country.united states dichne,cir.we noted that the reporting requirement had incriminating potential while also serving legitimate social interests as a result,a balance must be struck between the competing interest of the state and the individual when evaluating the constitutionality of a disclosure requirement.id.at citing byers,at.because the transportation of such amounts of currency is by no means an illegal act in itself,as such the statute can not be faulted as being aimed at an inherently suspect group.id.at.in each of the supreme court cases holding a reporting requirement invalid,the reporting individual was required to reveal to the government information which would almost necessarily provide the basis for criminal proceedings against him for the very activity that he was required to disclose.id.at.insofar as transporting large amounts of money across international borders is indicative of other illegal activity,this is still short of requiring reporting from users of marijuana or gamblers,who would be reporting the exact activity for which they would be susceptible for prosecution.
dichne and other cases concluding that the bsa purpose is essentially regulatory are informative but not dispositive with respect to the provisions at issue here.our inquiry is not whether the bsa as a whole was motivated by civil or criminal concerns,but rather whether the specific section in question is essentially regulatory or directed at an area permeated with criminal statutes.byers,at quoting albertson,at.
the record keeping regulation at issue here,targets those engaged in the lawful activity of owning a foreign bank account.there is nothing inherently illegal about having or being a beneficiary of an offshore foreign bank account,at.doe protestations notwithstanding,owners of these accounts are not inherently suspect and the statute is essentially regulatory.
doe argument that the statute is criminally focused has some force.the bsa declares that its purpose is to require certain reports or records where they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal,tax,or regulatory investigations or proceedings,or in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities,including analysis,to protect against international terrorism.it does list criminal investigations first,but this multifaceted statute clearly contributes to civil and intelligence efforts wholly unrelated to any criminal purpose 
although portions of the statute legislative history support doe characterization of the bsa as focused on criminal activity,t he supreme court has already considered and rejected these arguments as they relate to the bsa generally,at citing cal.bankers ass shultz.moreover,the question is not whether congress was subjectively concerned about crime when enacting the bsa recordkeeping and reporting provisions,but rather whether these requirements apply exclusively or almost exclusively to people engaged in criminal activity.grand jury proceedings,at accord grand jury subpoena,at.looking beyond congressional subjective intent if there could be such a thing the bsa has considerable regulatory utility outside of the criminal justice context.
the question becomes whether a statute with mixed criminal and civil purposes can be essentially regulatory with respect to the required records exception.we agree with our sister circuits the fact t hat a statute relates both to criminal law and to civil regulatory matters does not strip the statute of its status as essentially regulatory.grand jury proceedings,at.because people owning foreign bank accounts are not inherently guilty of criminal activity,the bsa applicable recordkeeping requirement,designed to facilitate criminal,tax,or regulatory investigations or proceedings,or the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities,is still essentially regulatory.
doe argues that our reliance on dichne and other cases involving ex post challenges to the validity of statutory reporting requirements are distinguishable from individual assertions of the privilege against.these two categories of challenges are indeed distinct.however,supreme court precedent asks us to inquire into the purposes of the regulatory scheme pursuant to which records are required a necessarily generalized inquiry,and a matter discussed in cases like dichne.at.besides,in this case as in shapiro itself the witness asserted the privilege against in response to the subpoena issued.see shapiro,at.shapiro did more than set the constitutional parameters for requirements it determined that the fifth amendment is not a barrier to the enforcement of a valid civil regulatory scheme.special february grand jury subpoena dated september,at.the fact that the specific records sought would support a criminal prosecution did not defeat the essentially regulatory prong in that case the analysis does not come out differently here.the bsa recordkeeping requirement at issue,is essentially regulatory for the purposes of the required records analysis.
the customarily kept requirement 
the second grosso prong requires that the regulated information is to be obtained by requiring the preservation of records of a kind which the regulated party has customarily kept.grosso,at doe points to no cases in which any court has held that records are not required because they are not customarily kept.
the records required by are very basic they shall contain the name in which each account is maintained,the number or other designation of such account,the name and address of the foreign bank or other person with whom such account is maintained,the type of such account,and the maximum value of each such account during the reporting period.in determining that the records at issue are customarily kept,the district court relied in large part on the fact that another section of the bsa requires foreign account holders to report substantially identical information to the irs.see a.doe contends that this reasoning is tautological in that it permits congress to manufacture a custom in order to satisfy the required records doctrine by requiring that the records be kept.we need not address whether,in another case,records customarily kept only because they are required by law satisfy the prerequisites of the required records doctrine.
here,the grand jury subpoena seeks information so basic that the argument that these records are not customarily kept is a.grand jury proceedings,at.a bank account beneficiary necessarily has access to such essential information as the bank name,the maximum amount held in the account each year,and the account number,at.c ommon sense dictates that beneficiaries keep these records in part because they need the information to access their foreign bank accounts.id.the amount of money in the account is relevant to most foreign bank account holders in that many people are regularly forced to assess prospective purchases against the balance of their accounts.most people check a bank account before making a major purchase not everyone who holds a foreign bank account could,without a second thought,incur for example vast litigation costs in a feckless attempt to avoid paying taxes vital to the functioning of the united states without needing to assess whether losing such a challenge would leave them incapable of paying the inevitable hefty sanctions.and even if the account holder is a person of great wealth surely they want to know where that wealth is located.
doe believes that,despite the basic presumption that bank account owners know the location of their money,some individuals engaged in wrongdoing are advised not to keep even this basic information but even if those who possess foreign bank accounts for the purposes of avoiding some specific tax or criminal laws may be less likely to maintain these records,the bsa covers the entire group of foreign bank account holders.we decline to look at the custom of only the miscreants among the larger group of foreign bank account holders.
the public aspects prong 
the third grosso prong asks whether the required records have assumed public aspects which render them at least analogous to public documents.grand jury proceedings,at quoting grosso,at.the parties dispute the meaning of the public aspects test,which as a vestige of boyd may not have the same legal significance as it did in,when the public priva
