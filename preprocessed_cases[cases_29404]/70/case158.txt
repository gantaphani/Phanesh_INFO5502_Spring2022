we consider here the standard district courts should employ in determining whether a party failure to comply with discovery requests warrants the imposition of sanctions.
degeorge financial,degeorge home alliance,and degeorge capital collectively,degeorge appeal from a final judgment in favor of residential funding corporation rfc entered by the united states district court for the district of connecticut janet bond arterton,judge after a jury trial on for breach of contract.on appeal,degeorge challenges only the district court denial of its motion for the form of an adverse inference rfc failure to produce certain in time for trial.the district court denied the motion based on its finding that the delay in producing the was not caused by an action of rfc that was taken in bad faith or with gross negligence and its finding that degeorge had not shown that the missing would be favorable to its case.
we hold that where,as here,the nature of the alleged breach of a discovery obligation is the of evidence,a district court has broad discretion in fashioning an appropriate sanction,including the discretion to delay the start of a trial at the expense of the party that breached its obligation,to declare a mistrial if trial has already commenced,or to proceed with a trial with an adverse inference instruction discovery sanctions,including an adverse inference instruction,may be imposed where a party has breached a discovery obligation not only through bad faith or gross negligence,but also through ordinary negligence a judge finding that a party acted with gross negligence or in bad faith with respect to discovery obligations is ordinarily sufficient to support a finding that the missing or destroyed evidence would have been harmful to that party,even if the destruction or unavailability of the evidence was not caused by the acts constituting bad faith or gross negligence and in the instant case,the district court applied the wrong standard in deciding degeorge motion for sanctions.
accordingly,we vacate the order of the district court denying degeorge motion for sanctions and remand with instructions for a renewed hearing on discovery sanctions.
background 
this litigation involved for,inter alia,breach of contract,with the parties dispute centered principally on events in the latter part of.rfc initiated the case by filing suit on january,in minnesota state court.degeorge counterclaimed on february.
on may,degeorge filed a petition for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court in the district of delaware.the bankruptcy proceeding was subsequently transferred to the district of connecticut.
after the bankruptcy filing,rfc removed the minnesota state court action to the united states district court for the district of minnesota.on january,that court transferred the case,on the parties joint request,to the district of connecticut.
on april,rfc moved to refer the case to the bankruptcy court,and,on july,it moved to stay discovery.after an extended briefing period,the district court denied both motions on december.
on january,the parties held a discovery planning conference pursuant to rules b and f of the federal rules of civil procedure and rule of the local rules of the district of connecticut.report of parties planning meeting dated january,at.at that meeting,the parties agreed that discovery would commence immediately and be completed by august,and that the case would be ready for trial by september.id.at.on january,the district court entered a scheduling order reflecting the parties discovery schedule.scheduling order on counterclaim dated january,at.
on april,degeorge served its document discovery requests,which included a request for all documents,including electronic mail,relating to degeorge.rfc responded to degeorge document requests on may,and asserted no objection to the request for.
during the first week of june,the parties agreed that they would work diligently to obtain hard copies of emails that were in computer form so that they could have a mutual production of emails.e mail from attorney harris to attorney weinstein re production of emails,dated june.on june,rfc told degeorge that it was in the process of retrieving from the tapes and that it would let degeorge know when it had an estimate on a production date for the that are being retrieved off of the storage tapes.from weinstein to harris re production of emails,dated june.
in,after rfc lawyer responsible for technology issues determined that rfc did not have the internal resources necessary to retrieve the from the tapes in the permitted time frame,decl.of michael mcguire,dated,rfc retained electronic evidence discovery,eed to assist rfc in the retrieval project.id.
in early july,rfc informed degeorge that it had been unable to retrieve any emails from its tapes.degeorge requested copies of the tapes so that it could have its technical experts attempt to retrieve from them,and indicated its willingness to enter into any requested confidentiality agreement.from harris to weinstein re refusal to produce back up tapes,dated july.rfc refused to produce the tapes,prompting degeorge to raise the issue with the district court.see id.
on july,at a settlement conference before magistrate judge joan margolis,degeorge raised the issue of rfc refusal to produce or tapes.the parties agree that rfc told magistrate judge margolis that it was going to engage a vendor to retrieve the emails.see rfc memorandum opposing mot.for sanctions at degeorge mot.for sanctions at at that time,rfc represented to the magistrate judge and degeorge that it would hire a vendor to retrieve the emails.appellants br.at same the parties understood at the july,conference that rfc would produce with the assistance of a vendor.
on or about july,eed apparently informed counsel for rfc that it would take a couple of weeks for it to print out the and transmit them to counsel for review.see tr.of telephone conf.of august,at.rfc,in turn,informed degeorge that day that it would begin producing responsive on a rolling basis starting on august.from weinstein to harris re emails,dated july.it represented that the would take a few weeks to produce.id.at this point,discovery was set to close on august,with jury selection to begin on september.supplemental scheduling order,dated july.
rfc did not begin producing on august,as it had promised.instead,it informed degeorge on august,that it was continuing work on the production of and that s o far,most of the printouts it had received from eed are completely unrelated to the case.from weinstein to ross re prd boxes,dated august.
by august,degeorge still had not received any production of from rfc.accordingly,it raised the matter in a conference call with judge arterton on that date.see tr.of telephone,dated august,at.rfc informed judge arterton that it had encountered technical difficulties,but that it expected to complete production in the next couple of weeks.id.at.judge arterton ordered that production of the be completed by august.id.at.

on august,rfc produced dating from january through early august,and from september.there were no produced from october to december critical factual time period.
degeorge immediately inquired as to the reason there were no from the end of.e mail from harris to hall et re emails produced from back up tapes,dated august,at see also e mail from harris to weinstein et re emails produced from back up tapes,dated august,at rfc responded that i f there were no responsive for it was either because there were no responsive from that date or because they did not exist on the accessible tapes.from weinstein to harris et re emails produced from back up tapes,dated august,at on august,rfc confirmed that it had been unable to retrieve october december for production from rfc tapes.letter from weinstein to harris,dated august.
on august,rfc produced additional responsive retrieved from tapes,none of which were from october to december.
on september,degeorge again asked rfc to produce the tapes so that it could investigate why no had been produced from the critical time period.on september,rfc agreed to provide the tapes on the condition that any degeorge vendor was able to retrieve be sent to rfc for review rather than to degeorge.the next morning,after initially rejecting the condition,degeorge agreed to rfc terms in an sent at from harris to hall et.re back up tapes for emails,dated.in that,degeorge requested that the tapes be made available the next morning at jury selection.id.rfc did not produce the tapes at jury selection instead,it sent them by overnight courier on september,see letter from weinstein to harris,dated,so that degeorge did not receive them until the morning of september,days before trial was to begin.
although rfc turned over the tapes,it refused to answer degeorge questions regarding what type of tapes had been produced and their technical degeorge sought to assist its vendor in reading the tapes.instead,rfc took the position that it had fulfilled its discovery obligations by producing the tapes,and that degeorge vendor should just try to figure it out as rfc vendor had done.degeorge brought rfc recalcitrance to the attention of the district court in a telephone conference held that day september,during which rfc agreed to answer degeorge questions see rfc mem.opposing degeorge mot.for sanctions at.
the next,asked rfc to ask its vendor why it could not retrieve anything from the october december tapes.rfc responded that the reason no were produced for from the tapes you received was either due to the fact that some of the tapes were physically damaged or corrupted or some tapes did not have on them at all.from weinstein to harris re emails,dated september.
within four days of obtaining the tapes,working a normal eight hour day,degeorge vendor had located on the november and december tapes.aff.of don wells,dated.by september,the vendor had begun forwarding printed to rfc counsel for review and production.id.because of time pressure,the parties agreed that rfc would produce all of the that degeorge vendor had been able to print out rfc did so in court on september.ultimately,thirty of the were responsive,though none appear to be damaging to rfc.
on september,degeorge moved for sanctions,asking judge arterton to instruct the jury that it should presume the emails from october to december of,which have not been produced,would have disproved rfc theory of the case.the next day,during oral argument on the motion,rfc counsel described rfc retention of eed as follows 
i believe that as early as we began contacting electronic evidence discovery,who is our vendor that helped us retrieve the.and as we represented to the magistrate on july,we were getting help doing this.
trial tr.at.
in response to judge arterton question regarding why rfc had not produced the tapes earlier,rfc counsel stated 
it was a decision that we made internally that we endeavored to work with a world class vendor to achieve achieve a result that would be satisfactory both for degeorge and for the court,and we have yet to see that they would have been able to do any better.
replying to judge arterton question regarding why rfc had not turned over tapes created in early so as to insure that all of the december were captured,rfc counsel told the district court that rfc had produced tapes from as late as february of and january of.id.at.in fact,however,rfc had not produced any tapes.
in an oral ruling the next morning september,judge arterton denied degeorge motion.she held that,to obtain an adverse inference charge,a party must show that the party with control over the evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the time it was destroyed the party that destroyed the evidence had a sufficiently culpable state of mind and some evidence suggest s that a document or documents relevant to substantiating the claim of the party seeking sanctions would have been included among the destroyed files.trial tr.at quoting byrnie town of cromwell,cir.rfc did not dispute that it had an obligation to preserve and produce the accordingly,judge arterton focused on the latter two prongs of the analysis.see id.at.
with respect to the second prong,judge arterton found,citing reilly natwest markets group,cir,that degeorge was not entitled to an adverse inference instruction because it had not established that rfc acted with bad faith or gross negligence.she gave two reasons for this conclusion.first,she found that rfc explanation that it decided to use an outside vendor to retrieve the rather than turn over the tapes was neither implausible nor unreasonable,and it was that decision that led to much of the delay.second,although she recognized that 
subsequent acts by rfc,including representation that would be produced,without mentioning the absence of any from the critical time period,a missed federal express deadline for sending backup tapes so they could be forwarded to degeorge vendors,and resistance to responding to technical questions about the tapes,suggests a somewhat purposeful sluggishness on rfc part,
id.at,she found that these acts would not have resulted in the unavailability of the evidence absent the compressed timeline both parties were operating under.id.at.
judge arterton also held that degeorge had failed to establish that the would be helpful to it,as it ha d not identified anything,apart from the nonproduction itself,suggesting that the unproduced would likely have been harmful to rfc.id.at.
mindful that the had not been destroyed but rather not timely produced,judge arterton noted that 
should material evidence surface that is adverse to rfc after trial from the eventual disclosure of these,it might be the basis for motions,since it would obviously appear to fit within the category of being newly discovered and unavailable at the time of trial.
that day september,was the last day evidence was presented in the case.the following monday,september,the jury heard closing arguments,received the charge,and reached a verdict in favor of rfc for million.judgment on the jury verdict was entered on september.this appeal followed.
on appeal,degeorge argues that the district court erred in holding a that it was required to establish bad faith or gross negligence to show that rfc acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind so as to warrant sanctions,and b that it was required to show that the would have been harmful to rfc and the district court denial of its motion for sanctions was based on a clearly erroneous view of the evidence.degeorge br.at.degeorge asks us to vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for a new trial.
ii.discussion 
a.the nature of the alleged breach of a discovery obligation 
at the outset we note that,although the relief degeorge requested in its motion for sanctions was an adverse inference instruction,which usually is employed in cases involving spoliation of evidence,and the district court accordingly decided degeorge motion using our law on adverse inference instructions in the context of spoliation,this is not a typical spoliation case.it does not appear that rfc destroyed the on the tapes.rather,rfc failed to produce the in time for trial.accordingly,this case is more akin to those in which a party breaches a discovery obligation or fails to comply with a court order regarding discovery.
rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure provides,in relevant part,that if a party fails to obey a discovery order,the court may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just,including,but not limited to,a n order that designated facts shall be taken as established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order.b a.rule b also provides that,in lieu of or in addition to any other appropriate order,
the court shall require the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising that party or both to pay the reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,caused by the failure,unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.
b emphasis added.even in the absence of a discovery order,a court may impose sanctions on a party for misconduct in discovery under its inherent power to manage its own affairs.dlc management town of hyde park,cir.see generally chambers nasco,d it has long been understood that c ertain implied powers must necessarily result to our courts of justice from the nature of their institution,powers which can not be dispensed with in a court,because they are necessary to the exercise of all others.quoting united states hudson,cranch.
where,as here,the nature of the alleged breach of a discovery obligation is the of evidence,a district court has broad discretion in fashioning an appropriate sanction,including the discretion to delay the start of a trial at the expense of the party that breached its obligation,to declare a mistrial if trial has already commenced,or to proceed with a trial and give an adverse inference instruction.see reilly natwest markets group,cir whether exercising its inherent power,or acting pursuant to rule,a district court has wide discretion in sanctioning a party for discovery abuses.in the instant case,however,degeorge chose not to seek a delay of the trial or a mistrial,but rather sought only an adverse inference instruction.accordingly,we will not disturb the district court denial of degeorge motion unless the district court abused its discretion in failing to give the requested instruction.
b.the district court denial of degeorge motion 
we review a district court decision on a motion for discovery sanctions for abuse of discretion.see,selletti carey,cir.a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.cooter gell hartmarx,d.in the instant case,degeorge contends that,in denying its motion for sanctions,the district court both made errors of law and based its ruling on a clearly erroneous view of the evidence.
the legal standard for an adverse inference instruction 
as the district court correctly held,a party seeking an adverse inference instruction based on the destruction of evidence must establish that the party having control over the evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the time it was destroyed that the records were destroyed with a culpable state of mind and that the destroyed evidence was relevant to the party claim or defense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that it would support that claim or defense.byrnie town of cromwell,cir.similarly,where,as here,an adverse inference instruction is sought on the basis that the evidence was not produced in time for use at trial,the party seeking the instruction must show that the party having control over the evidence had an obligation to timely produce it that the party that failed to timely produce the evidence had a culpable state of mind and that the missing evidence is relevant to the party claim or defense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that it would support that claim or defense.
rfc did not dispute in its opposition to degeorge motion that it had an obligation to preserve and timely produce the tapes.accordingly,the only issues before the district court were whether rfc acted with a culpable state of mind in failing to timely produce the and whether the missing are relevant to degeorge claim or defense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that they would support that claim or defense.
a.the proper legal standard for determining whether rfc acted with a culpable state of mind 
in determining whether rfc acted with a culpable state of mind,the district court specifically discussed only whether rfc acted in bad faith or with gross negligence.see trial tr.at.as we explicitly noted in byrnie,however,the culpable state of mind factor is satisfied by a showing that the evidence was destroyed knowingly,even if without intent to breach a duty to preserve it,or negligently.id.at emphasis added.reilly natwest markets group,which the district court cited,is not to the contrary in that case we held that a approach to the failure to produce relevant evidence was appropriate because s uch failures occur along a continuum of from innocence through the degrees of negligence to intentionality.at quoting welsh united states,cir.
the sanction of an adverse inference may be appropriate in some cases involving the negligent destruction of evidence because each party should bear the risk of its own negligence.as magistrate judge james francis,iv aptly put it,
the sanction of an adverse inference should be available even for the negligent destruction of documents if that is necessary to further the remedial purpose of the inference.it makes little difference to the party victimized by the destruction of evidence whether that act was done willfully or negligently.the adverse inference provides the necessary mechanism for restoring the evidentiary balance.the inference is adverse to the destroyer not because of any finding of moral culpability,but because the risk that the evidence would have been detrimental rather than favorable should fall on the party responsible for its loss.
turner hudson transit lines.see generally kronisch united states,cir stating that an adverse inference instruction serves the remedial purpose,insofar as possible,of restoring the prejudiced party to the same position he would have been in absent the wrongful destruction of evidence by the opposing party.
although the district court properly cited reiley and turner,it explicitly analyzed only whether rfc acted in bad faith or with gross negligence.it is therefore unclear whether the district court applied the proper legal standard.ordinarily,we would remand for clarification of this issue,but,in view of our analysis of the remaining issues in this case,such clarification is unnecessary.
b.the proper legal standard for determining whether degeorge adduced sufficient evidence that the missing are relevant 
although we have stated that,to obtain an adverse inference instruction,a party must establish that the unavailable evidence is relevant to its claims or defenses,byrnie,at kronisch,at,our cases make clear that relevant in this context means something more than sufficiently probative to satisfy rule of the federal rules of evidence rather,the party seeking an adverse inference must adduce sufficient evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could infer that the destroyed or unavailable evidence would have been of the nature alleged by the party affected by its destruction.kronisch,at byrnie,at.courts must take care not to hold the prejudiced party to too strict a standard of proof regarding the likely contents of the destroyed or unavailable evidence,because doing so would subvert the purposes of the adverse inference,and would allow parties who have destroyed evidence to profit from that destruction.kronisch,at byrnie,at.
where a party destroys evidence in bad faith,that bad faith alone is sufficient circumstantial evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the missing evidence was unfavorable to that party.see,kronisch,at it is a and principle of law that a party intentional destruction of evidence relevant to proof of an issue at trial can support an inference that the evidence would have been unfavorable to the party responsible for its destruction.similarly,a showing of gross negligence in the destruction or untimely production of evidence will in some circumstances suffice,standing alone,to support a finding that the evidence was unfavorable to the grossly negligent party.see reilly,at.accordingly,where a party seeking an adverse inference adduces evidence that its opponent destroyed potential evidence or otherwise rendered it unavailable in bad faith or through gross negligence satisfying the culpable state of mind factor,that same evidence of the opponent state of mind will frequently also be sufficient to permit a jury to conclude that the missing evidence is favorable to the party satisfying the relevance factor 
a party seeking an adverse inference in
