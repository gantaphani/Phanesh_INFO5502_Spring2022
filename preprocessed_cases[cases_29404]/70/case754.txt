background 
plaintiff morrie london london sued his former employer,corporation,and its president,herman kaiser,for wrongful termination,age and physical handicap discrimination,fraud,and other causes of action.
at the time of his termination,london managed copper shop and had worked at for nearly nine years.claims the primary reason for terminating london employment was his insubordination on march,and,and april and.also noted that london failure to operate the copper shop profitably and failure to maintain adequate inventory influenced the termination.
through an inspection demand,london sought to inspect documents related to the copper shop profitability and inventory.refused to produce most of these documents.it argued they were irrelevant and included confidential trade secrets.london moved to compel further response to his inspection demand,subd.m.
in ruling on the motion to compel,the trial court observed,ca have it both ways.ca buttress the reasons for termination with the copper shop poor profitability record and failure to maintain adequate inventory while in the next breath denying london discovery requests aimed at these issues based upon the argument that those issues are too remote or collateral to be investigated.as for the trade secret issue,the trial court had granted a protective order.
the trial court gave a choice.could file an election stating it would rely only on evidence of london insubordination on or after march.or,could fully comply with london inspection demand as to the requested documents.chose to file the evidentiary limitation.
the trial court asked london to set forth his fees and costs in litigating the motion to compel so the court could impose appropriate monetary sanctions against pursuant to section,subdivision m.london complied,but objected,arguing an award of sanctions absent notice and an opportunity to be heard violated due process.accepting this argument,the trial court refused to award sanctions absent a noticed motion conforming to the requirements of section.
london promptly filed a noticed motion requesting discovery monetary sanctions against.argued that this motion was untimely and,regardless,that it had successfully opposed london motion to compel further response.after hearing,the trial court granted the sanctions motion,directing to pay in costs and fees to london.appealed,subd.a.
discussion 
request for discovery monetary sanctions under section,subdivision m 
contends that london request for discovery monetary sanctions was untimely because it was not set forth in the motion to compel further response under section,subdivision m.we disagree.
two statutes are implicated section,which generally identifies the misuses of the discovery process and the types of discovery sanctions and section,which specifically governs the particular discovery method at issue production and inspection.subdivision b of section and subdivision m of section are the specific provisions at issue.
in pertinent part,section,subdivision b,provides 
b to the extent authorized by the section governing any particular discovery method,the court,after notice and opportunity for hearing,may impose the following sanctions against any one sic engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process.
the court may impose a monetary sanction,the reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct if a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this article,the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
in subdivisions b through b,section identifies the other types of discovery sanctions.these are,respectively,issue,evidence,terminating,and contempt sanctions.subdivision c of section adds that a request for a sanction shall,in the notice of motion,identify every person,party,and attorney against whom the sanction is sought,and specify the type of sanction sought.the notice of motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and authorities,and accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought.
section governs the particular discovery method in this case,which is inspection of documents,tangible things,and land or other property,subd.a.section,subdivision m,outlines the process for moving to compel further response to an inspection demand and the available sanctions for unsuccessfully making or opposing such a motion.it states in pertinent part 
m if the party demanding an inspection receives what it deems to be an incomplete,inadequate,or evasive response to an inspection demand,that party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand 
unless notice of this motion is given within days of the service of the response,the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to the inspection demand.
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under section against any party,person,or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to an inspection demand,unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
claims,and we agree,that section and the particular discovery method statute here,section,must be read together to determine what types of sanctions can be imposed and when.section,subdivision b,directs the reader to the particular discovery method statute,section,by stating,t o the extent authorized by the section governing any particular discovery method in circular fashion,section,subdivision m,directs the reader back to section,by stating,t he court shall impose a monetary sanction under section against any party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to an inspection demand 
the pivotal language to be interpreted here is the language in section,subdivision b,t o the extent authorized by the section governing any particular discovery method,the court,after notice and opportunity for hearing,may impose the following sanctions.italics added.
our objective in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.professional engineers wilson th,d.the first thing we do is read the statute and give the words their ordinary definitions unless special definitions are provided.id.at,d.if the meaning of the words is clear,then the language controls if not,we may use various interpretive aids.id.at,d.
the above italicized language from section,subdivision b,is ambiguous.does it mean to absorb all the procedural requirements set forth in the particular discovery method statute,or does it simply refer to whether a type of sanction is authorized for a specific abuse in the particular discovery statute 
interprets this language of section,subdivision b,as absorbing the procedural requirements of the applicable discovery method,section.argues that since a motion to compel further response under section,subdivision m,must be made within a time limit,so too must the movant request for monetary sanctions related to that motion therefore,such a request must be part of that motion.we see it differently.
on the issue of monetary sanctions,section,subdivision m,states that a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to an inspection demand shall be sanctioned under section unless doing so is unjustified.italics added.it follows that any party who successfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response can initiate sanctions by noticing the other party,per section.nothing in section,subdivision m,or elsewhere,suggests that the procedure for requesting discovery sanctions is different for a party who successfully makes
