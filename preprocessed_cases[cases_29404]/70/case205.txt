wachovia securities,llc wachovia appeals from the district court refusal to vacate an arbitration award entered against it after it sued several former employees on what the arbitrators determined were frivolous claims.wachovia argues that the arbitrators the panel violated a of the federal arbitration act the faa and manifestly disregarded the law when they awarded million in attorneys fees and costs under the south carolina frivolous civil proceedings act the fcpa,codified at ann.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
wachovia initiated an arbitration proceeding by filing a statement of claim with the financial industry regulatory authority finra against four former employees frank brand,stephen jones,marvin slaughter,and george stukes collectively,the former employees on june.the former employees,all individual financial advisors,were previously employees of edwards sons,which merged with wachovia on october.after the merger,the former employees became employees of wachovia florence,south carolina branch office.wachovia terminated their employment on june.following their termination by wachovia,the former employees went to work for a competitor brokerage firm,stifel nicolaus,stifel.
in the arbitration proceeding,wachovia alleged that the former employees had violated their contractual and common law obligations when they joined stifel specifically,wachovia claimed that the former employees conspired with stifel to open a competitor office in florence,south carolina,and that they had misappropriated confidential and proprietary information in the process.wachovia further complained that the former employees were soliciting current wachovia clients and employees to join their new firm.in addition,wachovia sought a permanent injunction,the return of records,and an award of costs and attorneys fees associated with the arbitration.it repeated these requests in its amended statement of claim filed on july.
the former employees answer described this dispute as meritless and an effort to punish former edwards employees for leaving in the wake of wachovia acquisition of edwards,to intimidate and deter its current employees from making similar decisions,to prevent customers from obtaining information necessary to make an informed decision as to whether the customer wishes to do business,and to otherwise stifle legitimate competition.the former employees requested that the panel award them attorneys fees and costs incurred in defending themselves from wachovia baseless and unwarranted claims.they also asserted counterclaims under the south carolina wage payment act wage act,codified at ann,and the common law doctrines of unjust enrichment and conversion.they did not assert any claims under the fcpa.
the arbitration proceeded before a panel of three arbitrators in accordance with finra rules for industry disputes.see finra.the first month of arbitration proceedings,during which both sides presented evidence,was unremarkable.then,on october,the panel asked the parties to submit accountings or proposals regarding requested attorneys fees,forum fees,expert fees and any costs or expenses during the final two days of hearings,scheduled for november and.wachovia requested that the parties brief the fees issues and the panel agreed,asking that the parties submit their briefs by november.there was no discussion of response briefs.
despite the deadline,wachovia was unprepared to submit its brief on fees on november,and requested a extension the panel permitted the extension,and the parties therefore submitted their briefs on november,the last planned day of hearings.both parties briefs contained new arguments regarding attorneys fees.wachovia argued,despite its own request for attorneys fees in its statement of claim,that under the south carolina arbitration act,neither party was entitled to attorneys fees.the former employees argued for the first time that they were entitled to attorneys fees under the fcpa.
as its name suggests,the frivolous civil proceeding act provides a mechanism for litigants to seek sanctions against attorneys who file frivolous claims.it contains a number of procedural safeguards for litigants facing sanctions.significantly for our purposes,the statute provides for a notice period affording the accused days to respond to a request for sanctions and a separate hearing on sanctions after the verdict.c.no such procedures were followed here.
upon learning that the former employees were seeking sanctions under the fcpa,wachovia expressed concern that the arbitrators were not affording them days response time or a hearing on the issue of fees.toward the end of the hearing on november,the chairman of the panel asked wachovia if you have been given a fair opportunity to present your case in its entirety in these proceedings.wachovia responded that it had not been given a fair opportunity with respect to the issues raised and argued as to attorneys fees.the panel then asked whether additional briefing would cure the concerns.wachovia replied 
i do know.because the standard and the fcpa from what i saw,there notice and opportunity to be heard.so that means in other words,we need some evidence.that why i do think it appropriate at the end,after our record is closed,that new issues have been injected.the statute is not referred to in the pleadings.so it not just the element of surprise.it a complete surprise.
after listening to wachovia objections to the panel reaching any decision on the issue of attorneys fees,the panel stated the issue on attorneys fees,i sure there will be something that will occur to the panel where we need to seek clarification from parties.and if that becomes necessary,be assured we will be in touch with you.b.the panel subsequently asked the parties for an accounting of their november fees but did not hold any additional hearings or request additional briefing.nor,however,did wachovia request additional briefing.
on december,the panel issued an award in which it denied all of wachovia claims.it awarded the former employees in treble damages on their wage act claims,as well as for attorneys fees under the fcpa.although the former employees had also sought attorneys fees under several south carolina statutes,the panel awarded them fees only under the fcpa and indicated that any and all claims not specifically addressed herein were denied.
following arbitration,the former employees filed a motion to confirm the panel award in the district of south carolina.wachovia filed its own motion to vacate that portion of the panel award granting relief to the former employees on january.it argued for vacatur on two grounds.first,it contended that the panel exceeded its authority and manifestly disregarded the law under a by awarding sanctions under the fcpa,for,inter alia,ignoring the fcpa conditions precedent.to further support its argument that the panel violated a,wachovia argued that the fcpa authorized a court to award fees after a verdict in a trial and was therefore inapplicable in arbitration proceedings since there is no court or trial.second,it contended that the panel deprived wachovia of a fundamentally fair hearing,by denying it the procedural safeguards guaranteed by the fcpa and by not allowing it to review much less rebut critical evidence that the former employees submitted to the panel in support of their fee claim.wachovia claimed that this denial provided grounds for vacatur under a.the district court considered these claims in turn.
the district court began by rejecting wachovia argument that the arbitrators violated a,which allows a district court to vacate an arbitration award where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.a.it reasoned that arbitrators violate this provision when they decide issues not properly before them.since the record supported the conclusion that the question of fees was properly before the panel,the district court held that they had not violated a.
the district court also disagreed with wachovia argument that a statute must mention arbitration in order to be applicable in arbitration.it further rejected wachovia claim that the language of the fcpa supported vacatur under a manifest disregard standard because the statute only applied to courts following a verdict.it reasoned that wachovia had not shown that the arbitrators understood the law as having a meaning that they chose to ignore.
turning to wachovia claim that the panel was guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party had been prejudiced in violation of a,the court noted that any deficiencies in the hearing were of wachovia own creation since it missed the deadline for filing its brief and declined the panel offer to consider additional briefing.wachovia appealed.
wachovia appeals the district court holding that the arbitrators neither violated a nor that they manifestly disregarded the law.wachovia has not made any claims directly under a in this appeal,but instead argues that manifest disregard is a judicial gloss on a and.
we begin our examination of wachovia claims by first looking at the narrow standard of review that guides our analysis.next,we consider wachovia contention that a requires that we overturn the award.finding that the plain language of the statute offers wachovia no relief,we then turn to its argument that it is entitled to vacatur because the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law.we reject that contention as well.

turning now to wachovia argument that a requires vacatur,we begin by noting that the faa limits courts ability to vacate arbitral awards as part of its comprehensive scheme to replace judicial hostility to arbitration with a national policy favoring it.hall street assocs.mattel,d we are,therefore,hesitant to read any of grounds for vacatur too broadly.by its terms,a allows courts to vacate arbitration awards only where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.a.
in this appeal,wachovia argues that the panel was guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing or in refusing to hear evidence in violation of a when it failed to hold a separate hearing on the issue of attorneys fees.wachovia complains that the fcpa provides for certain procedural safeguards,which the panel did not follow,and that it was denied the opportunity to present evidence on this issue.this argument fails for several reasons.
first,wachovia has cited no authority for the proposition that state procedural requirements must be imported into arbitration.in international union mine workers marrowbone development,cir,we said that a n arbitrator typically retains broad discretion over procedural matters and does not have to hear every piece of evidence that the parties wish to present.wachovia argues that it was entitled to days to respond after the former employees requested fcpa sanctions on november,and that the panel should have scheduled a hearing at which it could present evidence about attorneys fees.in short,wachovia argues that the panel must comply with the fcpa procedural provisions if it relies on the fcpa substantive provisions when awarding attorneys fees.in at t mobility llc concepcion,d,which held that the faa preempted a california rule holding that any contract that disallowed class proceedings was unconscionable,the supreme court explained that the informality of arbitral proceedings is itself desirable,reducing the cost and increasing the speed of dispute resolution.id.at.parties may,of course,consent to particular procedures in arbitration,but it is inconsistent with the faa for one party to demand ex post particular procedural requirements from state law.id.at.we similarly conclude that the panel was not compelled to follow the fcpa procedural mandates insofar as wachovia attempts to import them into this arbitration.
second,even if we were to hold that fcpa procedures do apply in arbitration,wachovia challenge to the panel procedure would nevertheless fail because it does not allege misconduct.in marrowbone,this court held that an arbitrator procedural ruling may not be overturned unless it was in bad faith or so gross as to amount to affirmative misconduct.at quotation marks omitted.this ruling closely tracks the plain language of a,which authorizes vacatur where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing or in refusing to hear evidence or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.in the context of a,misconduct and misbehavior are different from mistake.the former two imply that the arbitrators intentionally contradicted the law.wachovia has not argued any such intentionality.instead,it argues that the arbitrators made a mistake in how they handled the former employees fcpa claim.mistakes lack the requisite intentionality to fall within a reach.because wachovia did not allege intentional misconduct,a offers it no relief.
wachovia attempts to get around this deficiency in its reliance on a by pointing to our decision in marrowbone,in which we said that courts owe no deference to an arbitrator who has failed to provide the parties with a full and fair hearing.at.we interpreted marrowbone and a in three s delaware,where we said a federal court is entitled to vacate an arbitration award only if the arbitrator refusal to hear pertinent and material evidence deprives a party to the proceeding of a fundamentally fair hearing.at.wachovia argues that the panel refusal to schedule another day of hearings at which it could present evidence on the question of attorneys fees deprived it of a fundamentally fair hearing.we disagree.
to the contrary,we find that wachovia is the architect of its own misfortune.wachovia,not the arbitrators,cut short the hearing on the issue of attorneys fees.the arbitrators set the deadline for submitting briefs on the issue of attorneys fees for the penultimate day of hearings.wachovia inexplicably missed this deadline and submitted its brief on the final day of arbitration,thereby leaving no time for the parties to debate the issue.moreover,after wachovia complained that it had not received a fair hearing on the issue of fees,the arbitrators asked wachovia if it wanted to submit additional briefs.wachovia turned down this opportunity.even if wachovia is correct in its contention that the fcpa requires a hearing in the context of arbitration,it could have used the additional briefing to explain why a hearing was necessary.
as noted above,arbitrators have broad discretion to set applicable procedure.see marrowbone,at.accordingly,we will not overturn an award for violating a protection against any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced where the arbitrators attempted to address one party unhappiness with the fairness of the hearing and that party refused to take advantage of the opportunity provided.
we turn now to wachovia argument that it is entitled to vacatur under a manifest disregard standard.specifically,wachovia argues that the panel manifestly disregarded the law when it refused to import the fcpa procedural requirements into the arbitration.manifest disregard is,as we will explain,an old yet enigmatic ground for overturning arbitral awards.wac
