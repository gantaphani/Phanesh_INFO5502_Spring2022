brian hollnagel and bci aircraft leasing appeal the district court order holding them in contempt and awarding attorney fees for their failure to adequately respond to two subpoenas duces tecum served on them by the securities and exchange commission s ec in connection with litigation between the sec and another party.the sec initiated the contempt proceeding via a motion for a rule to show cause why hollnagel and bci should not be held in contempt.the motion asked the court to order them to fully comply with the subpoenas and order them to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for their past noncompliance.accompanying this motion was a notice setting a date and time for a hearing at which the sec said it would present,and seek a hearing date regarding its request for a order.hollnagel and bci interpreted the notice and motion to mean that the initial hearing would be entirely the court would issue a order and set another date on which the merits of the contempt issue would be heard.so they did show up.
when the case was called and hollnagel and bci did appear,the sec skipped over the procedural preliminaries and moved right to the main event the agency lawyers asked the court to find hollnagel and bci in contempt.the court did so,ordered them to fully comply with the subpoenas within two days,and imposed a fine for any noncompliance after that date.the court later rescinded the fine,but left the contempt order in place and ordered hollnagel and bci to pay the sec attorney fees.
hollnagel and bci appealed,raising several procedural challenges to the district court order.first,they contend that a contempt order can not issue for noncompliance with a nonparty subpoena duces tecum unless the recipient of the subpoena is first ordered by the court to comply.in the alternative they claim that the sec motion for a rule to show cause notified them only that the sec was seeking a order setting a future hearing date on the contempt motion,not that the court would immediately adjudicate whether they were in contempt.accelerating the process,they maintain,deprived them of notice and an opportunity to be heard.
we reject the first of these arguments.rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure specifically provides that a person who fails without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena may be held in contempt.the rule does not require the court to first order compliance before imposing the sanction of contempt,although subsection c of the rule requires an intervening court order if the recipient of the subpoena objects in writing to the production of documents or things.hollnagel and bci did not serve a written objection,so the sec was entitled to seek a contempt sanction.we agree,however,with the alternative argument that the sec notice and motion for a rule to show cause did not provide sufficient notice that the district court would decide the contempt issue at the initial hearing.the notice sought only the issuance of a order and asked the court to set a hearing at which the merits of the contempt issue would later be adjudicated.accordingly,we vacate the contempt order.
background 
in litigation between the sec and hyatt johnson capital,lawyers for the sec issued two subpoenas duces tecum to nonparties brian hollnagel and bci aircraft leasing collectively bci.the subpoenas were issued in june and august and requested a large number of documents related to the underlying litigation.bci received a extension from the sec for the june subpoena and responded in july by producing numerous documents on a cd.the sec thought the production was deficient because some of the did not contain their original attachments or had attachments that were not produced in their native format.twice the sec requested that bci cure the deficiencies each time bci attempted to do so,the sec lawyers found problems with the production.after receiving the august subpoena,bci again asked the sec for two extra weeks to respond.the sec rejected this request on august,due date set in the on the continuing dispute over the adequacy of bci compliance with the june subpoena.
on the afternoon of august,thursday before labor sec filed a motion in the district court seeking the issuance of a rule to show cause why bci should not be held in contempt for noncompliance with the subpoenas.the notice accompanying the motion told bci that the sec would appear in the district court at on september,the wednesday after labor day,and would then and there present,and seek a hearing date regarding its motion for the issuance of a rule to show cause.the motion asked the court to order bci to fully and completely respond to the sec subpoenas and order bci and hollnagel to show cause why they should not be held in contempt of court.in a memorandum filed in support of the motion,the sec requested the same relief.in the last paragraph of the memorandum,however,the sec also asked the court to find bci and hollnagel in contempt and award attorney fees.
bci did not appear at the september hearing.when the case was called and bci nonappearance was noted,the sec lawyers told the judge w e here today on our contempt motion against bci aircraft leasing and hollnagel for not complying with three sic subpoenas issued to them.they asked the court to order that bci and hollnagel make a complete and proper production by noon on september.they also asked the court to find bci and hollnagel in contempt for failing to respond to these subpoenas completely and proposed a fine of per day if complete production was not made by the september deadline.finally,they asked the court for an award of attorney fees.the court orally entered these orders as requested.at the sec suggestion,the judge ordered the matter continued to september to report back on where we are.
later that same day,the court issued two conflicting written orders purporting to record what transpired during the morning hearing.the first,a summary minute order,stated hearing held and continued to at response due by noon to plaintiff motion for order to show cause against bci bci says that it understood this as an order directing it to submit a s how cause response on the contempt issue by the september deadline and setting a hearing on the matter at on september.the second order,prepared by the sec and issued after the minute order,was quite different.it made findings adjudicating bci in contempt and ordered full,proper,and complete compliance with the subpoenas by noon on september.the order also imposed a fine of for every day of noncompliance thereafter,including weekends and holidays.finally,this second order awarded the sec its costs and reasonable attorney fees and directed the agency to file an appropriate fee petition.
the next day,september,the district court entered a docket entry striking the first of the written orders entered on september.bci immediately moved to vacate the september order finding it in contempt.bci argued first that the contempt motion was not properly before the court on september.based on the contents of the notice accompanying the sec august motion,bci argued that the september hearing was essentially only a scheduling hearing.bci also attempted to explain why it was not in contempt.on september,in accordance with the terms of the stricken minute order,bci filed a response to the sec motion for a rule to show cause.the court struck this response as moot.also on september,bci sent another production of subpoenaed documents to the sec.the sec considered this latest attempt at compliance deficient.during the course of the next week,bci sent two additional productions attempting to address the asserted deficiencies.
on september,the district court denied bci motion to vacate the contempt order.the september hearing was continued to september,and on that date the judge addressed whether bci had complied with the subpoenas as ordered.concluding that bci was making a reasonable effort to comply,the judge continued the hearing to october.bci made yet another production of documents several days later.finally,at the october hearing,the judge found that bci had substantially complied with the september order to compel production and therefore rescinded the fine.the court left the rest of the contempt order in place,however,and required bci to pay the sec attorney fees.the sec submitted a bill for more than in fees,which the district court reduced to just under.bci appealed.
ii.discussion 
civil contempt is a unique civil sanction because its aim is both coercive and compensatory.prima tek ii,llc klerk plastic,cir.the coercive aspect of the remedy is not at issue here.to prevail on a request for a contempt finding,the moving party must establish by clear and convincing evidence that a court order sets forth an unambiguous command the alleged contemnor violated that command the violation was significant,meaning the alleged contemnor did not substantially comply with the order and the alleged contemnor failed to make a reasonable and diligent effort to comply.id.
bci argues that a subpoena duces tecum issued by an attorney is not a court order and therefore the district court could not hold bci in contempt simply for failing to comply with the sec subpoenas.the first element of contempt requires the moving party to point to a decree from the court which set s forth in specific detail an unequivocal command which the party in contempt violated.stotler able,cir quoting ferrell pierce,cir.bci contends that this prerequisite was not met here because the subpoenas issued by the sec attorneys were not court orders.bci claims that before adjudicating the contempt motion,the district court first had to issue an order compelling compliance with the sec subpoenas.
this argument runs into difficulty under certain provisions in the procedural rules applicable to discovery subpoenas.rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure explains that a civil subpoena may issue in one of two ways.the clerk of the court may issue a subpoena s igned but otherwise in blank,which is then completed by the requesting party.a.alternatively,an attorney may also issue and sign a subpoena as an officer of a court in which the attorney is authorized to practice or a court for a district where a deposition is to be taken or production to be made,if the attorney is authorized to practice in the court where the action is pending.id.
rule e speaks directly to the power of the district court to hold the recipient of a subpoena in contempt the issuing court may hold in contempt a person who,having been served,fails without adequate excuse to obey the subpoena.e.the contempt provision in subsection e does not distinguish between subpoenas issued with some court issued in blank by the court clerk and completed by the party who requests those issued without any court involvement at all by an attorney as an officer of the court.instead,subsection e of rule broadly refers to the contempt power of the issuing court,which implies that all discovery subpoenas are orders of the court whether issued in blank by the clerk or by an attorney as an officer of the court.
the advisory commit tee notes confirm this reading of the rule.the commentary explains that a lthough the subpoena is in a sense the command of the attorney who completes the form,defiance of a subpoena is nevertheless an act in defiance of a court order and exposes the defiant witness to contempt sanctions.a advisory committee note amend.nothing in rule or the accompanying commentary purports to limit the contempt power to subpoenas issued with more direct district court involvement or to require an intervening court order when the subpoena is issued by an attorney.
there is limited appellate caselaw on this issue,but that which exists supports this understanding.see pennwalt,cir a subpoena duces tecum is itself a court order,and noncompliance may warrant contempt sanctions,but noting that when the person subpoenaed objects in writing,the party seeking discovery must obtain a court order directing compliance before contempt will be available fisher marubeni cotton,cir explaining the distinction between rule sanctions for failure of a party to comply with a discovery request and rule sanctions for failure of a nonparty to comply with a discovery subpoena.accordingly,we reject bci argument that a subpoena issued under rule a by an attorney as an officer of the court is not itself a court order subject to contempt sanctions if disobeyed.
it does not follow,however,that a contempt motion for disobedience of a nonparty subpoena should be treated in exactly the same way as a contempt motion for violation of another kind of court order.as the commentary to rule e explains 
in at least some circumstances,a might be guilty of contempt for refusing to obey a subpoena even though the subpoena manifestly overreaches the appropriate limits of the subpoena power.but,because the command of the subpoena is not in fact one uttered by a judicial officer,contempt should be very sparingly applied when the witness has been overborne by a party or attorney.
e advisory committee note amend.citation omitted.rule also contains important provisions to protect the recipient of a subpoena from undue burden or expense,invasion of a privilege,or disclosure of protected material.see.c.for example,under rule c,intervening court involvement is required prior to initiation of contempt proceedings if the recipient of the subpoena serves a written objection on the party or attorney designated in the subpoena.c b.on receipt of such an objection,the party serving the subpoena may move the issuing court for an order compelling production or inspection,and the production or inspection may be required only as directed in the order.c b i ii.also,rule c describes the circumstances under which the court must or may quash or modify a subpoena.see.c.these provisions suggest at a minimum that contempt motions for noncompliance with a discovery subpoena should be entertained with special attention to the procedural and substantive rights of the nonparty witness.
here,bci did not serve a written objection or move to quash or modify the subpoenas.the sec therefore was not required to first obtain a court order compelling compliance with its subpoenas before initiating contempt proceedings.as a general matter,however,the more prudent practice for the court is to issue such an order before entertaining a motion for contempt.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.the district judge normally will preface a contempt citation with an order directing either compliance with the subpoena or a showing of an excuse for the noncompliance.the problem here is not that the sec could not move for contempt without an intervening court order compelling compliance the problem is that the notice and motion did not provide adequate notice that the sec would ask for a finding of contempt at the initial hearing on the motion for a rule to show cause.
due process requires that a person facing contempt sanctions be given adequate notice and fair opportunity to be heard in civil contempt proceedings.see,autotech techs.lp integral research dev,cir.this minimally includes a requirement that notice be given of the time and place of hearing on the propriety of a contempt order.am.fletcher mortg.bass,cir charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.d ue process does require that any civil contemnor be given certain basic procedural protections before being subject to any sanction adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.in this context,the focus must be on notifying the alleged contemnor,rather than on the formalities of notification procedures.autotech,at.
it is undisputed that bci was on notice that the sec was charging it with contumacious noncompliance with the subpoenas that much was clear from the sec motion.bci argues more particularly that it did not have sufficient notice that the district court would be asked to decide whether a contempt order should be issued at the september hearing.based on the specific contents of the notice and motion,we agree.no doubt it was unwise for bci to consider its presence at the september hearing to be optional.but the sec use of the procedural device of a motion for a r
