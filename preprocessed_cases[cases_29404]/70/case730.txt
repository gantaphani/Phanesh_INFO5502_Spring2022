factual and procedural background 
in august,lucian day and gussie day collectively the days filed a third amended complaint against collingwood and others.in march,collingwood filed a motion for summary judgment.
on april,collingwood served,but did not file,a motion for sanctions against the respondents.in his motion,collingwood asserted that the days action against him was frivolous and that a ny reasonable person would have dismissed collingwood long ago collingwood also served a memorandum in support of his motion.on april,attorney quinn filed an opposition to collingwood motion for summary judgment on behalf of the days.
on may,the trial court granted collingwood motion for summary judgment.on june,the court entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of collingwood.
on october,collingwood filed a motion for sanctions with the supporting memorandum he had previously served on respondents.respondents filed an opposition to the motion for sanctions,and collingwood filed a reply.
on november,the trial court issued a tentative ruling on collingwood motion for sanctions.the ruling stated in relevant part 
the motion of defendant fred collingwood for monetary sanctions against lucian day and gussie day and their attorney,darren quinn is denied.the motion is moot,as t he purpose of section is to deter frivolous actions and give the offending party the opportunity to withdraw or otherwise correct the pleading.banks hathaway,perrett,webster,powers chrisman th,d banks.a judgment of dismissal was entered in this case on june.a section sanctions motion served and filed by a defendant after judgment has been entered can not properly be granted if the conduct alleged to be sanctionable is the improper filing advocating of the plaintiff complaint.id.at d,quoting barnes department of corrections th,d barnes.accordingly,because collingwood motion is based on his belief the third amended complaint allegations lacked evidentiary support,the motion is denied.italics added.
that same day,after hearing argument from counsel,the trial court confirmed its tentative ruling.
on december,collingwood filed a notice of appeal of the trial court november order.
discussiona.appealability 
respondents claim the appeal must be dismissed because the november order is not an appealable postjudgment order.
section provides in relevant part 
a an appeal,other than in a limited civil case,may be taken from any of the following 
from a judgment 
from an order made after a judgment made appealable by paragraph.
in lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d,lakin,the supreme court considered whether an order denying attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision a was an appealable postjudgment order.the lakin court noted that,notwithstanding the broad statutory language of section,not every postjudgment order that follows a final appealable judgment is appealable 
to be appealable,a postjudgment order must satisfy two additional requirements the first requirement is that the issues raised by the appeal from the order must be different from those arising from an appeal from the judgment.citation.the reason for this general rule is that to allow the appeal from an order raising the same issues as those raised by the judgment would have the effect of allowing two appeals from the same ruling and might in some cases permit circumvention of the time limitations for appealing from the judgment.citation.
the second requirement is that the order must either affect the judgment or relate to it by enforcing it or staying its execution.citation.under this rule,a postjudgment order that does not affect the judgment or relate to its enforcement is not appealable citation.lakin,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
with regard to the first requirement,the lakin court summarily held,a n appeal from the order denying attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision o,plainly raises issues different from those arising from the judgment itself.lakin,supra,cal th at,d.with regard to the second requirement,after reviewing the case law regarding the characteristics of various appealable postjudgment orders,the lakin court held t he order here in issue is a postjudgment order that affects the judgment or relates to its enforcement because it determines the rights and liabilities of the parties arising from the judgment,is not preliminary to later proceedings,and will not become subject to appeal after some future judgment.therefore,it is appealable.id.at,d.
in shelton rancho mortgage investment th,d shelton,the court of appeal applied lakin in holding that a postjudgment order denying a request for sanctions under section was an appealable order.the shelton court reasoned that the order constituted a final determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties arising from the judgment,and that it was not preliminary to some future judgment from which the order might be appealed.see also in re marriage of dupre th,d following shelton and lakin in concluding minute order denying sanctions pursuant to family code section was appealable postjudgment order.
in this case,respondents argue that the trial court order denying sanctions is not appealable because the issues on appeal would be essentially the same as in an appeal of the underlying summary judgment.we disagree with this contention.the issues in an appeal from a summary judgment and those in an appeal from an order denying sanctions are plainly distinct.see lakin,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,we conclude that the first requirement for appealability discussed in lakin is satisfied.
with regard to the second requirement,respondents rely on lubetzky friedman d.lubetzky,in arguing that a postjudgment order denying sanctions is not appealable because it does not enforce or stay the underlying judgment.the lubetzky court stated that it had serious doubt as to whether an order denying sanctions under section was an appealable postjudgment order because the order did not affect the judgment or relate to it either by enforcing it or staying its execution.citation.lubetzky,supra,d at.however,in lakin,the supreme court found the lubetzky court reasoning unpersuasive,noting that the lubetzky court provided no analysis to support its equivocal appealability determination.lakin,supra,cal th at,d.the shelton court noted that lakin had cast doubt on the reasoning of lubetzky and explained that the reasoning in lakin is applicable,and it trumps the equivocal holding in lubetzky.shelton,supra,th at,d.
we agree with the reasoning of shelton,and with its application of lakin.a postjudgment order denying a motion for sanctions,whether pursuant to section as in shelton or section as in this case,is a final determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties arising from the judgment,and is not preliminary to some future judgment from which the order might be appealed.we therefore conclude that a postjudgment order denying sanctions pursuant to section is an appealable order pursuant to section,subdivision a.thus,the trial court november order is an appealable postjudgment order.
b.the trial court erred in denying collingwood motion as moot on the ground that the motion was filed after judgment was entered 
the trial court had jurisdiction to consider collingwood postjudgment motion for sanctions 
respondents claim that collingwood motion was per se untimely,because it was filed after judgment was entered.although respondents argument is not clearly styled as a jurisdictional argument,we consider whether the trial court had jurisdiction to consider collingwood postjudgment motion.we apply the de novo standard of review to this claim.see in re conservatorship of estate of kane th,d appeal presents pure issues of law concerning the jurisdiction and authority of the probate courts,as to which we must exercise de novo review.
in frank annino sons construction,mcarthur restaurants,d.frank annino,the court acknowledged the general rule that once a person has been dismissed from an action he is no longer a party and the court lacks jurisdiction to conduct any further proceedings as to him.accord ramon aerospace th,d ramon a final judgment terminates the litigation between the parties and leaves nothing in the nature of judicial action to be done other than questions of enforcement or compliance witkin,cal.procedure ed jurisdiction,jurisdiction over a cause or parties after a final judgment,order or decree is exceptional and limited to special situations.however,the frank annino court also observed that e ven after a party is dismissed from the action he may still have collateral statutory rights which the court must determine and enforce.frank annino,supra,d at.among these collateral rights are the right to statutory costs and attorneys fees and the right to notice and hearing on a motion to set aside the dismissal.citations.ibid.applying these principles,the frank annino court held that a trial court had jurisdiction over a party sanctions motion pursuant to section even though the party had been dismissed from the case.frank annino,supra,d at.see also west coast development reed th,d west coast development concluding trial court had jurisdiction to consider motion for sanctions pursuant to section filed after dismissal of case and analogizing sanctions motion to a motion for costs.
similarly,in cooter gell hartmarx,d cooter gell,a party filed a motion pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure,rule rule prior to the opposing party voluntary dismissal of its complaint.the federal district court did not rule on the motion for approximately three and years,apparently due to other proceedings between the parties.cooter gell,supra,at.in considering whether the dismissal of the complaint deprived the district court of jurisdiction to consider the sanctions motion,the united states supreme court ruled that a district court has jurisdiction to rule on a sanctions motion under rule even after termination of the underlying action 
it is well established that a federal court may consider collateral issues after an action is no longer pending like the imposition of costs,attorney fees,and contempt sanctions,the imposition of a rule sanction is not a judgment on the merits of an action.rather,it requires the determination of a collateral issue whether the attorney has abused the judicial process,and,if so,what sanction would be appropriate.such a determination may be made after the principal suit has been terminated.cooter gell,supra,at.
in powell squire,sanders dempsey,powell,vacated in part on another ground cir,the court,applying cooter gell,held that it had jurisdiction to rule on a party motion for sanctions that was filed two weeks after the court had granted the party motion for judgment on the pleadings,and entered a final judgment in favor of the party.
the courts in frank annino,west coast development,and cooter gell each considered a request for sanctions filed after a party voluntary dismissal of a complaint frank annino,supra,d at.west coast development,supra,th at,d cooter gell,supra,at.the reason for allowing a sanctions motion to be filed and decided after a plaintiff voluntary dismissal is particularly strong,since a contrary rule would allow a party to avoid sanctions by simply dismissing the action without prejudice.frank annino,supra,d at.
powell and the present case,in contrast,involve requests for sanctions filed after entry of a judgment.see powell,supra.at.however,in our view,this procedural distinction does not affect the analysis of the jurisdictional question.the rationale of the courts in frank annino,west coast development,and cooter gell for considering sanctions motions filed after dismissal was,at least in part,that a sanctions motion is a collateral proceeding that is not directly based on the merits of the underlying proceeding.this would be true whether the final resolution of the underlying matter is by voluntary dismissal or a judgment.further,a trial court consideration of a postjudgment sanctions request does not undermine the finality of the merits of the judgment.see ramon,supra,th at,d stating that a trial court lacks jurisdiction to consider a motion for reconsideration after entry of judgment because a party obtaining a judgment must be entitled to rely on that judgment and the opposing party must use statutory methods to attack the judgment in the trial court or must file an appeal,and the party must take those steps within specified time periods.
even without a jurisdictional bar to the imposition of postjudgment sanctions,in considering whether to impose sanctions,the trial court is statutorily required to consider any delay in filing a sanctions motion.section,subdivision c requires that,in determining what sanctions,if any,should be ordered,the court shall consider whether a party seeking sanctions has exercised due diligence.in a similar vein,in cooter gell,the united states supreme court stated that although a voluntary dismissal did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction to consider the motion for sanctions,ordinarily sanctions issues will be determined no later than by the end of a case 
although rule does not establish a deadline for the imposition of sanctions,the advisory committee did not contemplate that there would be a lengthy delay prior to their imposition,such as occurred in this case.rather,it is anticipated that in the case of pleadings the sanctions issue under rule normally will be determined at the end of the litigation,and in the case of motions at the time when the motion is decided or shortly thereafter.advisory committee note on rule.cooter gell,supra,at.
we conclude the trial court had jurisdiction to consider collingwood postjudgment motion for sanctions.
section does not require that a motion for sanctions be filed before the court renders a dispositive ruling on the pleading or motion as to which sanctions are sought 
collingwood claims the trial court erred in denying his motion as moot on the ground that it was filed after judgment was entered.we apply the de novo standard of review to this claim.see barnes,supra,th at,d whether party complied with safe harbor provision of sanction statute is one of statutory interpretation,which is a pure question of law.
in banks,the court of appeal outlined the procedural prerequisites to the imposition of sanctions pursuant section 
section requires that an attorney in a civil action sign all pleadings,petitions,notice of motions and other similar papers,subd.a.the signature indicates that the attorney certifies that the paper is not being presented for an improper purpose the legal contentions are warranted by law or nonfrivolous argument for extension,modification or reversal of existing law the allegations and factual contentions have evidentiary support or are likely to have such support after a reasonable opportunity to further investigate and the denials of factual contentions are warranted by the evidence,subd.b.if the court determines,after notice or a reasonable opportunity to respond,that the attorney improperly certified the document,it may impose an appropriate sanction,subd.c.citation.
section,subdivision c requires that the party seeking sanctions follow a procedure.first,the party must serve a notice of motion for sanctions on the offending party at least days before filing the motion with the court,which specifically describes the sanctionable conduct.citation.service of the motion on the offending party begins a safe harbor period during which the sanctions motion may not be filed with the court.citation.if the pleading is withd
