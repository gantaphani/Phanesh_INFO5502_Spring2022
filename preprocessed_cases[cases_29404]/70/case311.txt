this case involves a licensing dispute between two companies that operate in the pot cover business.prima tek ii ptii,in essence,gave klerk plastic klerks permission to use its technology to create superior pot covers in exchange for a royalty fee on each sale.the agreement between the parties delineated the type of product that klerks was to sell,and it limited klerks ability to sell to particular entities in specified regions.ptii claims that klerks breached this agreement,and,in addition to damages,seeks to have klerks held in contempt.the district court held that there were no material breaches of the licensing agreements,and that ptii failed to prove damages.we affirm.
background 
in january of,klerks entered into a license agreement with highland supply corporation highland.this agreement authorized klerks to manufacture and sell certain flower pot covers subject to patents and patent applications in the united states and holland.the two parties entered into a similar licensing agreement in authorizing klerks to sell flower pot covers in canada.soon thereafter,highland assigned its rights under the agreements to ptii.both companies met on july,to discuss klerks rights and obligations under the licenses as certain patents were about to expire.four days later,ptii filed suit seeking damages resulting from an alleged breach of the license agreements.the agreements generally control what types of pot covers klerks can sell,to whom it can sell the covers,and where the covers can be sold.
on september,the parties arrived at an agreement where they amended the license agreements and settled the litigation.after ptii filed a motion to enforce this settlement agreement,the trial court issued an order on april,the april order,incorporating the settlement agreement and licenses and dismissing the lawsuit while maintaining limited jurisdiction to enforce its order.ptii thereafter alleged that klerks had breached provisions of the licenses,and on october,the trial court granted ptii request for discovery.at that point,ptii terminated the licenses and klerks stopped manufacturing and selling pot covers 
the language of the licenses,which is in part what is at issue in this case,provides that 
ptii hereby grants to klerks holland the nonexclusive license to manufacture and sell only in holland and only in the united states upgrade plant covers only to customers under the trademark rights referred to in article ii and using or incorporating the technology referred to in paragraph which are absolutely essential for klerks holland to make and sell upgrade plant covers.
the term customers is defined as 
a horticultural growers of potted plants for use on such potted plants and b retail food supermarkets.the term retail food supermarkets means a retail business whose entire business primarily is the retail sale of food products,that is,considering the total sales of the consolidated business,at least eighty percent of such sales are for food products.the term customers specifically but not by way of limitation excludes excluded customers defined below.

any customer who is not a horticultural grower of potted plants or a retail food supermarket.excluded customers specifically includes but not by way of limitation businesses such as variety chains,mass merchandisers,discount chains,drug chains,buying clubs,craft and hobby stores,garden centers,and home improvement centers such as but not by way of limitation lowe,home depot,whether or not marketed at retail store sites,central buying offices or via catalogs or via electronic means by a website or via any other marketing channel.klerks will not,to its best knowledge,sell plant covers to a customer who resells those plant covers to an excluded customer.klerks shall not directly or indirectly sell upgrade plant covers to anyone who is not a customer and specifically can not sell to any excluded customers.
in total,between april,when the order was issued and june,klerks sold more than million plant covers for a total of in different transactions.as a part of these transactions,klerks paid ptii a total of in royalties.
after completing its discovery,on august,ptii filed a renewed motion urging the court to hold klerks in contempt.ptii claimed that klerks knowingly manufactured,offered for sale and sold i unlicensed plant covers,ii plant covers outside the licensed geographic territories,iii to un authorized customers,and iv incorrectly marked plant covers in addition to asking the court to hold klerks in contempt,ptii also sought proceeds from any and all sales made in violation of the april order,settlement agreement,and licenses.the district court made a judgment on partial findings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c ruling in favor of klerks.it held that ptii failed to meet its burden of producing clear and convincing evidence that klerks should be held in civil contempt for violations of the april order.the district court also found that while klerks did breach certain provisions of the license agreements,these breaches were not material,and ptii did not prove any damages that resulted from these breaches.
discussion 
ptii raises three issues on appeal.first,it asserts that klerks in fact did engage in material breaches of the license agreements attached to the april order.second,with respect to these breaches,ptii maintains that it has shown damages with sufficient clarity.third,it contends that klerks should have been held in contempt for alleged violations of the april order.we analyze each issue in turn.
ptii must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that klerks breached the contract.austin illinois.cl.we review de novo a district court determination of the meaning of an ambiguous contract term as well as the court factual findings following a bench trial.central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund kroger,cir.ptii contends that the district court used the wrong standard in assessing whether a material breach occurred here.it argues that the court used a clear error standard instead of the required preponderance of the evidence standard.however,the trial transcript makes it clear that the district court understood that the contempt standard is clear error and the breach standard is preponderance of the evidence moreover,apart from the district court statement on what standard it used in its order,the record the district court ptii was not entitled to damages because it produced virtually no evidence of any material breaches or damages.this clears both standards.
to be sure,klerks did breach portions of the agreement,but these breaches were not material.specifically,its sales to impack corporation,dunstan as groome,kinney bonded warehouse,sea venture overseas,and john shipping were made outside of authorized territories.also,klerks manufactured some nonconforming pot covers by improperly reversing the film in its machines.such production,however,was promptly stopped.overall,while some sales violated the terms of the license,more than percent did not.there were no material breaches,and a party can only be held liable for damages resulting from a material breach pacini regopoulos,d,finding no breach of an occupancy guarantee because occupancy rate was tantamount to a occupancy rate rubloff cb machesney world novelties,d,listing several factors relating to a finding of materiality the extent to which the party was deprived of the benefit that it reasonably expected the extent to which the party can be adequately compensated for the part of that benefit of which it will be deprived the extent to which the breaching party will suffer forfeiture the likelihood that the breaching party will cure its failure the extent to which the breaching party behavior comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing.
ptii tries to argue that klerks breached the agreement in additional ways that the district court either overlooked or failed to appreciate.in each case,ptii either mischaracterizes the facts or uses faulty logic.first,it attempts to label several of klerks sales as sales to garden centers,which are excluded customers according to the agreement.howe
