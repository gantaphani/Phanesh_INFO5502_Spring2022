world trade financial corporation world trade,jason adams,frank brickell,and rodney michel collectively,petitioners petition for review of the security and exchange commission commission order sustaining disciplinary action taken by finra the financial industry regulatory authority,which upheld a variety of fines and sanctions against petitioners for their violations of sections a and c of the securities act of,a,c securities act,which prohibit the sale or offer of sale of a security without filing a registration statement,id.in its opinion,the commission found that petitioners had traded unregistered securities and that the section brokers exemption of the securities act,which exempts brokers transactions executed upon customers orders from liability under sections a and c,was unavailable to petitioners because they had not met their duty of inquiry given the presence of many suspicious circumstances surrounding the sales.the commission also upheld the fines and sanctions imposed by finra and the national adjudicatory council nac for these section violations as well as for supervisory failures that violated the national association of securities dealers nasd conduct rules and establishing standards of supervision for registered representatives,principals,and other individuals associated with covered transactions.petitioners urge us to reverse and dismiss the commission order,or alternatively,to vacate the fines and sanctions and remand the case.
we conclude that substantial evidence supports the commission finding that petitioners violated sections a and c of the securities act,and we hold that petitioners did not meet their duty of inquiry necessary to claim the section brokers exemption.we defer to the commission discretionary determination as to the appropriate fines and sanctions because they are within finra guidelines and are supported by evidence in the record.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
world trade,a registered with the sec,has been a member of finra since,and petitioners michel and adams were its principals and owners at the relevant times.michel and adams shared responsibility for supervising the firm brokers and trading activity.michel had responsibility for establishing supervisory systems and overall compliance.adams handled client accounts,performed trading operations,and reviewed trade tickets he reported to michel.petitioner brickell joined world trade in as a general securities representative and now serves as a principal at the firm and as its chief compliance officer.
the world trade supervisory manual listed written procedures for the sale of restricted stock,or stock,which included unregistered stock that could be traded under the nonexclusive safe harbor provided in rule of the securities act those procedures included a list of conditions that a representative was required to meet before selling such securities,including obtaining current information on the company and the terms under which such stock should be sold.in practice,world trade employees identified restricted stock by checking whether the stock certificate deposited by the customer bore a restrictive legend the only process in place for handling stock that lacked a restrictive legend was to submit that stock to a clearing firm to be cleared,transferred,and sold.
the history of the shares at issue here,however,show the ease with which restrictive legends may be improperly removed.camryn information services,camryn was incorporated as a shell company in.camryn conducted no business,and in november,it entered into a reverse merger with istorage,a company in operation since may that had little operating history,no earnings,and was operating at a net loss of.
at the time of the merger,istorage had only four shareholders,all of whom had been shareholders of camryn.three of those shareholders each owned of the outstanding shares shares each.at their request,the law firm representing the shareholders issued an opinion letter incorrectly stating that their shares need not bear restrictive legends because the shareholders had held them for more than two years none of the shareholders had been an officer,director or shareholder of the company for the previous three months and that the shareholders were not affiliates of camryn under securities act rule k.the law firm opinion letter was clearly incorrect because the shareholders had held their shares within the previous three months.regardless,a transfer agent removed the restrictive legends from those camryn stock certificates,which were later converted into unlegended istorage stock certificates during the reissuance.on november,istorage issued a forward stock split for the shareholders and canceled the remaining shares,leaving those three shareholders with million shares represented by unlegended certificates,which they distributed to a variety of individuals and entities including stock promoters and marketers.
those shareholders paid three stock promoters,robert koch,his sister kimberly koch,and anthony caridi,in istorage stock for their work promoting the stock.robert koch opened an account with world trade in august,anthony caridi did so in november,and kimberly koch opened her account in december.between december,and march,world trade sold more than million shares of istorage stock to the public on behalf of these three customers.the kochs and caridi instructed brickell to wire the proceeds quickly,and he accordingly wired the profit shortly after the transactions cleared.brickell earned approximately in commissions on the sales.believing that his inquiry responsibilities were limited to questioning the transfer agent regarding restrictions,brickell acknowledged that he made no inquiry into the status or origins of the shares,despite the presence of several red flags,including that istorage was a development stage issuer that had a very short operating history the company had recently undergone a reverse merger,forward stock split,and name change the stock was thinly traded in the market and istorage had just begun trading shortly before the initiation of trading by the kochs and caridi.most of this information was publicly available on the pink sheets stock trading website,and brickell additionally knew that the kochs and caridi received stock as compensation for advertising services.
michel and adams also both believed that the transfer agent was responsible for investigating the status of unlegended stock,asserting that the regulatory scheme places this responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the transfer agent and the issuer and its counsel.petitioners also admitted,however,that neither the transfer agent nor the clearing firm considered itself responsible for conducting any inquiry on behalf of world trade.
the commission affirmed the conclusions of finra and the nac that petitioners violated section a and c of the securities act,as well as nasd rules and.the commission also affirmed the fines and sanctions imposed on petitioners for those violations.
we review the commission findings of fact for substantial evidence.steadman sec.and while we review the commission conclusions of law de novo,gebhart sec,cir,its findings of fact and law are only to be set aside when arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a ponce sec,cir.sanctions are reviewed for an abuse of discretion,vernazza sec,amended by cir,and should not be overturned unless unwarranted in law or without justification in fact,american power light sec.
petitioners argue that the brokers exemption applies to the transactions at issue and urge us to conclude that the exemption does not require reasonable inquiry.they argue that the supporting cases cited by the sec stand for the proposition that the sec carries the burden of showing that the section exemption was vitiated because of the presence of a statutory underwriter.however,this interpretation is contrary to established law.public policy strongly supports registration and the securities act is designed to protect investors by promoting full disclosure of information thought necessary to informed investment decisions.sec ralston
