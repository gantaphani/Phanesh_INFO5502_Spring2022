background and material facts 
the instant action arises from the decision of the first district court of appeal which affirmed the dismissal with prejudice entered by the trial court with regard to ham personal injury action against scott dunmire and all american termite and pest control,collectively,all american.see ham,so d at.in,suzanne ham initiated the underlying action seeking the recovery of damages for the injuries she suffered when the vehicle she was driving was by an all american vehicle driven by dunmire.this typical personal injury action was rendered even more basic by all american admitted negligence in causing the accident as alleged in ham complaint,leaving the issues of causation and damages in contention.
after ham initiated the action in november,the defendants did not respond,and in april of,ham submitted a motion for default demonstrating that all american had failed to serve or file any document or pleading in the case as required.a default was entered and it was not until february that all american moved to vacate the default and filed two supporting affidavits asserting that the respondents failure to file required pleadings was due to inadvertence and mistake a jury trial was set for september,to address the issues of causation and the extent and nature of the damages claimed by ham.in the order setting the case for trial,the trial court also set deadlines for the exchange of witness lists and proposed exhibits,and for the close of all discovery.
discovery proceeded between the parties.ham produced documents upon the request of all american,answered all american first set of interrogatories,and ham,herself,submitted to deposition.depositions were completed,health care providers were identified,and subpoenas for medical records were issued.however,at some point in the fall of,ham failed to comply with a single discovery order.she failed to timely respond to all american second set of update interrogatories,did not provide a formal witness list of the witnesses already disclosed during discovery,and allegedly did not appear at a meeting scheduled with opposing counsel to review prospective trial exhibits as a result of these alleged discovery infractions,all american submitted a motion for sanctions to the trial court.
after a brief unrecorded telephonic hearing on all american motion,the trial court issued a written order dismissing the action with prejudice based upon ham violation of two court orders one requiring the furnishing of a witness list and the other requiring ham to answer all american second set of update interrogatories.prior to dismissal of the action with prejudice,there were no previous sanctions or discovery violations and no consideration as to whether any prejudice had occurred.in a brief opinion,the district court affirmed the dismissal,despite record evidence demonstrating that ham counsel was wholly responsible for failure to comply with the trial court discovery orders.noting that the party herself was in no way at fault for the discovery violation,the district court certified conflict with the third district decisions in marin,dave aluminum siding,and herr.
it is well settled that determining sanctions for discovery violations is committed to the discretion of the trial court,and will not be disturbed upon appeal absent an abuse of the sound exercise of that discretion.see mercer raine,so d.reviewing courts apply a reasonableness test to determine if the trial court has abused its discretion,which provides that if reasonable people could differ as to the propriety of the trial court action,the action is not unreasonable,and no abuse of discretion has occurred.see id.citing canakaris canakaris,so d.while sanctions are within a trial court discretion,it is also well established that dismissing an action for failure to comply with orders compelling discovery is the most severe of all sanctions which should be employed only in extreme circumstances.mercer,so d at.in mercer,this court held that a deliberate and contumacious disregard of the court authority will justify application of this severest of sanctions,as will bad faith,willful disregard or gross indifference to an order of the court,or conduct which evinces deliberate callousness.id.citation omitted.
the dismissal of an action based on the violation of a discovery order will constitute an abuse of discretion where the trial court fails to make express written findings of fact supporting the conclusion that the failure to obey the court order demonstrated willful or deliberate disregard.see commonwealth fed.savings loan ass tubero,so d.express findings are required to ensure that the trial judge has consciously determined that the failure was more than a mistake,neglect,or inadvertence,and to assist the reviewing court to the extent the record is susceptible to more than one interpretation.see id.at.while no magic words are required,the trial court must make a finding that the conduct upon which the order is based was equivalent to willfulness or deliberate disregard.id.
moreover,to ensure that a litigant is not unduly punished for failures of counsel,the trial court must consider whether dismissal with prejudice is warranted.in,this court issued kozel ostendorf,so d as clarified,in which we stated that a dismissal based solely on the attorney neglect in a manner that unduly punishes the litigant espouses a policy that this court does not wish to promote.id.at.we articulated a test identifying six factors pertinent in the determination of whether a dismissal with prejudice is a warranted response to an attorney behavior.these factors require a trial court to consider 
whether the attorney disobedience was willful,deliberate,or contumacious,rather than an act of neglect or inexperience whether the attorney has been previously sanctioned whether the client was personally involved in the act of disobedience whether the delay prejudiced the opposing party through undue expense,loss of evidence,or in some other fashion whether the attorney offered reasonable justification for noncompliance and whether the delay created significant problems of judicial administration.
id.upon consideration of these factors,if a sanction less severe than dismissal with prejudice appears to be a viable alternative,the trial court should employ such an alternative.id.the kozel court acknowledged that the purpose of the florida rules of civil procedure is to encourage the orderly movement of litigation,and that such purpose usually can be accomplished by the imposition of a sanction that is less harsh than dismissal and that is directed toward the person responsible.id.
ham supports her position with the decisions of several district courts of appeal that have interpreted kozel as rendering misconduct on the part of the litigant himself or herself a prerequisite for dismissal.indeed,courts in at least three appellate districts have interpreted kozel as requiring a litigant personal involvement to justify dismissal.in schlitt currier,so d dca,the fourth district court of appeal reversed an order of dismissal resulting from the plaintiff numerous discovery violations and failures to file responsive pleadings.see id.at.the district court relayed that the conduct of plaintiff counsel resulted in thirteen motions to compel which were consistently granted,the imposition of monetary sanctions on three occasions,and several court orders threatening dismissal or default prior to the final order dismissing the complaint and entering a default judgment on the counterclaim.see id.after obtaining new counsel,the plaintiff moved to set aside the trial court orders and submitted an affidavit stating that he had no knowledge of the attorney handling of the matter,the trial court orders,and the imposition of sanctions.see id.acknowledging that courts in the district had interpreted kozel as precluding dismissal or default absent a showing of client participation in the misconduct,the district court remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the plaintiff knew of the attorney conduct,and if so,whether the actions were willful and deliberate.see id.at.the facts in schlitt were far more egregious than those we consider here.
the second district court of appeal has reached the same conclusion as that of the fourth district.in elder norton,so d dca,the district court reversed an order of dismissal emanating from a history of discovery abuses on the part of plaintiff counsel.see id.at.the district court determined that the sanction of dismissal was far too drastic in the absence of evidence demonstrat ing that elder ha d played an active role in abusing the discovery process.id.the district court closed by stating,we see no utility in punishing a faultless plaintiff when his or her attorney is solely responsible for the abusive conduct.id.again,the behavior in elder was far different than the facts exposed here.
while not as explicitly,the third district has also interpreted kozel as requiring litigant involvement in the misconduct to justify dismissal.in marin batista,so d dca,the district court reversed a trial court order dismissing an action due to misconduct on the part of plaintiff counsel with respect to speedy and fair resolution of the litigation.there,in a very brief opinion,the third district determined,s ince the record reflects absolutely no malfeasance on the part of the appellant,we find that the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing the appellant case.id.at citing dave aluminum siding,herr,and beauchamp collins,so d dca.the district court below certified conflict with the third district decisions in marin,dave aluminum and herr in holding that a lthough the party herself was in no way at fault,we affirm the judgment of dismissal,certifying conflict with the third district on this point.ham,so d at.
we reiterate that the interests of justice in this state will not tolerate the imposition of sanctions that punish litigants too harshly for the failures of counsel.we nonetheless maintain that the litigant involvement in discovery violations or other misconduct is not the exclusive factor but is just one of the factors to be weighed in assessing whether dismissal is the appropriate sanction.indeed,the fact that the kozel court articulated six factors to weigh in the sanction determination,including but not limited to the litigant misconduct,belies the conclusion that litigant malfeasance is the exclusive and deciding factor.the text of the kozel decision does not indicate that litigant involvement should have a totally preemptive position over the other five factors,and such was not this court intent.although extremely important,it can not be the sole factor if we are to properly administer a smooth flowing system to resolve disputes.
to the contrary,this court has long recognized the existence of circumstances where it may be appropriate to dismiss a litigant action based upon an attorney neglect.see beasley girten,so d,see also johnson landmark first bank,so d dca.in beasley,this court recognized that the interests of justice may support a dismissal with prejudice for a persistent refusal to comply with court orders.see beasley,so d at see also johnson,so d at affirming an order dismissing an action resulting from the plaintiff attorney failure to appear at various hearings and to comply with multiple trial court orders.precluding dismissal in those cases with extensive misbehavior even where the client is not involved in the misconduct would fail to recognize the principles of agency underlying relationships,and may not serve the goal and public interest of an orderly flow of cases through the judicial process.while not at all optimal,a party who is subject to a dismissal or default judgment due to the actions of counsel would have some recourse in the form of a legal malpractice claim against his or her attorney,but such only produces a multiplication of litigation and is not an acceptable alternative.therefore,because we hold that there may be circumstances involving such misbehavior by counsel in which dismissal is appropriate even absent the litigant involvement in an attorney misconduct,we must reject ham contention that her lack of personal involvement in the discovery infractions at issue alone precludes a dismissal of her personal injury action.
this determination does not,however,end our analysis in the instant matter because the sanction of dismissal in all cases must be a reasonable response to the discovery infractions committed.although a trial court unquestionably has power to discipline counsel for violating court orders,an action should not be dismissed when the malfeasance can be adequately addressed through the imposition of a contempt citation or lesser degree of punishment directly on counsel.see beasley,so d at.this principle was properly applied in clay city of margate,so d dca,where the fourth district reversed a trial court order dismissing an action due to the plaintiff untimely filing of a response to a motion for a more definite statement.see id.at.the district court reversed the trial court action,determining that the record was devoid of evidence showing that the failure to respond was a deliberate and contumacious disregard of the court authority,and concluding that a lesser sanction directed to the attorney would have vindicated the purpose of rules of civil procedure,namely to promote the orderly movement of litigation through the courts.see id.at.
the record in the instant matter does not support the trial court decision to dismiss ham action.the record shows that ham filed the complaint in and faithfully prosecuted the claim for a period of two years.see clay,so d at noting that plaintiff had actively litigated the case for over a year and a half prior to the untimely response,and had met deadlines in the past.in fact,in april of,it was ham who submitted a motion for default alleging that the corporate defendant,all american,had failed to comply with the rules of procedure and had not served or filed any document in the case as required.a default was entered against all american,which the trial court subsequently set aside.
while it is true that,despite her initial,diligent prosecution of the claim,ham ultimately violated court orders pertaining to discovery,examination of the record and the circumstances surrounding these failures plainly reveals that they did not warrant dismissal of ham action with prejudice.as was clear and as all american conceded in argument before this court,the second set of interrogatories were merely update interrogatories intended only to maintain the currency of the information provided by ham in her answers to the first set of interrogatories.moreover,the record reveals that ham actually answered the second set of interrogatories prior to the telephone hearing on all american motion for sanctions.thus,the discovery violations at issue in this case boil down to the untimely,but ultimately completed,update interrogatory responses,an asserted failure to submit a formal witness list thirty days prior to the trial date,and an apparent problem with the exchange of prospective trial exhibits.
this court understands and agrees that trial courts must be permitted to exercise sanctions as a means to discourage stonewalling between opposing counsel and assure compliance with court orders.however,dismissal of an action is unwarranted in a case,such as this,where more appropriate sanctions were available.in that regard,ham failure to file a formal witness list may have been adequately addressed by the trial court precluding her from examining at trial any surprise undisclosed witness.that was the sanction we expressly approved in binger king pest control,so d,where we held that a trial court could properly exclude the testimony of a surprise witness whose name had not been previously disclosed or listed in accordance with a pretrial order.see id.at.a similar sanction may have been appropriate for ham failure to exchange trial exhibi
